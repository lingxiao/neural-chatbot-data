Teacher...
What is the highest technique you hope to achieve?
- Very good.
What are your thoughts when facing an opponent?
There is no opponent.
Because the word "l" does not exist.
"... and to accept the consequences of his own doing."
In defiance of all our beliefs...
So, it is now for you to reclaim our lost honor.
My name is Braithwaite.
- Have some tea?
A tournament to which you' ve already received an invitation.
Specifically, a tournament organized by Mr. Han.
Han' s tournament.
"We," Mr. Braithwaite?
It' s Lahn' s time.
Yes, of course.
Kick me.
What was that?
An exhibition?
I said, "emotional content"...... not anger!
Now try again with meaning!
That' s it!
How did it feel to you?
Let me think.
Don' t think!
Feel!
It is like a finger pointing a way to the moon.
Don' t concentrate on the finger or you will miss...... all that heavenly glory.
Never take your eyes off your opponent.
Even when you bow.
That' s it.
There!
That' s Han.
That' s the only film we have on him.
We know that he was a member of your temple.
A Shaolin monk...... now a renegade.
Personal bodyguard.
Tough, ruthless, as you might expect, being Han' s bodyguard.
We got our hands on a demonstration film of Oharra.
All real bricks and boards.
Nothing phony about any of it.
This was before he picked up a facial scar somewhere.
This is where you' il be going.
An island fortress, really.
After the war...... the nationality of the island was uncertain.
And sometime after that, Han bought it.
What do you know about Han?
He lives like a king on that island, totally self- sufficient.
All of his efforts, seemingly...... are directed towards supporting what he calls his school of martial arts.
Han' s only contact with the outside world is this tournament...... which he holds every three years.
This was a stewardess, Mary King, found floating in the harbor.
Nothing unusual about a body in the harbor.
They had reported her lost at sea before the body was found.
What did the autopsy reveal as the cause of death?
She did not drown.
Yes.
Cause of death was a heroin overdose.
We know everything.
We can prove nothing.
We want you to go in there as our agent.
Get us our evidence.
And come out in one piece to give it to you.
We' il give you anything you need.
Electronic equipment, weapons, anything.
Drink?
No, thanks.
Guns!
Now, why doesn' t somebody pull a. 45, and bang, settle it?
No guns.
Look at this map here.
As you know, the possession of a weapon is a serious offense here.
Han' s island rests partly within our territorial waters.
If we were given any reason to believe that he has any kind of arsenal...... we' d move in on him.
Besides, Han would never allow guns on the island, anyway.
He had a bad experience with them once and he' s fearful of assassination.
Can' t really blame him.
Any bloody fool can pull a trigger.
I guess I won' t need anything.
There' s a radio on the island.
We' il be monitoring it on the chance that you can get to it.
And then you' il come?
We aren' t an agency of enforcement.
We function as gatherers of information.
Evidence upon which interested governments can act.
I see.
If there' s any trouble, you make a phone call.
Oh, by the way...... two months ago, we managed to place a female operative on the island.
Since then, we' ve lost her.
If she' s still there, she might have something.
Her name is Mei Ling.
Are you sure you won' t have one?
No, thanks.
Now the time has come to tell you something very difficult.
I am happy you have decided to go to Han' s tournament.
Yeah.
The last of the tournaments was held three years ago.
I was in the city with your sister...... at that time.
I didn' t know that.
Many of Han' s men had come in from the island.
They were everywhere, bullying and arrogant.
We were on our way into town.
Stay back!
Run!
Now you know the truth.
When you get to the city...... pay your respects to your sister and your mother.
I will, old man.
You will not agree with what I am going to do.
It is contrary to all that you have taught me.
And all that Su Ling believed.
I must leave.
Please try to find a way to forgive me.
Double or nothing?
That' s about $1, 000 a foot, Roper!
Why not?
I' m sorry, Mr. Roper isn' t in right now.
May I take a message?
That' s a tough shot, Mr. Roper.
Excuse me, fellows.
I say you can' t make it.
What will you bet?
You' ve got to love him.
Come on, Roper, it' s 175 big ones by Monday, the 15th.
Only 150.
You forget the interest.
Well, maybe I ought to talk to Freddie.
You take advantage, Roper.
It' s the dough, Roper, or we gotta break something.
You got it?
Freddie says this is for your own good.
Better confirm that flight to Hong Kong for me.
How much do I have left in the bank? $63. 43.
It' s all yours.
Thanks!
Only, I think you' il need it.
You want to bet?
Going on a trip, are you?
This jig' s got a passport!
Where are you going, jig?
Where' s the plane ticket for?
Hong Kong, via Hawaii.
He' s not going to Hawaii.
Well, look what we' ve got here!
Assaulting a police officer.
Roper!
Hey, how are you, man?
I' m glad to see you, that' s how I am.
How long has it been?
Five?
Six years, man.
Not as long as it seems.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
What have you been doing since 'Nam?
Hanging in a little bit.
- All these yours, man?
- Always first class.
Same old Roper.
Parsons.
Yeah, from New Zealand.
Know him?
No, never saw him before.
What do you know about this Han cat?
Just rumors.
I hear he likes to live big.
They don' t live so big over there.
Ghettos are the same all over the world.
They stink.
Same old Williams.
What have we got here?
A little action.
Insects.
I' il lay you $50 on the big one.
$50 on the big one.
All right?
Would you bet $100?
You' re on.
Come on, let' s end this thing quickly.
For crying out loud, would you believe that?
Do I bother you?
Don' t waste yourself.
What' s your style?
My style?
You can call it the art of fighting without fighting.
Show me some of it.
All right.
Don' t you think we need more room?
Where else?
That island, on a beach.
We can take this boat.
Okay.
Hey, what the hell are you doing?
Are you crazy?
Pull me in.
Pull me in!
Don' t try to pull yourself up...... or I' il let go of the line.
Would you look at that?
A woman like that could teach you a lot about yourself.
Welcome.
This way.
I' il show you to your rooms.
The banquet begins promptly at 8: 00.
I think you' il find our little island quite charming.
I hope you haven' t spent all that money you won from me yesterday.
I plan to win it back.
How?
You' il find out after you' ve lost it.
You seem to be very much at home here, Mr. Roper.
This guy, Han, has a great sense of hospitality.
And a fantastic sense of style.
Yeah, it' s great.
Then why are you so apprehensive?
Apprehensive?
No, I was just wondering whether it was okay to drink the water.
Mr. Roper, don' t con me.
Want to bet?
No, I really don' t think so.
Thanks.
What' s the matter?
Are you on a diet?
I' d like to eat if I could find something I could keep down.
I can' t wait to meet our host.
I hear this is only one of his "B" parties.
Have you ever been to a martial arts tournament like this?
Better keep an eye out for the referee.
Yeah.
You honor our island.
We are unique, gentlemen...... in that we create ourselves.
Through long years of rigorous training, sacrifice...... denial, pain...... we forge our bodies in the fire of our will.
But tonight, let us celebrate.
Gentlemen...... you have our gratitude.
Mr. Williams!
Mr. Williams!
For me?
You shouldn' t have.
But...... l' il take you, darling.
And you.
And you.
And you.
Please understand, if I missed anyone...... it' s been a big day.
I' m a little tired.
You must conserve your strength.
Come in.
A gift, Mr. Lee.
If you don' t see anything you like...
There was a girl at the feast tonight.
The owner of this dart.
Yes, I know the one.
I' il send her to you.
Another fine mess you got me into.
Well, well, one more lovely than the next.
What did you have in mind?
Pick one.
I already have.
A wise decision.
I want to talk to you...... Mei Ling.
Braithwaite.
Let' s be quiet.
Have you seen anything?
Nothing much.
I' m kept in the palace...... watched always.
I know nothing of Han' s activities away from the palace.
But I can tell you this:
- People disappear.
- Who?
Every one of them.
They' re summoned to Han' s at night, and the next day they' re gone.
I know I don' t have much time.
You must attend the morning ritual in uniform.
Outside.
Why are you not in uniform?
Gentlemen, let the tournament begin!
Bolo!
Good work, you made me some bread!
- Mr. Roper?
- I' m ready.
Okay.
I' ve got myself a real pigeon here.
Keep the action going for me, will you?
What do you think, Roper?
No sweat.
Give my friend eight to three all the way.
I' m finding out about myself.
This is the real me, definitely.
Do you like it here?
I mean here, on the island.
A little lower.
A man like you belongs here.
Where are you going?
It is not allowed.
You must stay.
Good- bye.
A human fly!
It seems that one of you...... was not content last night...... with the hospitality...... of the palace...... and sought diversion...... elsewhere on the island.
Who it was...... is not important at this time.
What is important is that...... my guards performed their duties incompetently.
And now they must prove...... themselves worthy to remain among us.
Are you shocked, Mr. Williams?
Only at how sloppily your man works.
Mr. Lee?
Boards don' t hit back.
Go!
Oharra!
Oharra!
Oharra' s treachery has disgraced us.
If you want to talk about this, I' il be in my room.
I got you.
Williams, come here!
I want you to go to Han' s study as soon as possible.
Hey, Roper, I' il see you in half an hour.
- Mr. Han?
- You fought well yesterday.
Your style is unorthodox.
But effective.
It is not the art but the combat you enjoy.
The winning.
We are all ready to win.
Just as we are born knowing only life.
It is defeat that you must learn to prepare for.
I don' t waste my time with it.
How so?
I' il be too busy looking good.
What were you looking for when you attacked my guards?
It wasn' t me.
You were the only man outside the palace.
I was outside, but I wasn' t the only one.
You will tell me who else.
Mr. Han, suddenly I' d like to leave your island.
It is not possible.
Bullshit, Mr. Han!
You come right out of a comic book!
Been practicing?
My friend, Williams, is expecting me in my room.
I wanted to talk to you.
We will meet your friend, Williams, later.
Okay.
This is my museum.
It is difficult to associate these horrors...... with the proud civilizations that created them.
Sparta, Rome, the Knights of Europe, the Samurai.
They worshipped strength...... because it is strength that makes all other values possible.
Nothing survives without it.
Who knows what delicate wonders have died out of the world...... for want of the strength to survive?
What' s this?
A souvenir.
Up here.
No thanks.
This is the only angle I care to see it from.
If you please, Mr. Roper.
You mean you want me to put my head on that thing?
An act of faith.
I' m a man of little faith, Mr. Han.
Very few people can be totally ruthless.
It isn' t easy.
It takes more strength than you might believe.
Now you' ve got eight more.
Then there is a point you will not go beyond.
Faked out again.
This way.
Our power plant.
A lifetime of women.
A man' s strength can be measured by his appetites.
Indeed, a man' s strength flows from his appetites.
Your daughters?
I' m sorry.
I thought...
I misunderstood.
Miss Han...
Also, they are my most personal guard.
I admire your judgment.
Nobody is as loyal as Daddy' s little girl.
Mr. Roper?
No, thanks, I' il get up myself.
Nice meeting you.
Opium!
We are investing in corruption, Mr. Roper.
The business of corruption is like any other.
Provide your customers with products they need, and...... encourage that need a little bit to stimulate your market and...... soon your customers will depend on you.
It' s the law of economics.
Right.
Here we are stimulating quite another need.
You wonder why I am exposing so much of myself?
I forget what I see very easily.
But then, why are you?
I' m hoping you' il join us, represent us in the United States.
I' m beginning to understand this tournament thing, the whole set- up.
It' s a great way to recruit new talent.
And who are they?
Refuse found in waterfront bars.
Shanghaied?
Just lost, drunken men who no longer care...... where they find themselves each morning.
You left some rather sizeable debts in America.
Diner' s Club hasn' t called in my card yet.
There were some questions which I was forced to ask.
I got no answers.
And you want me to join this?
There are certain realities.
I want us to have a clear understanding.
No.
Help me!
I' m only 17!
Help me!
Please, help me!
Come back, please!
You have to come back, please!
Quiet!
The battle with the guards was magnificent.
Your skill is extraordinary.
My God, this came in half an hour ago!
Why didn' t I...
Put your colonel on.
I don' t care if he' s not alone!
Damn it all, I don' t care who he' s with!
You bloody well put him on the line!
Good morning, Mr. Roper.
What' s going on?
What are you going to do to him?
Not me, Mr. Roper.
You.
Like you said...... there' s a point I won' t go beyond.
I was right about you.
I will find someone with whom you can fight.
Quick, go destroy them!
Kill!
Kill them!
Kill!
You have offended my family...... and you have offended the Shaolin Temple.
Remember...... the enemy has only images and illusions...... behind which he hides his true motives.
You made a mistake back on that island, Bond.
You took something that didn' t belong to you, from a friend of Mr Big' s.
That type of mistake is tough to bounce back from.
- But I' ve only just arrived.
- Today is your lucky day, Jim!
You' re going skydiving!
There' s a helluva view of the lake from 10, 000 feet.
My only regret is I won' t be there to see it.
Let' s go!
- Good morning.
You' re...
- Mrs Bell.
You' re not my instructor.
Where' s Mr Bleeker?
Indisposed.
I' il be giving the lesson.
What' s on for today?
Let' s just wing it, shall we, Mrs Bell?
You' re over- revving.
- Leroy, slow down, for Pete' s sake!
- Do what the man say!
I can' t find the brake!
Close those doors!
Holy shit!
OK, Don.
Right.
Talk to you later.
I' ve got to go and give a lesson.
Same time tomorrow, Mrs Bell?
Yes, Mr Bleeker.
Yes, sir.
I know you just can' t glue the wings back on.
Now, Mr Bleeker, I' m sure there' s no reason for name- calling.
That' s fine.
Don' t forget the double vents.
I appreciate she' s one of your best pupils.
That' s a little frantic.
I' il keep the other three.
Any such suggestion should be put in writing to Washington.
- How is Mrs Bell?
- Intensive care, but she' il pull through.
Yes, sir.
No one' s questioning your patriotism.
I' m sure you' re a veteran, sir.
Felix, find out if there' s a Fillet Of Soul restaurant in town.
We' re way ahead of you.
It' s on Docker Street.
Strutter' s watching it now.
Hell of a send- off.
This way.
- Where' s Strutter?
- He' s gotta be inside somewhere.
Two, gentlemen?
I got a nice booth over here, just against the wall.
Do you think you could find something a little closer to the stage?
- What' s wrong with a booth?
- I once had a nasty turn in a booth.
- Bourbon.
No ice, please.
- Two Sazeracs.
Where' s your sense of adventure?
This is New Orleans.
Relax!
- One of you Felix Leiter?
- Yeah, right here.
- Call for you.
- Thanks.
For a minute, I thought Harry was laying down on a job.
What happened to my...
- What happened to my friend?
- What happened?
Listen.
Thanks for droppin 'in, baby.
Yeah, you' re one tough pig to nail down.
You' ve been picking at me like some kind of maggot.
First, you go up to Harlem and kill one of the brothers.
And that disturbed me.
And then you go and steal this valuable young lady from my good friend, Dr Kananga.
Now, old Kananga, he believes in all that card crap.
I mean, he' s mad.
I would say Kananga is your problem now.
Thank you.
In fact, if I were you, I' d... watch my step from now on.
Yeah, well, you just let me handle our business with the man.
I got my own plans for you, baby.
But first there' s one little question that he wants answers for.
Then you' d better ship me back to the island and let him ask in person.
I' m not in the habit of giving answers to lackeys.
You damn lucky you got an ear left to hear the question with.
Which is... did you mess with that?
That' s between Solitaire and myself... and Kananga.
I' il tell him when I see him.
You won' t see sunlight unless you answer!
I' d no idea you were so frightened of him.
Did you touch her?!
When I see Kananga.
Right.
Quite revealing.
Kananga: poppy grower in thousands of acres of well- camouflaged fields, protected by the voodoo threat of Baron Samedi.
Then there' s Mr Big, distributor and wholesaler through a chain of Fillet Of Soul restaurants.
Wholesale?
Sell heroin, for money?!
My apologies.
I' m sure you simply give it away.
Excellent, Mr Bond.
That' s precisely what I intend to do.
Two tons of it, to be exact.
When entering into a fiercely competitive field, one finds it advisable to give away free samples.
I don' t discriminate.
Two tons of heroin with a street value well over a billion dollars nationally distributed free?
That should make a certain group of families rather angry, wouldn' t you say?
Angry?
Why, my dear Mr Bond, it' il positively drive them out of their minds.
- And subsequently out of the business.
- Quite ingenious.
A sort of junkies' welfare system.
Merely until the number of addicts in the country has doubled, shall we say?
Then I will market that acreage you blundered into the other day.
That heroin will be very expensive indeed, leaving myself and the phone company the only two going monopolies in this nation for years to come.
And here I thought it was Solitaire who did the fortune- telling.
Let' s hope for both your sakes she still can.
The question still stands, Mr Bond.
Asked by the gentleman concerned.
Did you touch her?
Well, it' s not the sort of question... a gentleman answers.
Well, having set the example, I don' t expect Miss Solitaire to be any less the lady.
By the way, that' s a particularly handsome watch you' re wearing, Mr Bond.
- May I see it, please?
- You' il forgive me if I don' t get up.
Butterhook!
Tee Hee.
On the first wrong answer from Miss Solitaire, you will snip the little finger of Mr Bond' s right hand.
Starting with the second wrong answer, you will proceed to the more... vital areas.
I want you to listen to me very carefully.
On the back of Mr Bond' s watch the registration number:
3- 2- 6 -
6.
Do I speak the truth?
You speak the truth.
Well,... if nothing else, at least I' ve laid your fears to rest.
My compliments on a splendid operation.
There is one thing, however, the...
Whisper.
Take him to the farm.
When do we start back?
Soon, Solitaire.
Soon.
Solitaire, why?
I treated you well.
You lacked for nothing.
I don' t understand what you...
Mr Bond' s watch, my dear.
I gave you every break possible.
You had a 50- 50 chance.
You weren' t even close.
I had no choice.
Please believe me...
The cards!
When the time came, I myself would have given you love.
You knew that.
You knew that!
There' s only one proper way to deal with this.
And one proper time.
The tonnage order is nearly complete.
We move it out tonight.
And I mean tonight!
Mr Bond.
How much do you know about crocodiles, Bond?
I' ve... always tried to keep them at arm' s length myself.
Cute little nippers, ain' t they?
I don' t suppose those potential overnight bags are orphans.
Oh, no!
We have some moms and dads as well.
In fact, quite a few thousand.
This is the part I like best: feeding time.
I suspect, the highlight of the tour.
Some of these babies live to be 200 years old.
Look over there.
That' s an alligator.
You can always tell by its round nose.
There' s old Albert.
He' s a croc.
Got careless with him some time back, and he took my whole arm off.
Well done, Albert!
They' il eat anything.
Even each other.
Then again, sometime they can go a whole year without eating.
I was rather counting on that.
There are two ways to disable a crocodile, you know.
I... don' t suppose you' d care to share that information with me?
One way is to jam a pencil into the depression hole behind his eyes.
And the other?
The other' s twice as simple.
You just put your hand in his mouth and pull his teeth out.
Fire!
Evans, get him!
Adam, in the car!
Head him off!
Hector, move, damn it!
Bond ripped off one of our boats.
He' s headed for the lrish Bayou.
The man that gets him, stays alive!
Now move, you mothers!
Toby.
I got me a regular Ben Hur down here.
Doin '95, minimum.
- Need any help, JW?
- Hell, no!
You got a set of wheels that just won' t quit, boy!
If they' s yours, that is.
You spin around, boy.
Ten fingers on the fender.
Legs apart.
I' m sure this ain' t exactly your debut at this sort of thing.
You picked the wrong parish to haul ass through, boy.
Nobody cuts and runs on Sheriff JW Pepper.
And that' s him speakin 'that, by the bye!
What the...
JW?
Soon as you nail that offendin 'vehicle, Miss Pearsonjust called.
Seems her dog' s foamin 'all at the mouth.
She' s got him locked up in the shed and wondered ifyou' d like to come over and shoot it for her.
You tell Miss Pearson to take a flyin '...
That look like a boat stuck in the Sheriff' s car there, Eddie?
Boy, where you been all your life?
That there' s one of them new car- boats.
I hereby do commandeer this vehicle and all those persons within.
And that means you, smartass!
Unit 23 in position.
Ten- four, 23.
Come in, 28.
Hey, JW.
Seems like Deke Rogers done got his boat stole offthe river but got a new one in his swimming pool.
- Sheriff, get your boys offmy frequency!
- Give me that!
Now you listen to me, trooper boy!
We got a swamp full of Black Russians drivin 'boats to beat the band down here!
Relax, Sheriff.
We' ve got a roadblock waiting for them at Miller' s Bridge.
Unit 26 at Miller' s Bridge.
We' re just about all set here.
Make that secure there!
D' you hear?
OK, fellas.
Here they come!
All right, out of my way!
I' m in charge here!
You two boys, come on!
I want those two men and their boats apprehended immediately!
Yes, sir, Captain.
I understand.
But, I don' t know where we' re gonna find a boat fast enough to catch 'em.
Call my brother- in- law, Billy Bob.
He' s got the fastest boat on the whole damn river.
Billy Bob' il sure enough fix their ass!
Yeah, call Billy Bob.
There' s two boats, Billy Bob.
They' re movin 'like buttered pigs!
Now, I promised these boys here you' d get 'em.
Don' t let me down.
Cool down, JW.
I' m on my way.
- Yes.
I' d like to borrow this boat, if I may.
Everybody on the river would like to borrow this boat.
Billy Bob, we' ve got 'em spotted.
They' re headed for Hayley' s Landing.
That' s my brother- in- law!
That' s Billy Bob!
He' il get 'em!
Billy Bob' il get 'em!
Hot damn!
If one side of the Pepper family don' t get 'em, the other side will!
Let' s go!
Iet him now speak, or else hereafter...
Headquarters to all units.
Suspects seen proceeding down by Liberty towards Highway 11.
Proceed with caution.
Would you get that chicken coop off the road?!
Did you ever think of gettin 'a driver' s licence, boy?!
Are you sure that was your brother- in- law, Sheriff?
- Felix, what are you doing here?
- We' il get to that later.
Kananga' s in town.
He' s got your girl.
They just took off.
There' s the son of a bitch!
I got him!
What are you?
Some kind of doomsday machine, boy?
Well, we' ve got a cage strong enough to hold an animal like you here!
- Captain, enlighten the sheriff, please.
- Yes, sir.
JW, let me have a word with you.
JW, now this fella' s from London, England.
He' s an Englishman workin 'in cooperation with our boys.
- A sort of secret agent.
- Secret agent?!
On whose side?!
We busted the Fillet of Soul an hour ago.
We came up with nothing but these.
Kananga' s clear.
You should have seen the size of the guy on the boat with him.
Nine feet tall, I swear.
Big top hat, a cockamamie flute in one hand and Solitaire in the other.
The incendiary bombs are set for midnight.
Now, that gives you exactly... 30 minutes.
Watch out for sharks on the way back.
We' il see you for breakfast, Felix.
Good hunting!
You' re going to need these and the shark gun on the way back.
Seems like the party' s started.
My regards to Baron Samedi, man - right between the eyes.
Trouble!
Mr Bond!
There you are!
And Miss Solitaire as well.
Hardly unexpected, but most welcome.
Whisper!
Two more glasses for our guests!
- What shall we drink to, Mr Bond?
- How about an earthquake?
Welcome home.
Where' s our boy?
He' il be along any time now.
I checked behind a rock and his wet suit is gone.
Keep the change.
It is unfortunate your wet suit was found only minutes before the field was destroyed.
Don' t tell me you' re not insured?
The poppy is a very sturdy flower.
You have been a relatively minor nuisance, in fact.
I find it particularly fascinating.
What is it?
A shark gun, naturally.
With compressed gas pellets.
Ingenious!
Don' t pull the pin out.
Somehow I never thought of you as a poor loser.
I was hoping you would join me to drink to the future.
Miss Solitaire used to know all about the future.
Especially predicting death.
An underground monorail.
Connected to the last refuge of a scoundrel, no doubt.
The heroin leaves here, I take it, carried somewhere by that winch.
Correct again, Mr Bond.
What a quick study you are.
Let me show you exactly how it works.
Where in hell can the man be?
Relax!
He must have got tied up somewhere.
These cans hold 25 pounds each.
There are 20 cans to a shipment, packed in watertight metal containers.
It' s your show, but isn' t there a simpler way of drowning someone?
Drown, Mr Bond?
I doubt you' d get the chance to drown.
Perhaps we could try something on an even simpler vein.
On the contrary, Mr Bond,
I think you' il find those wounds quite fatal.
Whisper...
The gate.
Slowly, Whisper, slowly, slowly.
Let our diners assemble.
Look out!
Where' s Kananga?
He always did have an inflated opinion of himself.
Oh, James!
How do we get out of here?
We take the train, of course.
Thanks for everything, Felix.
See you tomorrow night at the 21 Club.
Why do you want to travel this way?
What the hell can the two of you do on the train for 16 hours?
Say goodbye to Felix, darling.
Now, the first thing to learn in playing gin rummy is never take a card from the exposed pile unless you really need it.
Gin.
James!
What are you doing?
Just testing an old adage.
"Unlucky at cards..."
- Do hurry up, James.
- Won' t be a moment, darling.
Lock the door as well on your way up, would you, James?
After all, we wouldn' t want anyone to just walk in on us, would we?
For the first time in my life, I feel like a complete woman.
The slightest touch of your hand...
I was always so afraid that a part of me would stay with the past.
But now I know there' s no chance of that any longer.
To be able to reach out and touch you...
Mr Bond.
It' s good to see you again.
Well, that wasn' t very funny!
Now what are you doing?
Just being disarming, darling.
- Black jacket?
- Yeah.
lsn' t it hot for a long leather coat?
- Yeah, a little.
- Yeah.
Look at his partner.
They just came in.
Something' s getting ready to go down.
- Go and cover that guy.
- What' s going on?
I' il check out this asshole at the bar.
Billy will make sure I behave.
Will somebody tell me what' s going on?
No bullshit this time.
Just sit tight, Billy.
Philip!
Man, what' s happening, Phil?
He said you don' t come here no more, but I said, "It' s Phil".
- Get out of here, man.
- I told you!
- Give me a kiss, baby.
- I said get outta here!
Everybody freeze!
Turn around!
- Phil!
- Keep your hands on the table!
What' s wrong?
What' s all the hostility?
- Get back.
- What' s all this gun, man?
You changed.
Get back or I' il blow your brains out.
Police.
Move and I' il kill you.
Don' t move!
Turn over!
Way to go, Rosewood.
You know that?
Sorry for the disturbance, folks.
Everything' s under control.
Taggart.
Would you explain why you and Rosewood were in a strip bar out of our jurisdiction while you were on duty?
Before you chastise these officers, there' s something you should know.
The only reason they were at a strip bar is because they were tailing me.
They were outside wondering what I was doing.
I was in having a good time.
I' m into those things.
These guys waited outside and the only reason they came in was because they saw two men with bulges in their jackets going in.
Well, these guys were going to commit a robbery.
They watched them, waited for them to make their move, then foiled a crime.
I did not know what was going on.
I' m freaked out.
They must have a sixth sense.
I don' t know what you teach them, but they' re not just regular cops.
They' re supercops.
The only thing missing on these guys are capes.
ls this what really happened?
No, sir.
Would someone tell me what happened?
Well...
Foley invited us to this bar.
We accepted.
- We ordered club sodas, sir.
- Right.
And while we were there,
Foley observed the two suspects casing the establishment.
And before we knew what was going on, he' d already disarmed one of them.
Detective Foley deserves all the credit for the arrests, sir.
I would prefer you did it in Detroit.
I understand.
I' m sorry.
But before I go I want you two to know, the supercops story was working.
It was working and you guys just messed it up.
But it' s cool.
Just fuck up a perfectly good lie and it' s all right.
You guys are off the case.
Foster, McCabe, your turn.
- Don' t lose him.
- Not a chance, sir.
And you two...
ln my office.
Morning, gentlemen.
Coffee and doughnuts?
- What?
- Coffee and doughnuts.
There he is.
Morning, officers.
You the second team?
We' re the first team.
We won' t fall for a banana in the tailpipe.
You won' t fall for the banana in the tailpipe?
It should be more natural, brother, like this.
"I ain' t falling for no banana in my tailpipe." It' s more natural for us.
You' ve been hanging out with this dude too long.
I' m sorry, I' m just fucking with you.
That' s funny to me.
- You gonna try to keep up with me?
- No problem.
- lsn' t this Victor Maitland' s house?
- Yeah, I think so.
I' ve seen enough.
You want something to drink?
I got some stuff in the trunk.
Excuse me.
For a man on vacation, you look like you' re on a stakeout.
No, no.
I' m picnicking.
This is a picnic area.
I' ve been shooting the shit long enough.
Time for me to take in some sights.
Excuse me.
What the hell' s he doing?
Can you put this in a good spot?
This shit happened last time I parked here.
May I help you?
I' m looking for Victor Maitland.
You realise that this is a members only club?
I have to talk to Victor.
It' s very important.
- Victor Maitland, are you sure?
- Yes.
Grey- haired gentleman.
Very dark skin.
Capricorn.
Why don' t you give me the message and I' il take it to him?
Tell Victor that Ramon, the fella he met about a week ago...
Tell him that Ramon went to the clinic, and I found out that I have... herpes simplex 10.
I think Victor should check himself out with his physician before things start falling off on the man.
Perhaps you better tell him that.
- I think that would be best.
- So do l.
Hi, Victor.
I' m back.
Look, guys, don' t even try it.
Why don' t you get the hell out of here?
Get the fuck away from me, man.
Very good, Victor.
Could you teach him to roll over and sit, too?
- What do you want?
- I wanna talk to you.
- Last time, I didn' t get the chance.
- I' ve nothing to say to you.
That' s cool, I' il do all the talking.
This is a very nice place, Vic.
This is nice.
Glad you like it.
I must make you a member.
Victor, I know that you' re into a lot of crooked shit.
And I have a pretty good idea that you had Mikey killed.
I' m going to fuck you up real bad.
ls that so?
Now listen to me, my tough little friend.
I don' t know from under what stone you crawled or where you get these ridiculous ideas about me, but it seems painfully obvious you haven' t the slightest fucking idea who you' re dealing with.
Now, my advice to you is crawl back to your little stone in Detroit before you get squashed, OK?
- Please step away from the table.
- Gotta go now, Vic.
- Nice meeting you again.
- Yeah.
Catch you later, Vic.
I can' t wait.
Don' t I know you guys?
You look so familiar.
Detective Foley, this is becoming very irritating.
Why are you bothering Victor Maitland?
I had a friend, Michael Tandino, who used to work for him.
Maitland had him killed.
When I can prove it you' il be the first to know.
Forget what you can prove, talk to me.
Everybody knows Victor Maitland is a hotshot art dealer.
Art' s not the only thing he deals.
I saw some guys in his warehouse unloading a crate of German bearer bonds.
Michael Tandino had bonds like this on him, coincidentally, when he was killed.
Just because Maitland invests in the same bonds doesn' t mean he' s a killer.
The man' s not an investor, he' s a smuggler, be it bonds, drugs or whatever.
The crate I saw didn' t even pass through customs.
Maitland is paying to get his shipments out before they' re inspected.
When his guys get it, they take the drugs or bonds out of the crates and they send it back before customs even knows what' s going on.
- And you witnessed this?
- Everything except for the drugs.
But I found coffee grounds everywhere.
- Coffee grounds?
- What does that mean?
Drugs are packed in coffee.
The scent throws off the dogs.
Now what do we do?
Look, Detective Foley, I...
I' m sorry.
I' d really like to help you.
lf you' d found the drugs, that' s one thing, but if your only evidence is coffee, we can' t get a search warrant.
We can get around that.
We don' t "get around" search warrants.
Taggart, I want you to start checking this out.
Start with the LAPD, the FBl and the Customs Service.
Wait a minute.
Maitland is much smarter than that.
We snoop around, he' il close down and get his shipments from elsewhere.
Really? ls that what your extensive experience tells you?
I haven' t been on the force...
Shit.
- ls this the man?
- Yes, sir.
The gentleman that crashed through Victor Maitland' s window?
Who disabled an unmarked unit with a banana?
Yes, sir.
Who lured Taggart and Rosemont into a gross dereliction of duty at a striptease establishment?
It' s Rosewood, sir.
Yes, sir.
ls this the gentleman who ruined the buffet at the Harrow Club today?
Yes, sir.
I just bet you are the pride of your department in Detroit.
Lieutenant, I' d like to see you in your office.
Yes, sir.
ls this the man who wrecked the buffet at the Harrow Club today?
- Lower your voice.
- Can he hear me through the wall?
Yes, he can.
Rosewood, take Detective Foley back to his hotel room, watch him pack, and escort him to the city limits.
Then you can give him his gun back.
The two charges of disturbing the peace have been dropped against you.
But if you return to Beverly Hills, the charges will be reinstated and you will be prosecuted to the limit of the law.
- Sir, may I say something?
- What?
He seems to have enough...
You want to tell that to the chief?
- No, sir.
- Then I suggest you get moving.
Come on, Axel.
Let me check on that tomorrow and get back to you.
Thank you.
- Hi.
- Victor, hi.
- Sit down.
I' m not interrupting?
- Of course not.
There' s a gentleman in town from Detroit who says he' s a friend of Michael Tandino.
He came by the office yesterday and asked me all sorts of odd questions.
Excuse me, darling.
I believe his name is Foley.
Since you were a friend of Michael,
I was wondering if you knew the fellow.
We grew up in the same neighbourhood.
Really?
Have you seen him lately?
He came in yesterday.
What?
He came by here?
And?
He told me that Mikey had been killed.
Yes, I know.
- And then?
- That' s it.
He left and I haven' t seen him since.
Jenny, darling, do you know where he' s staying?
I have some information which might be helpful for him.
No, I have no idea.
I hope I didn' t disturb you.
- No problem.
- We' il have dinner soon, yes?
- That' d be lovely.
- Take care.
I read the manifests.
They' re expecting another shipment in today.
Bogomil...
This is a chance for me and you to blow this case wide open.
I wish I could, but I can' t.
Why?
Because Bogomil would kill me.
I' m not going to drive you to the art gallery.
It' s easy.
Jenny will let us in Maitland' s warehouse.
The shipment arrives, we nail them.
- How can you be sure it' il be drugs?
- I got a hunch.
A technique by which many crimes outside Beverly Hills get solved.
Why didn' t you tell Bogomil about this shipment?
He does everything by the book.
ls everybody in this town a robot?
This thing is very personal to me.
All he asked me to do was drive you out of town.
Now I' m going to screw that up, too.
Billy, I love you.
I just fell in love with you.
Jenny, how are you?
This is my buddy Billy Rosewood.
Jenny Summers.
- Billy' s a Beverly Hills cop.
- How do you do?
That' s Serge.
Can you get my friend an espresso?
You want it with a lemon twist?
Sure, if it' s no bother.
No, don' t be stupid.
Victor Maitland was here asking questions about you today.
He was acting real weird.
Look, I want to get back inside the warehouse.
How about I go with you?
You work in a gallery.
You' re not a cop.
lf this has to do with Mikey' s death, I want to check it out.
I don' t have time to argue with you.
Let me get my keys and we' il argue on the way.
Billy, you sit here and observe.
Don' t move till I get you.
- Why can' t I come in?
- Cos you' re a cop in this town.
Without probable cause, it' s an illegal search.
Didn' t they teach you that in cop school?
- I find some evidence, I' il get you.
- You can' t...
Be cool, all right? lf anything jumps off, I' il come and get you.
ls there any chance you' il let me go in by myself?
No chance.
Fuck.
Come on.
- Seems they' ve been already.
- What are you looking for?
This.
A crate from overseas that hasn' t passed through customs yet.
What is that?
Coffee?
Yeah, it' s coffee on top.
But this ain' t sugar.
Go get Rosewood.
Welcome to the party.
It seems we have guests.
I do like surprises.
Jeannette.
I just can' t tell you how disappointed I am to find you here.
Shut up!
I don' t want to hear it.
Take her to the car and wait for me.
What are you going to do with him?
You should be more worried about what we' re going to do with you.
Don' t worry.
We' ve got cocaine and coffee, we' re going to have a party.
Thanks for having me over, Vic.
This is very nice.
Did you say something?
lf something happens to her...
I' m all ears.
I' il kill you.
That would be a neat trick.
- Well, cuz.
- Are you still pissed at me?
No.
But I should have taken care of you in Detroit.
When I popped your little buddy.
Goodbye, Mr Foley.
- Have a nice day.
- I' il try.
Damn it.
Oh, boy.
How' s that little bump on the head I gave you in Detroit?
Healed up nice, I hope.
Freeze!
Thanks.
Tell Taggart to check out the warehouse.
I' il explain later.
Sergeant Taggart is here, he wants to talk to you.
Shit!
Billy, what the hell is going on?
- Sorry, Sarge, I can' t talk now.
- What do you mean?
Just check out the warehouse and please don' t say anything to Bogomil.
- He' s not transmitting any more.
- Shit.
- What' s the matter?
- Billy' s doing something dumb again.
- Was he calling from the hotel?
- No, sir.
Right now, his car' s heading north on Palm Canyon Road.
- We were there this morning.
- What?
Foley was looking over Maitland' s house.
- Do you have that warehouse address?
- Yes, sir.
Check that place out, let me know what' s going on over there.
Don' t talk to anybody but me.
Hold it, Foley.
You' re under arrest.
Billy, why are you here?
- I forced him at gunpoint.
- No, he didn' t.
Everything he said about Maitland is right.
He' s kidnapped a woman.
- Let' s get her.
- What do you think I' m doing?
- We' il have a warrant in 20 minutes.
- She could be dead in 20 minutes.
Stop.
You' re coming with us.
I' m going inside.
You want to stop me, shoot me.
Me, too.
You can do what you want, but I' m going in.
This is really serious trouble.
lf you' re lucky, you' il just get fired.
- Got it.
- This is my last warning.
I' ve got to.
Shit.
Wait a minute.
- What' s that?
- Looks like East Gate.
Punch it up.
Who the hell is that?
Better get Maitland up here.
Where is everybody? ls Rosewood back?
- No, sir.
- Seen Taggart?
He took off about 10 minutes ago.
Foley' s on the grounds.
How the hell should I know?
Get some people out there right away.
Don' t take your eyes off that screen.
Try to locate Taggart and Rosewood.
Come on.
- They must be away from the car.
- I can see that.
Keep trying.
- DD- 1 3, come in please.
- What' s their 20?
609 Palm Canyon Road.
Who lives at that address?
A Victor Maitland, sir.
- Let' s go around.
Come on.
Ready, one, two... three!
You all right?
What the fuck am I doing here?
Drop it!
- Good shot, Billy.
- Let' s go.
- Jesus Christ!
- These guys are serious.
I hate machine guns.
Cover me.
Go around front.
I' m going to check the back.
609 Palm Canyon Road.
Put out a 998, officers need assistance.
- Sir?
I want all north end units to roll.
South end units stay in their area.
Let' s go.
- Undercover officers at location.
Police!
You' re all under arrest!
Do that again, I' il shoot you myself.
Know what I keep thinking about?
Know the end of Butch Cassidy?
Redford and Newman are almost out of ammunition.
And the whole Bolivian army is out in front of this little hut.
I' m going to make you pay for this.
- Hanging around?
- Fuck, no.
Hold it right there.
Shit!
Be careful, old boy, it might hit me.
Freeze!
Police!
You' re all under arrest!
Lay down your weapons and take two steps back with your hands up!
Very good.
Great.
What the hell' s going on here?
Shit.
- What' s this man doing here?
- Bleeding, sir.
How come he isn' t wearing cuffs?
Well, he isn' t actually in custody, sir.
Place him in custody.
Or would you like me to?
Wouldn' t you like to hear my report first, sir?
You have a report that explains all this?
Yes, sir.
Well, I will be very glad to hear it.
Miss Jeannette Summers, the manager of Mr Maitland' s art gallery, accidentally discovered what she suspected was cocaine in the gallery' s warehouse.
She immediately communicated her discovery to Detective Axel Foley.
Detective Foley was, at the time, cooperating in a joint Beverly Hills- Detroit investigation.
Detectives Foley and Rosewood proceeded to the warehouse where Rosewood discovered approximately 80 kilos of cocaine.
Rosewood called for back- up and I despatched our officers.
Sergeant Taggart was the first on the scene.
Believing a felony was in progress, Sergeant Taggart joined Rosewood, with Detective Foley present only as an observer, and proceeded to enter the grounds.
ln defending ourselves, we shot several suspects, including Mr Maitland.
You expect me to believe that report?
That' s the report I' m filing, sir.
Sergeant Taggart, why don' t you tell me what happened?
Happened just like the lieutenant said, Chief.
Well, I suppose congratulations are in order.
Thank you, sir.
That report better be on my desk in the morning.
First thing.
You were lying your ass off.
Go to the hospital and get your shoulder looked at.
Excuse me, sir.
Could you do me a favour, sir?
- Your favours are all used up.
- I understand.
I just hoped you could call lnspector Todd and straighten things out for me, but that' s all right.
I' m out of a job.
It' s cool.
I think I' il stay in Beverly Hills.
I' m going to start a private investigation company.
I' il talk to Todd first thing.
- Really?
- You bet.
Thank you so much.
Hi, I' m Axel Foley checking out of suite 1035.
One moment, sir.
I' il get your bill.
Guys, you didn' t have to come to see me off, but I' m very moved.
Bogomil ordered us to make sure you got out of town.
That doesn' t matter.
What matters is that you came down here.
I' m all choked up.
I' ve got a lump in my throat.
Look a little misty yourself, Taggart.
- There you go, sir.
- Thank you.
Excuse me, the Beverly Hills Police Department is picking that up.
Get outta here.
Guys, that' s the last straw.
You guys are too nice.
Do you sell those Beverly Palm robes?
- Yes, sir. $95 apiece.
- Put them on my tab.
I have to have two of them, though.
Billy, you saved my life.
I want you to have this fine Beverly Palm robe.
Each time you get in the shower, think about our friendship.
Think about Axel Foley.
I love you, Billy.
Thanks, Axel.
Here, let me take this.
You should rest that arm.
Billy, take care of the tab.
- Taggart...
- Here you are, sir.
This is for you.
No, that' s all right.
You keep it as a souvenir.
I already have three of them in my bag.
Thank you, sir.
Not going to say goodbye?
Aren' t you tailing me to the city limits?
- Yes, we are.
- I figured you would.
I was thinking about stopping for a drink.
- We figured you would.
- Then will you join me?
I don' t think so, Axel.
We' re still on duty.
I don' t think one beer' s going to kill us, Billy.
Listen to Taggart.
Lighten up.
One drink' s not going to kill us.
But guys, if you fall too far behind, don' t be afraid to honk, OK?
- Where we going, anyway?
- Don' t worry, just follow my lead.
I know the perfect place.
Trust me.
English
- Come on!
We made a deal.
- I know, but it' s extremely crazy.
It' s mentally irregular, but it makes all the sense in the world.
- You owe me a favour.
- I know, but...
- When did you think of this?
- About three years ago.
- This is very crazy, Apollo.
- Stallion, when you won that last fight, you won by one second.
You beat me by one second.
That' s very hard for a man of my intelligence to handle.
Didn' t you say you learned how to live with it?
- I lied.
- Oh, you lied?
Oh!
So now you just gotta prove it to yourself, right?
Just for myself.
No TV, no newspapers - just you and me.
Nothin '- just you and me.
Age before beauty.
- Anything you say.
- I do all the work.
I tell you, Apollo, you' d better go slow.
You ain' t as young as springtime no more.
- Oh, yeah?
How you gonna do that?
- You taught me everything you know.
- Almost everything.
You gotta remember: you fight great, but I' m a great fighter.
You ready?
- Absolutely.
- You know, Stallion, it' s too bad we gotta get old, huh?
Oh, just keep punchin ', Apollo.
- Wanna ring the bell?
- All right.
Ding, ding.
Come on, Stallion.
Come on, come on.
Boy, you really move good for an older guy.
- Look at him fly.
- Look out now.
No, you don' t want any of this.
- Come on.
- Maybe I' m in here with the wrong guy.
Dad, you' re late.
Mom' s gonna yell at you.
- So how you doin '?
- Fine.
You know, don' t you think that' s a little bright?
- A little bit?
- Where' d you get that hat?
- A friend gave it to me.
- Who punched you in the eye?
- Same friend.
- That' s weird.
Better hurry, Dad.
You know, you' re developin 'a very, very loud personality.
Don' t go too fast, or you' re gonna get out of focus.
Oh, really?
- Yo!
- Yo.
It' s about time.
I' m sorry I' m late.
- Why don' t you go and get ready to eat?
- Great.
You' re here.
- Now you can stop calling him names.
- You been callin 'me names?
We wait any longer, it' il be my next birthday.
- Where have you been?
- Oh, gettin 'punched.
Bring the cake in and we can get this celebration under way.
- Boy, am I hungry.
- Baby, why don' t you get the cake?
We got a great surprise.
You' re gonna love this cake.
- And your present.
- Where is it?
Let me set the mood.
I gotta turn the lights down and everythin '.
- Watch this.
- Is it parked outside?
Just be patient, would ya?
I' m so excited, I' m startin 'to sweat.
I feel like I' m gettin 'ready to go into a big fight or somethin'.
Watch this.
Happy birthday, Paulie.
- What the hell is this?
- Your present.
I wanted a sports car for my birthday, not no walkin 'trash can!
- Come on!
He looks great.
- This is extremely psycho.
You have no friends, so we thought you' d like it.
Pretend you' re happy.
It' il keep you company.
- That' s a great- lookin 'guy.
- Please make a wish.
It' s creepy!
It talks!
Creepy?
I wish I had one of these when I was growin 'up.
- Go on, make a wish, like he says.
- I wish I wasn' t in this nightmare.
Very classy wish.
What do you think?
Very good, huh?
You wanna help me put out this forest fire?
- Sure.
- OK.
On the count of three.
One... two... three!
- Well, they' re out.
- You "drownded" me!
Oh, don' t worry.
I' il clean it up for you, Paulie.
- Rocky!
- Yeah, you noticed.
What are you doing with that cake?
The party ain' t over yet, you know.
We still gotta celebrate some more.
- It' s a special night.
- Yeah, it' s Wednesday.
It' s Wednesday, but in case you forgot, it' s almost been nine years since you' ve been married to me, so... here' s your prize.
- But our anniversary' s a week away.
- That' s true, but... why wait?
- Has it been that rough?
- No, no.
I tell you, it' s been excellent.
Open your prize.
Go on.
- Go on, open your prize.
- OK.
- Do you like it?
- It' s beautiful.
All right!
I was so nervous.
I didn' t know.
I hope you like it.
The guy I bought it from says even if it looks like a snake, don' t worry, cos it won' t bite you.
It' s beautiful.
You know what' s amazing?
That after all these years, everything still seems kinda new.
You remember a long time ago I told you that...
I said that you ain' t never gettin 'rid of me.
Remember that?
Well, you' re not.
You' re never gettin 'rid of me.
Happy "almost anniversary".
- A few questions, please.
- How long are you here for?
- We talk later.
- When are you gonna fight, Drago?
We talk later.
Is it definite that the Soviet Union will enter professional boxing?
No more talk now.
We will talk at press conference.
Today may be a landmark in sports history.
After unravelling years ofred tape, Russia will throw its hat into the ring - the prize ring.
The introductions were made by his wife, Ludmilla Vobet Drago - gold medallist in swimming.
Today the Soviet Union has officially entered professional boxing.
Captain lvan Drago, has come here with his trainers to America to compete as an international sportsman and ambassador ofgoodwill.
Has he boxed against a professional?
From having been trained in Russia by great boxing coach Manuel Vega, and now by Sergei Rimsky, we hope he' s qualified to do so.
- Hope?
- Well, I know he is, but I don' t want to sound too confident.
We would like an exhibition bout with your famous champion, Rocky Balboa.
You think he can fight someone as seasoned as Balboa?
There is no one who can match his strength, endurance or aggressiveness.
You make him sound indestructible.
Yes, he is.
Can this mammoth Russian, nicknamed the Siberian Express, wreak havoc among the professional heavyweight ranks?
Whoever he fights first, it' il be one hot ticket.
We' il be right back with a check on today' s pro football sports scoreboard.
Dad, when can I learn to fight?
- I can' t hear you.
- I wanna learn to fight.
Yo.
Could you turn your robot down?
You see, I fight so you don' t have to fight.
I want you to use your head for somethin 'instead of a punchin' bag, like I do.
Your head doesn' t look like a punching bag.
No?
That' s nice.
Thanks a lot.
Oh!
A wise guy, huh?
Mr Balboa!
Mr Creed' s on the phone.
- Yeah?
I' il be right there.
- You can get it right here.
- I hope it' s not another rematch.
- Oh, don' t worry about it.
Hello?
Yeah, Apollo...
Turn that down.
Apollo, how ya doin '?
Yeah?
You' re comin 'out?
That' s great.
What am I doin '?
I' m just gettin 'dizzy.
My husband and I thank you for coming to our training quarter today.
As you can see, it is highly advanced, and we wish to show the American press a small portion of the advances our country has made in the technology of human performance.
Coach Rimsky, what does this do to enhance performance?
- Well...
- If I may answer.
It makes a man a better man, a great athlete a superathlete, by harnessing all his strength.
- we wish to... educate your country.
- There have been rumours of doping, and widespread distribution of anabolic steroids in the Soviet Union.
- Has Drago partaken in any experiments?
- No! lvan is naturally trained.
Then how do you explain his... freakish strength?
Like your Popeye, he ate his spinach every day.
- Shall we have a demonstration?
- Please do.
A normal heavyweight averages 700 pounds of pressure per square inch.
As you can see, Drago averages 1850 pounds.
- So the result' s quite obvious.
- And what results are those?
Whatever he hits, he destroys.
I' ve seen Drago fight when he was an amateur.
He' s big and strong, but clumsy.
I know I can beat him.
- Why do you wanna fight again?
- Let' s just say it' s somethin 'I believe in.
- You can do your homework.
- OK.
Later, Dad.
Later, Uncle Paulie.
- Later, Apollo.
- Later, big man.
See you later, kiddo.
Don' t you think people are expectin '
- to see Rocky whack this bum out first?
- Yeah.
And he will, when it' s for real.
- This is an exhibition bout.
Kids' stuff.
- What' s the purpose?
What at this point in your life is worth getting hurt for?
- What the hell is that?
- That' s my girl.
- Thanks, honey.
- You' re welcome.
- That' s a nice song.
- It' s my favourite.
You' re the greatest.
See you, sport.
- See you.
- Paulie, who taught it to talk like that?
She loves me.
They try every other way.
With Rock' s help, we can get great media coverage.
We make them look bad.
- I think it' s wrong.
It' s never been more right.
You' re a great fighter, but you' ve been retired five years.
Isn' t it time to start thinking about something else?
How much can you take?
Either of you?
I' il... get the coffee.
Look, I' m sorry.
I didn' t mean to...
I just care about you both.
I...
You ever try these comics?
- No, no.
- Keeps your fertility.
Hey, Paulie.
In the ring now...
Rocky' s holding that right hand.
He' s fighting right- handed!
Oh, now this was a great fight.
Great!
I' m gettin 'punchy just watchin' it!
What you usin 'for a chin there, Stallion?
- I should' ve slipped that one.
- You definitely should' ve slipped that.
It' s crazy how people just care about you in that ring and when you' re bleedin ', but once you step out, you' re ancient history.
It ain' t ancient history.
I don' t see anybody askin 'for autographs, do you?
Hey, Apollo...
Can I... ask you somethin '?
What?
Well, this fight you' re havin 'against the Russian.
Do you think maybe... it ain' t against him?
If it' s not him, Stallion, then who' s it against?
Well, do you think maybe it' s, like... you against you?
What do you think?
You know, I think you really are gettin 'brain- damaged.
Maybe, but... really.
I' m speakin 'the truth here, Apollo.
- Are you?
- Yeah.
- I don' t think I wanna hear this, Stallion.
- Hey, Apollo, you were a great fighter, but, look, we gotta face the facts too.
You don' t wanna believe it, but maybe the show is over.
That' s easy for you to say.
You' re still on top.
What happens when you' re not on top?
Then what?
Where do we go, Stallion?
Cos we sure as hell can' t be born again.
I know we can' t be born again, but, let' s face it, we... we gotta change sometime.
I don' t wanna change!
I like who I am!
I like who you are, too, but look at that.
That ain' t us up there no more, Apollo.
We can' t do that the way we did it before.
We' re changin '.
We' re, like, turnin 'into regular people.
No, Stallion!
Maybe you think you' re changin '.
But you can' t change what you really are.
You can forget all this money and stuff.
Cos it don' t change a thing.
You and me, we don' t even have a choice.
We' re born with a killer instinct that you can' t just turn off and on like some radio.
We have to be right in the middle of the action, cos we' re the warriors.
Without some challenge, some damn war to fight, then the warrior may as well be dead, Stallion.
So I' m askin 'you, as a friend,
stand by my side this one last time.
You' re a great talker, Apollo.
All right, but... when this is over...?
You know me, Stallion.
I always think of somethin 'else.
That' s what I' m afraid of.
All right.
You got a deal there.
I feel sorry for that guy, you know?
What made you decide to put on an exhibition fight with Drago?
Let' s call it a sense of responsibility.
Responsibility, how?
I had to teach this young fella to box - American style!
Isn' t Drago a little inexperienced to be in the same ring?
Well, you know, some folks got to learn the hard way!
- No quick knockout predictions?
I' m not angry with him.
I just wanna show the whole world that Russia doesn' t have all the best athletes.
Rocky, how do you think Apollo should fight Drago?
Well, personally, I think the first thing you' d better get Apollo is a ladder.
Drago, how does it feel to spar with the great former champion?
The man' s tongue didn' t come through customs.
My husband is very happy to have this opportunity.
- It' s his dream.
- Dream?
How do you mean?
In our country, Apollo Creed is well known and very respected.
- It could be a good victory.
- Whoa!
Wait a minute, now.
Hold it.
When?
Now you don' t really think you' re gonna whip me, do ya?
- Well, he didn' t come here to lose.
- You hold on, little lady.
- Lose, and lose royally, he' s gonna do.
- How can you be so sure?
I' ve been with the best.
I beat the best.
I retired more men than Social Security!
Excuse, please.
You are not very realistic, are you, Mr Creed?
What are you talkin 'about?
You can box, yes, but you are far too old to think you can win over Drago.
- Is that a fact?
- Yes!
And it could be a painful one!
Put that heavy bag with eyeballs in the ring with me and you' il see pain!
- Why do you insult us?
- Now you just hold on here.
I' m not the bad guy.
I came to talk about a friendly exhibition bout
- It is you who are the aggressor.
I wish to say to the press, in all fairness,
Drago should not even fight this man, because he is a has- been.
You get that big chump in the ring right now...
- Stop this before you get hurt.
- I don' t wanna hear!
Let that chump go!
All right, all right.
I' ve said what I feel.
- We' il finish this in the ring!
- Wherever you like.
You shut up, and all these puppets you brought with you!
You' re history, chump!
- How did I do?
- A little loud for me.
- But good?
- Oh, yeah.
Very good.
East meets West.
Age versus youth in a goodwill exhibition match, as the former champion Apollo Creed takes on a mountain ofmuscle from the Soviet Union.: lvan Drago.
- Come on.
- Patience is a virtue.
- I' m ready to rock 'n' roll.
- You gotta get your equipment.
- Now you look like a mummy.
- I feel like a mummy.
- How does it feel?
OK?
- Feels great.
I feel like I could eat nails.
- I never tried them snails.
- What are you talkin 'about?
Snails.
I never had 'em.
I see 'em in the garden, but I never want to eat' em.
I didn' t say anythin 'about snails.
I said nails.
N- N- Nails, Stallion!
You look pretty good, but, you know, just do me a favour when you go up there.
- Try not to wear yourself out, OK?
- Yeah, wear myself out.
Sure.
Well, it' s just that you ain' t been in the ring for five years.
- I just want you to... maintain a little bit.
- I' m in the best shape of my life.
- I' m stronger, I' m quicker...
- Hey, I' m not sayin 'you' re not ready, but personally, if it were me,
I wouldn' t mind postponin 'a couple of weeks.
Postpone?
Come on, Apollo.
We don' t know anythin 'about this guy you' re fightin', really.
Let' s say I postpone.
I pull out, somebody else steps in and whips this chump.
- Then where does that leave me?
- This is just some kind of exhibition fight.
- This thing don' t mean nothin '.
- No, man.
That' s where you' re wrong.
This is not just an exhibition fight that doesn' t mean anything.
This is us against them.
What are you talkin 'about?
Come on!
Stallion...
Maybe you don' t know what I' m talkin 'about now, but you will when it' s over.
Believe me, you will when it' s over.
Ivan!
Good luck.
I hope after we can be friends.
- I hope so.
- Of course.
They' re sportsmen, not soldiers.
Enjoy the fight.
Good evening.
Along with Warner Wolf, I am Stu Nahan.
We welcome you to an unusual event: for the first time ever,
West against East in professional sports.
Thanks for gettin 'me here.
I owe you one.
- Oh, no, no.
- God, I feel born again.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome!
I would like to announce the presence of a true fighting champion that defines the word "courage".
The ltalian Stallion:
Rocky Balboa!
- Excuse me, would you?
- Certainly.
Rocky!
Tonight' s special event features two great athletes.
In the blue corner, weighing 221 pounds, a former heavyweight champion of the world, the Dancing Destroyer, the King of Sting, the Count of Monte Fisto...
- Think you got enough names?
- Be patient.
Almost done.
The Master of Disaster, the one and only Apollo Creed!
The crowd anticipating a great fight now as Apollo plays to the crowd.
In the red corner, weighing an even 261 pounds, gold medallist and undefeated world amateur champion from the Soviet Union, the Siberian Bull,
Ivan Drago!
I want you!
I want you!
I want you!
The two fighters come to the centre for instructions from referee Lou Filippo.
You know the rules.
Watch the low blows, kidney punches and rabbit punches.
In case of a knockdown, go to the corner and stay there until I tell you to come out.
- Shake hands.
Let' s have a good fight.
- It' s time to go to school, son.
Get your hands up!
Do you need an interpreter?
It' s time to go to school!
You will lose.
All right!
The bad blood between these two can be felt all over this arena.
I can' t get over the size of this Russian!
- Apollo!
Apollo!
- Get ready, cos it' s showtime!
Showtime!
- It' s showtime!
- Excuse me.
Didn' t you forget somethin '?
Apollo seems to be in great spirits.
He' s really putting on a show for this capacity crowd.
Be back in a minute, all right?
Round one.
Creed' s dancing around.
Creed back- pedalling now.
He' s been away five years.
Neither fighter ready to throw a punch.
A left jab there... and once again.
- A slip by Creed.
- This is bizarre.
Creed is over the hill, and... the Russian hasn' t fought anybody.
- Keep movin '.
Stick him!
- Drago' s moving in again.
A left hand by Creed.
Another left hand by Creed, and Drago moves away.
Another left hand by Creed.
Drago waiting, waiting, cocking that right hand.
A punishing right by the Russian.
Get outta there!
Get outta there!
A left.
He' s taking some punishment now.
Drago moves him against the ropes.
Tie him up now!
The Russian ties him up and throws Creed across the ring!
Move!
It is Drago with the upper hand now.
Get outta that corner!
Another right!
Another right!
Creed is against the ropes!
I think they may stop it.
What are you guys doin '?!
This is supposed to be an exhibition!
Tremendous end to the first round by the Russian, and a very bloody Apollo Creed.
The Soviet' s strength is incredible!
Champ, look.
I gotta stop ya.
This fight' s finished.
I gotta call it.
- You can' t do no more.
- I' m here to fight him.
- He' s killin 'ya!
I gotta stop this thing.
- Promise me you' re not gonna stop it.
That was a pulverising round for the ex- champion.
Hey, folks.
Ivan Drago is definitely for real.
You don' t stop this fight, no matter what.
No matter what.
Creed now comes out for round two dancing around.
The legs appear to be still a little rubbery.
Get your hands up.
And now it is the Russian just standing there, trying to intimidate Creed.
And the Russian throws a right hand to the jaw!
Another right to the head!
Creed' s being pounded without mercy!
Stop the fight!
- The referee is thrown across the ring!
- Throw the towel!
Throw the towel!
- I' ve never seen Apollo take so much.
- Throw the damn towel!
No!
- My God!
- Creed is down!
Apollo is down, and he could be badly hurt.
- Get these guys outta here.
- The winner, lvan Drago.
- Let me through!
Apollo!
- I cannot be defeated.
- Is he OK?
- Somebody get a doctor in here!
- There is no movement by Creed.
- I defeat old man.
- Is he dead?
- Get outta here!
It' s absolute pandemonium!
Will ya let him breathe?
Soon...
I defeat real champion.
Where' s the stretcher?
Let him breathe, for God' s sake!
What started out as a joke has turned out to be a disaster.
Creed is in a very serious condition.
- Is the man alive?
- You can make it, Apollo.
If he dies... he dies.
There' s a lot I could say... about this man.
But I don' t know if it matters now.
I guess what matters is... what he stood for, what he lived for, and... what he died for.
You always did everything... the way you wanted it.
I know I didn' t understand that, but...
now I understand.
I' il never forget you, Apollo.
You' re the best.
- Rocky, is the decision final?
- Yes.
Is this the first time the champion has given up his crown?
- I don' t know about that.
- Doesn' t the title matter?
Not until this is over.
Considering Rocky' s punching power, do you still expect an easy fight?
- Yes, of course.
- It' s a matter of size... and evolution.
Isn' t it, gentlemen?
Drago is the most perfectly trained athlete ever.
This other man has not the size, or the endurance, or the genetics to win.
It' s physically impossible for this little man to win.
Drago is a look at the future.
Champ, how much are you making for this fight?
- No money.
It' s not about money.
- Has the fight date been set yet?
- December 25th.
- Why Christmas?
- That' s what I was told.
- Where?
- It' s in Russia.
- Are you nuts?
Rocky, what' s going on?
We fight in Soviet Union, or we fight nowhere.
Why don' t you ask Drago' s wife why she is afraid?
Tell them, please.
I' m afraid for my husband' s life.
We have threats of violence everywhere.
We are not in politics.
All I want is for my husband to be safe, to be treated fairly.
You call him a killer.
He' s a professional fighter, not a killer.
You have this belief that you are better than us, that this country is so very good, and we are so very bad.
You have this belief that you are so fair, and we are so very cruel.
It is lies and false propaganda to support this antagonistic and violent government!
Violent?
We don' t keep our people behind a wall with machine guns!
- Who are you?
- Who am l?
- I' m... the unsilent majority, bigmouth!
Yes, good!
Insult us! ls more typical rude behaviour towards visiting foreigners!
But perhaps this simple defeat of this little so- called champion will be a perfect example of how pathetically weak your society has become.
We go!
- How do you feel about Russia?
- Is your husband going to Moscow?
How does it feel to be part of such a controversial decision?
Did Creed' s death make up your husband' s mind?
- I don' t know what you' re talking about!
- Why is he going at Christmas?
When will you be going to Russia?
I' m not going to Russia.
I don' t know what you' re talking about!
I don' t know what you people are doing here!
- Rocky?
- Yeah?
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Fine.
Why' d you do it?
- I just gotta do what I gotta do.
- You don' t have to do anything.
No, Adrian, I do, and...
I gotta leave this place, too.
So where are you... going?
They said they were gonna let me train in Russia.
I just wanna go someplace where I ain' t gonna think about nothin 'except him.
Rocky, give it some time.
Don' t do this.
A lot of people live with hurt.
A lot of people don' t have a choice.
And for that you' re willing to lose everything?
Adrian, this ain' t everything.
This house, and the cars, and all the stuff we got... that ain' t everything.
There' s a lot more than this, Adrian.
Before, there were reasons to fight I understood, but I don' t understand this.
Even if you win, what have you won?
Apollo' s still gone.
Why can' t you change your thinking?
Everybody else does!
Cos I' m a fighter!
That' s the way I' m made, Adrian.
That' s what you married.
We can' t change what we are.
- Yes, you can.
- You can' t change anythin '.
- All we can do is go with what we are.
- You can' t go with what you are!
Have you read the papers?
Do you know what everybody says?
It' s suicide!
You' ve seen him.
You know how strong he is.
You can' t win!
Oh, Adrian.
Adrian always tells the truth.
No, maybe I can' t win.
Maybe the only thing I can do... is just take everythin 'he' s got.
But to beat me... he' s gonna have to kill me.
And to kill me, he' s gonna have to have the heart to stand in front of me.
And to do that, he' s gotta be willin 'to die himself.
And I don' t know if he' s ready to do that.
I don' t know.
Be careful with those plaid ones.
They belong to the boss.
Paulie, did you pack your toothbrush?
You know how tobacco stains your teeth.
- Ifl' ve told you once, I' ve told you...
- Hey!
Hey!
- Stop bustin 'my chops.
- Paulie!
I' m gonna have her wires tied when I get back.
When will you be back?
- Oh, pretty soon.
- Are you scared?
- Nah.
- Yes, you are.
A little, maybe?
Well, wouldn' t you be?
If a big giant man wanted to beat me up, I' d be real scared.
Well, the truth is, you know, sometimes...
I do get a little scared, you know.
When I' m in that ring and I' m really gettin 'hit on, and my arms hurt so much I can' t even lift them, and I' m thinkin',
"God!
I wish this guy would hit me on the chin so I don' t feel nothin 'any more. "
Then there' s another side that comes out that isn' t so scared.
There' s another side that, like, wants to take more, that wants to go that one more round, because by goin 'that one more round when you don' t think you can, that' s what makes all the difference in your life.
And will you remember one more thing?
Daddy thinks you' re the best boy in the world, hm?
And that Daddy loves you... no matter what?
Will you?
I gotta go now.
- You gonna take care of everythin '?
And don' t forget to feed your robot.
Bye, baby.
Good luck.
Thanks.
Come on!
The meter' s runnin '!
What a horrendous flight.
This is Russia?
It don' t look so tough, Rock.
Mr Balboa.
We take you to quarters now.
Hey, when does the sun come up?
This is detrimental to my sinuses.
Weather changes, hour to hour.
Get used to it.
Get in car now.
We have very long trip.
He sounds like Dracula' s cousin.
Like you requested, yes?
- You requested this dumb location?
- Yeah.
Why?
You plannin 'to grow reindeer or somethin'?
- I just wanted to get away from things.
- The equipment you requested is in barn.
- Who are they?
- They?
They are assigned to you.
Official chaperons, yes?
Where you go, they go.
Oh, I have a bad dream here.
- OK?
This is below human standards.
There' s no antennas.
You gotta complain.
We' il crack out here!
You have everything I have been instructed to provide.
We are finished, yes?
Da svidaniya.
No sparrin '?
I don' t think I need it any more, Paulie.
No sparrin ', no TV, nothin'?
How the heck is he supposed to train around here?
No TV.
What about the Rose Bowl game?
No room service, I bet.
I hope they got my comics here.
What a depressing vacation.
Goddamn!
All right, you Chipmunks.
Ready to sing your song?
Checkmate, friend.
- Yeah?
- Hey, champ.
Can I come up?
Yeah, sure.
- How you doin '?
- Pretty good.
- Some kinda weather we' re havin ', huh?
- Yeah, it' s pretty rough.
But for what you gotta do, it' s good.
- Toughen you up.
- I guess so.
I know you' re gonna have to do almost everything alone, but I' il be with you.
Yeah, I know.
Apollo was like my son.
I raised him.
And when he died... a part of me died.
But now... you' re the one.
You' re the one that' s gonna keep his spirit alive.
You' re the one... that' s gonna make sure that he didn' t die for nothing.
Now you' re gonna have to go through hell, worse than any nightmare that you ever dreamed.
I know you' il be the one standin '.
I' il try.
I' il try.
You know what you gotta do.
Do it.
Do it!
Thanks, Duke.
I couldn' t stay away any more.
I missed you.
I missed you.
I' m with you, no matter what.
No matter what?
No matter what.
No pain.
No pain.
Drago!
Hello, and merry Christmas from a very unusual place.
We' re in Moscow.
I' m Barry Tompkins, along with AI Bandiero, and this promises to be the most watched event in boxing history.
The lron Horse from America, Rocky Balboa, comes here to the Soviet Union...
Ivan Drago: since that tragedy in Las Vegas and the death of Apollo Creed, he' s been re- nicknamed "Death from Above".
The general secretary of the Soviet and other members of the Politburo have now made their way to their seats high above the ring here in Moscow.
I know you' re kinda busy, but I wanna tell you some things I never told you.
I know sometimes I act stupid and I say stupid things, but you kept me around when other people would' ve said "Drop that bum." You give me respect.
It' s hard for me to say these kinda things because that ain' t my way, but if I could unzip myself and step out and be someone else, I' d wanna be you.
You' re all heart, Rock.
Thanks, Paulie.
Now blast this guy' s teeth out!
I' il try.
One of the fighters is starting to make his way through this crowd toward the ring.
- Listen to this crowd!
- This borders on pure hatred.
Rocky' s face: absolutely like stone, a picture of concentration, and the booing crowd here does not seem to bother him one bit.
The champ has a look that could burn through lead.
It seems the booing crowd has absolutely no effect on the man.
His concentration is like stone.
- That' s my dad.
- We know.
What do you think we are - nerds?
Listen to this crowd.
It sounds insane.
And now the entrance of the Russian national champion.
Ivan Drago, a man with an entire country in his corner.
Look at the expression on the face of lvan Drago.
He seems impervious to this madness of the crowd.
He' s like a volcano just waiting to erupt.
The Russian is cool as he acknowledges his premier.
I would like to point out again, this is a non- sanctioned fight.
This is not for the title.
The American Boxing Commission has not sanctioned it.
Ladies and gentlemen...
It' s unbelievable.
I have never seen such a hostile crowd.
Ivan Drago!
Roaring for their champion!
The two men are walking to the centre.
It' s an unbelievable sight to see.
They' re toe to toe.
The Russian towers above the American.
It' s a true case of David and Goliath here.
It' s unbelievable, the... the condition of both men.
I must break you.
Remember what I said about wanting to be you?
Forget it.
Thanks, Paul.
Take it straight to him, and be a rock for me, you understand?
Be a rock for me!
All right?
Take it to him!
No pain.
- No pain.
No pain.
- No pain.
No pain.
All right, Rock.
Do it!
There' s the bell.
Iike the Russian, way back into Balboa' s corner now.
- Get outta there!
- Let' s go, Rocky!
Balboa gets out of the corner, and it is Drago backing Rocky up with a jab.
And Balboa is not staying on balance because of the long jab of the Russian.
Brace yourself!
Brace yourself!
Hands up!
- Charge him!
- Now!
He can' t seem to touch the Russian.
Rocky pounding away, and he' s just hit him with everything he' s got.
And Drago just smiled at him.
- Keep choppin 'away!
- Chop him down!
Chop him down!
Rocky Balboa is in serious trouble!
They might have to stop this one before somebody gets killed.
Reach and grab him!
Reach and grab him!
Rocky woke the sleeping giant, and now he' s paying the price!
A right hand from Drago sends Rocky Balboa 1 5 feet across the ring, and the champ is down!
Come on!
Get up!
Hands up!
Hands up!
Drago continuing to punish Rocky.
He will not let him out of that corner, and Rocky Balboa is just trying to get through this first round.
The Russian just threw Rocky Balboa into his own corner like a rag doll.
What a tough three minutes for Rocky Balboa.
He' s not only fighting an invincible opponent, he' s also fighting a hostile crowd, and the Russian premier and most of the Politburo looking on.
- What' s happenin 'out there?
- He' s winnin '.
- I see three of him out there.
- Hit the one in the middle.
Hit the one in the middle!
- Yeah.
You' re not doing as you' re told.
The American is small and weak...
Weak.
Take his heart.
If you hurt him, you' il take his heart.
No pain!
Keep workin '!
Round two.
It' s been a one- sided fight so far.
It' il take more than luck for Rocky to survive this round.
Slip him a hook, Rock!
Slip him a hook!
Balboa trying to stay in the middle of the ring against the big Russian.
Do what you gotta do!
Stay with him!
For all intent, Balboa should be all finished, but he' s fighting back ferociously.
Rocky!
Balboa goes down again from a right hand!
Bounces right back up.
He' s gettin 'killed out there!
Rocky Balboa has taken lvan Drago' s best punches so far.
He' s cut and he' s bleeding, but he' s on his feet and he' s on the run!
- He' s cut!
He' s cut!
- The Russian' s cut!
And it' s a bad cut!
And now it' s Rocky Balboa coming after lvan Drago!
Incredible!
Get him!
Drago wants to go on!
He grabs Balboa by the throat!
Balboa picking up the Russian and throws him to the ground like a wrestler.
It' s a gutter war!
No holds barred in Moscow!
Rocky may be on the receiving end so far, but he' s here to fight.
This is shaping up to be a personal war, and right now it' s anybody' s boxing match.
You' re doin 'good, Rocko.
I couldn' t do better myself.
How can you do this?
He' s nothing... soft!!
You got him hurt bad.
Now he' s worried.
You cut him!
You hurt him!
You see?
You see?
He' s not a machine.
He' s a man!
He' s not human...
He' s like a piece of iron.
- You want it more than he does!
- No pain.
- No pain.
- No pain.
OK!
Take it to him!
Take it to him!
Take it to him!
Get up!
And a big right hand by Rocky Balboa!
You' re doin 'fine.
You' re doin 'great.
Come on!
A few cheers now for Rocky Balboa!
Suddenly Moscow is pro- Rocky!
No pain.
No pain.
Al, this place is ready to explode.
Lethal punch after punch.
Amazing willpower!
And Rocky' s determination is beginning to win over what was a hostile crowd.
This is incredible.
- What round is it?
One more round.
There' s no stoppin 'us now.
This is our round.
No stoppin 'now!
You start and you don' t stop!
All your strength!
All your power!
All your love!
Everythin 'you' ve got!
You trained this fool.
He' s a disgrace.
Listen to them...
Our people cheer for HlM!...
You idiot.
WlN!
I fight to win!
For me!
For me!
To win you gotta knock him out!
Punch and punch till you can' t punch no more!
- This is your whole life here!
- Yeah, knock him out, Rocko.
Do it now!
Now!
- There' s the bell.
The war is on.
- This is the last round.
To the end.
Which of these magnificent fighters will be standing at the end?
Drago snaps out a stiff jab.
And another.
Rocky taking punishment.
Trying to get inside.
He' s completely exhausted.
Come on, Rock!
What are you waitin 'for?!
Hit him!
Come on!
Fight!
Balboa is chopping the Russian down!
Rocky Balboa throwing punches at the Russian.
And Drago throws a hard right hand that stuns Rocky Balboa!
Don' t go down!
Don' t go down!
Forget technique, forget strategy.
This is a street fight.
Who wants it most?
- What is he doin '?!
- He' s winnin '!
To the body!
To the body!
Rocko, knock his head off!
You' re gonna do it!
Ivan!
Four!
Rocky Balboa has done the impossible!
And these people love him!
It is absolute pandemonium!
More than ever, Rocky has proven himself a true champion!
Thank you.
I came here tonight, and I didn' t know what to expect.
I guess I didn' t like you much none either.
I seen a lot of changin '.
The way... youse felt about me, and the way I felt... about you.
In here, there were two guys... killin 'each other, but I guess... that' s better than 20 million.
What I' m tryin 'to say is... that if I can change... and you can change, everybody can change!
Excuse me!
I just wanna say one thing to my kid, who should be home sleepin '.
Merry Christmas, kid!
I love you!
- You got a $50 bill?
- When do I get it back?
Man, give me $50!
It' s all I got.
This is part of a $50 bill like Billy' s with the hidden barcode.
Happens all the time.
No, the barcode' s going up, so it comes off this corner.
lf it comes off this corner it should have ink on it.
It' s too big to be blank.
It' s Oki- Doki!
Don' t let your brother get away.
I got to load my camera.
Oki- Doki!
Nice little kid.
How you doing?
Good to see you.
- I love you, Oki- Doki!
- Oki, do the Oki Shuffle.
It' s like this.
Listen, I changed the steps.
You got a problem with that?
You' re supposed to be nice, no matter what!
You little motherfucker...
Grandma!
Oki- Doki pushed me!
You take it already.
You playing or what?
Who ate garlic?
When' s lunch?
I want a pastrami on rye.
See that move, Rufus Rabbit?
- Axel?
- What?
Coffee.
Would you like some coffee?
Louis, how' s it going?
- Fine, fine.
- Say hi to lrene.
- Will do.
- Louis?
Follow me.
I wouldn' t mind giving her a massage.
When DeWald took over he stuck me down here on what he calls park safety watch.
I can still access most of what' s in the mainframe.
- ls this the tunnel system?
- Yes.
Do any of these tunnels lead to somewhere only DeWald' s boys can go?
No.
All park accesses are unrestricted to park personnel.
That' s being redone.
Show me the Happy Forest.
That would be right here at the end of corridor B.
It' s right after...
It' s right after...
- How long' s it been closed?
- Too long.
I' m talking about the Happy Forest ride?
The Forest.
Yes, about a couple of weeks.
It wasn' t very popular so they' re trying some new ideas.
I think they found one.
Can I have this?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
There you go.
You know... when this thing is over...
Would you like to get together and have some dinner or something?
- That would be nice.
- Can you put that in here?
Sure.
There you go.
- We have a date.
- A date.
Can you help me with this?
There you go.
Remember, an elephant never forgets.
All right.
- Louis, how goes it?
Nice to see you.
- Say hello to lrene.
See you.
Everything on schedule?
I had to tweak the image a little bit, but it' s under control now.
Foley' s up there.
Get him!
Will the DeWald family please come to Tiny Town?
The DeWald family to Tiny Town.
But, honey, the Happy Forest is closed.
OK, I' il meet you at the main gate at 5: 00.
- I' m sorry.
- You' re sorry?
This is Detective Axel Foley.
I' d like to speak with Agent Fulbright.
Could you patch me into his radio?
It' s an emergency.
Fulbright, Foley.
I found what you' re looking for.
I' m at Wonder World.
Get out here now!
Get me 91 1.
All cars in the vicinity of Wonder World.
Proceed there immediately.
10- 19, 10- 45, and 12- 22 in progress.
Why am I not surprised?
All right, don' t shoot!
I' il put my gun down.
I put my gun on the ground, and I' m unarmed.
Don' t shoot.
This is great.
You caught him.
Good.
He broke into a security area.
Save that shit for new talent night at San Quentin.
- I' m on to your operation.
- My operation?
God damn it, Axel, what have you done now?
There are hundreds of children around.
- They don' t give Oscars in prison.
- Fuck you!
There' s someone here from...
Fulbright, Secret Service.
- I put you on a plane to Detroit.
- You' re gonna be glad I stayed.
I know what you' re investigating.
It' s right here.
And what am I investigating?
Paper, US Mint quality.
That' s what was in that truck.
You wanted to follow the truck back to LA to find his print shop.
- It' s right here in Wonder World.
- What is he raving on about?
- ln Wonder World?
This place is as high- tech as NASA and Nintendo combined.
They got a hidden room under this closed ride.
That' s why they were chasing me.
My men were pursuing Mr Foley because he' s delusionary and potentially dangerous.
This room, delusionary also?
No.
There is a closed ride, which we use to...
- I' d better take a look at it.
- Maybe we' d better look at it.
Counterfeit bills, out of this machine.
- ls this true?
- 'Fraid so, officer.
'Fraid we' ve been caught red- handed, right, Ellis?
'Fraid so.
Would you like to see them?
First quality.
Make a run, Donald.
We call them Wonder World dollars.
Redeemable for admission, rides, souvenirs.
It' s our big Christmas promotion.
We' re giving it away to elementary schools across the country.
You must be in on this.
You supply equipment, he supplies paper, right?
They changed it to this shit after I left.
- After we leave they' il put it back.
- What' s this paper?
- Ordinary rag.
- They switched it.
I am tired of these accusations, officers.
I want this man arrested for public endangerment.
Could I speak with you a moment?
God damn it, we spent a fucking year with our noses up DeWald' s ass!
We' re this close to locking this up, and you piss all over us!
Our case is blown.
You' re going back to Detroit, and if you weren' t a cop,
I' d have you doing dead time in Leavenworth for life.
Detective Flint, he' s yours.
Let' s go, Axel.
Make sure he doesn' t get on the plane.
I got a wife, three kids, a mortgage and a pension that won' t cut it.
That job at Wonder World is my retirement plan.
We' re being followed.
It' s the security guards at Wonder World.
They probably want to make sure you get on that plane.
Because of you, my future is in real fucking jeopardy.
DeWald is pissed.
Sanderson won' t think too highly of me.
Hold up!
Stop the car!
Stop!
- What?
- Oh, shit!
- Wait!
It' s all right.
Don' t worry.
When I do, I' il kill him!
Axel, I left as soon as I got your call.
Are you OK?
I' m fine, but I want you to think back to the night Fry disappeared.
- Maybe you forgot something.
Why would you think that?
Because this note by itself... it just don' t make no sense.
Life and death. "
Why would he even send that?
Not "help, I need to talk to you," nothing.
Just this.
Oh, shit.
Fry must have found some sample paper.
He knew they' d kill him so he sent it to you.
- There' s a barcode.
- What does that mean?
It used to belong to Uncle Sam.
We can put Sanderson and DeWald' s ass in jail.
I don' t think so.
I figured you' d call Uncle Dave here, so we followed him.
I actually was a real cop once so I know how you assholes think, which is to say, slowly.
Very slowly.
So you were carrying the evidence the whole time, Sherlock?
Here' s the real ending of the story.
Let' s see if you like it.
We heard you were loose.
You had a grudge against the park.
I feared you might try to harm our beloved Uncle Dave, so I raced over here as fast as I could to try and stop you, but alas, it was too late.
Get him all the way in the car.
Take it.
Take it.
You worried about fingerprints?
Look at the gun.
It' s yours.
Give me your weapon.
Throw that gun in the street!
Close the door and get over there!
Damn it!
Don' t you die on me, man.
I got an emergency out here.
Come on!
That was Uncle Dave.
- Pressure?
- 90 over 40 and dropping.
I got to get his pressure up.
Let' s go, guys.
On three.
One, two, three.
Any medical history?
I' ve been shot before, but it' s no big deal.
- Where' s the coffee machine?
- Down the hall.
This is an all- city alert for a suspect in the Thornton shooting.
Suspect is an African- American male...
You hear some black guy shot Uncle Dave?
- No?
- Come on, let' s get out of here.
Did you hear?
Somebody shot Dave Thornton.
- Somebody shot Uncle Dave?
- ls there a TV here?
Yes, of course.
Authorities believe that Foley attacked Uncle Dave in retaliation for some personal rejection.
The much- loved Uncle Dave is undergoing surgery at this moment.
According to hospital sources, the prognosis is bleak.
How does a psycho like that live with himself?
Get out of the park.
They' re going to kill whoever knows about Roger Fry' s note.
Janice can' t come to the phone right now.
Can I take a message?
- lf you do anything...
- It' il be your fault.
I want you at Wonder World within the hour.
Come to the main gate alone and unarmed.
- And bring the Mint paper.
- Then you let us go?
lf you don' t show up here in a half- hour, alone, unarmed and with no cops, I kill your friend.
And it wouldn' t be the first time, would it?
We have an amateur video of the incident this afternoon involving Uncle Dave' s assassin, Axel Foley.
All right, don' t shoot.
I' m putting my gun down.
I' m not armed.
Don' t shoot.
That was an amateur video shot earlier today by a tourist.
Would you please take special care of my car?
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
- Shit!
- Ackwell...
Serge, I need a weapon.
I don' t have any weapon.
I take all back.
- What about this?
- This is the floor model.
People been breathing on it, coughing on it...
Serge, I need a weapon now.
Donny, Ackwell in some kind of rush, OK?
So take the Annihilator and wash it off with some cologne, and take the case and make sure it' s nice and pretty.
It' s Corinthian leather.
- Billy, Axel calling.
Am I your friend?
I' m sure you can explain, or maybe you can' t explain, but you' ve got to turn yourself in.
- I' m going to Wonder World.
- No!
Wait for me!
Axel!
Put your arms out and hold for a pat- down.
Foley just arrived, sir.
Take him to control.
We have Foley.
Come on.
- How much do you want run?
- All of it.
- Are you OK?
- Let' s have the paper.
There' s a Porsche by the front gate.
There' s a phone inside.
When she calls, I' il give you it.
- I don' t think so.
- Then we got a stalemate.
Not quite.
Orrin...
We kill you both.
The paper don' t mean jack shit.
How you know I didn' t mail it to the Secret Service?
- He' s bluffing.
Call me.
Orrin, I know how cops think.
The note is in the car.
The keys, Foley.
Give me the fucking keys.
- Drop that fucking gun!
- Again?
Drop it!
Axel, what are you doing here?
- What happened?
- It' s the coolant safety system.
Protects the mainframe in case of fire.
- We can' t.
Not from this side.
He' s trying to use an outside line.
Do something!
Hello, police?
Shit!
Foley' s loose in the park!
I repeat...
Foley' s loose in the park!
Get him!
Mr DeWald!
We gotta do something.
Call for help!
There' s just the modem line for the computers.
I got it!
Just let the computer dial...
That' s it.
What good would that be?
A lot of good.
We can call Flint' s pager.
Foley is in Hometown Square.
Repeat, Foley is in Hometown Square.
Foley is heading for Alien Attack.
Attention.
Aliens are invading the city.
Board the subway trains for immediate evacuation.
He ran up those stairs.
I need that right away!
Not again.
Excuse me.
Dispatch, this is Flint.
Trace that number that keeps calling me.
555- 4085.
It' s a computer line at the Wonder World theme park.
Call and tell them their computer' s broken.
We tried, but all the voice lines are down.
Must be that Uncle Dave shooting.
Somebody shot Uncle Dave?
- Some fool named Axel Foley.
Where the fuck is he?
Get to a phone and call the police.
I' il try and find Axel.
All right!
There you are.
Foley' s...
Name' s Wild Bill Rosewood.
I' m the sheriff of this town.
What the hell happened here?
Shit!
Damn it!
Turn that fucking song off!
You all right?
- Hello, Fulbright.
- You hurt bad?
Look, Foley, I guess I owe you an apology.
You were right.
I got Sanderson handcuffed in the car.
He was in on it, right?
I found out about another partner that was in on it.
So long, Foley.
You OK?
Any chance you can explain any of this to me?
Like why the fuck am I shot?
You guys OK?
- Are you OK?
- I' m fine.
I wonder what time the park opens.
He needs medical attention.
- Does this hurt?
- Don' t touch it.
I am so happy to introduce to you our new character in Wonder World, named after a man who' s most responsible for my being here today.
Axel Fox!
I don' t think you' ve seen the Tunnel of Love ride, have you?
I didn' t know y' all had a Tunnel of Love ride in Wonder World.
There will be shortly.
ENGLlSH
Can I persuade you to take a sandwich?
I' il get drive- through.
You' re counting on the Winged Avenger to deliver you from evil...... aren' t you, my friend?
Are you going to kill me?
Maybe, maybe not.
We' re of two minds on the subject.
Are you a gambling man?
Let' s say we flip for it?
One man is born a hero, his brother a coward.
Babies starve, politicians grow fat...... holy men are martyred, and junkies grow legion.
Why?
Luck!
Blind, stupid, simple, doo- dah...... clueless luck!
The random toss...... is the only true justice.
Let' s see what justice has in store...... for you.
It' s like the touch of God.
Wait, wait, wait.
Another day of wine and roses.
In your case, beer and pizza.
- But you said you' d let me live!
- Too true!
Nothing' s better than live bait to trap a bat.
Hot entrance.
Two guards are dead.
He' s holding a third hostage.
Didn' t see this one coming.
The Second Bank of Gotham...
Second anniversary of the day I captured him.
How could he resist?
I' m Chase Meridian.
I asked her to come here to consult on the case.
She specializes in...
Abnormal psychology, multiple personalities.
Insightful.
Naive, but insightful.
Not every girl makes a superhero' s night table.
Can we reason with him?
- It won' t do any good.
- He' il slaughter them without a thought.
- Agreed.
A trauma powerful enough to create an alternate personality leaves one...
In a world where normal rules of right and wrong no longer apply.
Like you.
I could write a hell of a paper on a man who dresses like a flying rodent.
Really?
I didn' t know that.
You are interesting.
And call me Chase.
By the way, do you have a first name, or do I call you Bats?
Let' s start this party with a bang!
Boys!
Kill the Bat!
Blast him!
Open sesame.
It' s a trap!
Attention citizens of fair Gotham!
Enough cash to rain down upon fair Gotham, a glorious flood of chaos.
And, of course...... you, my boy, dead!
It' s boiling acid!
For your dying pleasure, we are serving the acid that made us the men we are!
- Yes!
Yes!
- Give me your hand.
- Don' t let go!
I must borrow this.
That' s my hearing aid!
Thanks.
My shoes are melting!
No more!
Hang on?
Get him down.
Take it easy with him.
Just stay calm.
This' il fix him!
Hang on, Batty!
Let' s see.
Yes!
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
Farewell forever to that...... pointy- eared night rat!
Face!
Give it up.
Have the good taste to die!
See you!
Harvey Two- Face is still at large and extremely dangerous.
In other news today...... billionaire Bruce Wayne extended his profit- sharing program...... to the employees of the successful electronics branch of Wayne Enterprises.
Mr. Wayne.
Your inspections are a departmental highlight.
Oh, my God, it' s him.
I am a winner.
I am a winner.
Alternative fuel.
Mr. Wayne, look at that time.
Perhaps we should get to R & D as soon as possible.
Mister...?
Oh, Bruce Wayne.
No, that' s my name.
And you are?
Edward Nygma.
You hired me personally.
Just like I tell everyone.
We' ve never actually met, but your name was on the hiring slip.
I need that hand back.
Oh, yes, of course.
I' m sorry.
Back to work.
And some people have been trying to keep us apart.
Back to work.
What' s on your mind?
Precisely.
What' s on all our minds?
Brain waves.
The future...... of Wayne Enterprises...... is brain waves.
I must apologize, Mr. Wayne.
- It' s okay.
I have it!
My invention...... beams any TV signal directly into the human brain.
By stimulating neurons, manipulating brain waves...... this device makes the audience feel like they' re inside the show.
Why be brutalized by an uncaring world?
Did you say "manipulating brain waves"?
Yes.
But...... someone like you would never need it.
Someone so...... intelligent, witty and...... charming.
I need a bit of additional funding for human trials.
Now, listen...... I want a full set of technical schematics on this, okay?
Look at us!
Two of a kind!
She' il set something up.
That' s not...... going to be good for me.
I need an answer now.
I think I deserve it.
I' m sorry, then the answer is no.
Tampering with people' s brain waves...... mind manipulation...... it just raises too many questions.
Sorry.
The factory looks great.
Back to work!
We' il discuss this later!
You were supposed to understand.
I' il make you understand.
Lock.
Chair.
I saw the signal.
All is ready.
Commissioner?
He' s at home.
I sent the signal.
What' s wrong?
Last night at the bank I noticed something about Two- Face:
It' s his Achilles' heel.
It can be exploited.
I know.
You called me for this?
The Batsignal is not a beeper.
I wish I could say that my interest in you was...... purely professional.
Are you trying to get under my cape?
A girl can' t live by psychoses alone.
It' s the car, right?
Chicks love it.
What is it about the wrong kind of man?
In grade school: guys with earrings.
College: motorcycles, leather jackets.
Now...
... black rubber.
Less to take off.
I don' t mind the work.
Pity I can' t see behind the mask.
We all wear masks.
You read?
I don' t blend in at a family picnic.
We could give it a try.
I' il bring the wine...... you bring your scarred psyche.
Direct, aren' t you?
You like strong women.
I' ve done my homework.
Or do I need skintight vinyl and a whip?
I haven' t had much luck with women.
Maybe you just haven' t met the right woman.
I saw the signal.
- Nothing.
False alarm.
Are you sure?
Women.
Now I' ve got it!
There' s too many questions.
"Too many..."
I' il show you it works!
What the hell is going on here?
I told you this project is terminated!
I' m calling Security!
Caffeine will kill you!
Rise and shine, little guinea pig.
What are you doing?
Untie me!
This won' t hurt.
At least, I don' t think it will.
What are you doing?
This?
Losing resolution.
More power!
Edward Nygma...... come on down!
You' re the next contestant on...... Brain Drain!
I' il take what' s inside thick skull number one!
What have we got for him?
Oh, Stickley, I' m having a breakthrough!
Maybe!
Nevertheless, I' m smarter.
No, several geniuses.
A gaggle, a swarm...... a flock of freaking Freuds!
Riddle me this, Fred.
What is everything to someone...... and nothing to everyone else?
Your mind, baby!
Now mine pumps with the power of yours!
"I' m sucking up your IQ
"Vacuuming your cortex
"Feeding off your brain"
What a rush!
What the hell just happened?
A very surprising side effect.
While you were mesmerized by my 3- D TV...... I utilized your neural energy to grow smarter.
Bruce Wayne was right!
You demented, bizarre, unethical toad!
It is brain manipulation!
I' m reporting you to the FCC!
The AMl!
And the police!
You are going up on charges...... to court, to jail...... and then to a mental institution for the rest of your life!
But, first and foremost, Nygma, you are fired!
Fired!
I don' t think so.
Hang on!
You are fired!
Or should I say...... terminated?
Surf' s up, Big Kahuna!
He may have to settle for the Bronze.
"Questions," Mr. Wayne?
My work raises too many questions?
Why hasn' t anybody...... put you in your place?
Harvey Dent, once Gotham' s District Attorney...... was horribly scarred by underworld kingpin, Boss Moroni.
Although Batman tried to save him......
Dent' s left- brain damage turned him into a violent criminal...... who blamed Batman and who has vowed to destroy him.
Harvey Two- Face is extremely dangerous, repeat, extremely dangerous.
There' s been an accident at Wayne Enterprises.
Horrible way to die.
The surveillance cameras are down here.
We' il dredge the river, but with that current, I doubt we' il find the body.
Why?
Oh, why?
I just can' t believe it.
Two years working in the same office.
He was like my father...... my brother...... or a cousin that visits a lot.
Get a grip, Edward.
I found this in my cubicle.
You' il find the handwriting matches his, as does the sentence structure.
I couldn' t possibly continue on here.
The memories...
This is last night' s security log.
There' s Stickley.
Pretty cut and dry.
Yes, definitely suicide.
Thanks very much for your help, Bruce.
Stickley' s suicide doesn' t make sense.
I want full benefits for his family.
Suicide' s not covered by our corporate insurance policy.
Full benefits.
Who are you taking to the Charity Circus?
What' s this?
I don' t know.
I didn' t see anyone.
"If you look at the numbers on my face...
"... you won' t find 13 anyplace."
That' s hideous.
What does it mean?
It' s a riddle.
"Numbers on my face... 13."
One through twelve.
The answer is a clock.
Who would send you a riddle?
That, Maggie...... is the riddle.
Guess what I did today?
Wayne Manor.
See you soon.
Dr. Meridian, please.
Thank you.
I... guess I' m early.
I have an appointment.
I' m Bruce Wayne.
Then you can afford to buy me a new door.
I' m sorry.
You... sounded like you were in...
... you know, trouble.
I prefer healthy expressions of violence as opposed to breaking in.
So...... how can I help you?
Someone' s been sending me love letters.
One at my office and one at my home.
Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your opinion.
A clock.
"What once was red is black instead."
A match.
My opinion: this letter writer is a wacko.
"Wacko?"
Is that a technical term?
Patient may suffer from obsession...... with potential homicidal tendencies.
Is that better for you?
So, what you' re saying is...... this guy' s a total wacko.
Exactly.
His only escape may be to purge the fixation.
To kill me.
I think you understand obsession better than you let on.
You like bats?
That' s a Rorschach, Mr. Wayne.
An inkblot.
People see what they want.
The question is: do you like bats?
Still playing with dolls?
She' s a Malaysian dream warden.
Some cultures believe she protects you from bad dreams.
It' s silly to you, I' m sure.
You look so sad.
Me?
Why would I?
You' re not exactly what you seem, are you?
What is it you really came here for?
Yikes, time' s up.
That' s usually my line.
I' d love to stay here chatting...
Would you?
I' m not so sure.
I must get you out of those clothes.
Excuse me?
And into a black dress.
Tell me, Doctor, do you like the circus?
Ladies and gentlemen...... boys and girls of all ages...... welcome to the greatest show on earth!
Who is this beautiful young woman you' re with?
A doctor?
What kind of doctor?... for Gotham Children' s Hospital.
Let' s thank our largest single donor:
Bruce Wayne!
Ladies and gentlemen...... 70 feet above the ground...... performing feats of unimaginable aerial skill...... the Flying Graysons!
Would you like to join me?
I' d like to.
I really love it.
But?
I' ve met someone.
You just moved here.
You could say he just...... dropped out of the sky and...... bang!
I think he felt it too.
He sure did.
What?
Who wouldn' t?
Now......
Richard...... the youngest Flying Grayson...... will perform the awe- inspiring...... death drop...... without the safety...... of a net!
Let' s go.
You' il be okay.
Ladies...... and gentlemen!
Now, the new management of the circus invites you to forget...... this good, wholesome fun...... and join us in a celebration of absolute chaos...... and true jesters!
Bring it on!
Tonight, a new act for your...... personal amazement.
Let us direct your attention to the ring.
Inside this harmless- looking orb are two...... that' s two hundred sticks of TNT.
And in our innocent hand...... a radio detonator.
What do you want?
Want, Mr. Mayor?
Batman.
Bruised, broken, bleeding...... in a word: dead!
Who do we have before us?
Gotham' s finest...... well- to- do...... influential.
Surely one of you knows who Batman is.
Hell, odds are one of you pasty- faced twits is Batman!
You have two minutes.
Harvey!
I' m Batman!
Go out on the rigging.
Be careful.
Don' t worry.
Go to work, boys!
Our kind of day.
Reach for it!
Stop it!
Oh, my God.
He hasn' t anyone now.
He' s filled out papers all day.
Welcome, Master Grayson.
I' m Alfred.
How' re you doing, Al?
There' s a room prepared for you.
But perhaps you' d like to eat first.
Okay, I' m out of here.
Excuse me?
Telling that cop I' d stay here...... saved me a lot of social- service interviews.
See you.
Take it easy.
Where will you go?
The circus must be halfway to Metropolis.
Get a fix on Two- Face.
Then I' il kill him.
Killing Two- Face won' t take the pain away.
It' il make it worse.
Spare me the sermons, all right?
I don' t need your advice or your charity.
Nice bike.
Hang out at a lot of biker bars?
You' re almost on empty.
There' s no gas station for miles.
The pump' s over here.
Is this a garage or a car museum, Bruce?
That' s a 1917 Harley.
Indian Classic, fully restored.
This is a Vincent Black Knight.
They only made a hundred.
A hundred and one, actually.
You' ve got two.
The throttle sticks on this one.
Alfred' s a good mechanic, but...... these need a lot of work.
If someone were to fix them up...... they could keep one.
Anyway...... have a nice trip.
You' il land on your feet.
Is the young master leaving?
Pity.
I' il just toss this away then.
Hey, Al, wait up.
Master Bruce?
Just like my parents.
It' s happening again.
A monster comes out of the night, a scream, two shots.
I killed them.
What did you say?
He killed them.
Two- Face.
He slaughtered that boy' s parents.
No, no.
You said, "I killed them."
Take care of the kid.
Certainly, sir.
Can I help you settle in, Master Grayson?
Thanks, I won' t be staying long.
Is this a robin?
My brother' s wire broke once and I swung out and grabbed him.
My father said I was his hero.
I flew in like a robin.
Some hero I turned out to be.
But your father was right.
I can tell.
Throw this away, will you?
I won' t need it anymore.
I think I' il just put it in here.
Broken wings mend in time.
One day Robin will fly again.
I promise.
We' il drive.
The Puzzler?
The Gamester?
Captain Kill?
Question Mark Man?
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
The Bat' s stubborn refusal to expire...... is driving us insane!
Don' t worry, baby.
You' il kill him soon.
Besides...... I made your favorite:
Sparkling champagne and...... yummy poached salmon with little quail eggs and...... a creamy...... dreamy...... lemon soufflé.
A charred heart of black boar...... a side of raw donkey meat...... and a Sterno and grain alcohol, straight up, baby!
Ladies, you spoil us!
We' re of two minds about what to eat first.
What?
I hope you made extra.
Who the hell are you?
Just a friend.
But you can call me...... The Riddler.
I' il call you dead, is more like it!
How did you find us?
But then if I talked, what would keep you from slaying me, O Segregated One?
That' s never going to heal if you don' t stop picking.
Let' s see if you bleed green.
It' s not me you want to kill.
That' s just too easy for someone as powerful as you and...... you.
But Batman...... there' s a challenge.
Kill the Bat!
Sounds like a good idea.
But have you thought it through?
A few bullets, a splash of blood, then what?
Wet hands.
Post- homicidal depression.
Why not humiliate him first?
Then, when he is at his weakest...... crush him!
I see that...... sparkle in your left eye.
I can help you get Batman.
That is, if you' Il...... spare my life for just a few moments.
Thank you.
I love what you' ve done with this place.
Heavy Metal meets House and Garden.
Beautiful.
It' s so dark and Gothic and...... disgustingly decadent.
Yet so bright and chipper and...... conservative.
It' s so you!
And yet, so you!
Very few people are both a summer and a winter, but...... but you pull it off nicely.
What' s the point?
Has anyone ever told you, you have a serious impulse- control problem?
This is the point.
This is how I found you.
Let me demonstrate.
This is your brain on The Box.
This is my brain on The Box.
Does anyone else feel like a fried egg?
I' il have more.
But only the first one' s free.
You' il help me steal production capital...... so I can put a Box on every TV in town...... and become Gotham' s cleverest, carbon- based life form!
And in return...
Is everybody paying attention?
I will help you solve the greatest riddle of all.
The mother of all riddles:
Who is...... Batman?
You broke into our hideout.
You violated the sanctity of our lair.
We should crush your bones into powder.
But you pose an interesting proposition.
Therefore, heads: we accept, and tails: we blow your damn head off.
Here' s a good one.
There is a good one.
I' il attend to it.
- I' m not used to being waited on.
Don' t shoot me!
Don' t eyeball me!
Give me that!
Two- Face, show me how to punch a guy!
It' s dead simple, my boy.
Ball up your fist, reach back...... and assert yourself.
Let me try.
Ball up the fist, reach way back... assert yourself.
One hundred thousand, two hundred and twenty.
One hundred and...
I lost count!
Last night another robbery, perpetrated by the Green- Suited Menace...... resulting in millions in diamonds stolen, with no sign of Batman.
Teamed with Two- Face, this new criminal' s pattern...... of marking his crimes with puzzles has Gothamites calling him The Riddler.
Apparently, you and Batman have a common enemy.
That was with the morning mail.
"The eight of us go forth, not back.
"To protect our king from the foe' s attack."
Chess pawns.
Clock.
Matches.
All physical, man- made objects.
Small in size, light in weight.
What' s the connection?
With all due respect, that' s why they call him The Riddler.
May I help you?
Why is this the only locked door?
What' s back there?
Master Wayne' s dead wives.
On your way.
Now, you can be part of the action!
Nygma Tech brings the joy of 3- D entertainment into your home!
Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you...... my vision.
The Box in every home in America...... and one day, the world!
In local news, Edward Nygma' s 3- D Box...... has become the rage of Gotham.
Rioting occurred last night at electronic stores that were sold out.
There is hardly a home without the Nygma Tech Box.
Critics claim The Box turns Gothamites into zombies.
"That' s what they said when TV was invented."
Master Dick!
Up here.
Just checking, young sir.
Intruder alert.
Intruder alert.
It' s on the table.
I hope you like it.
Call it clinical intuition.
I thought your dreams needed changing.
My parents were murdered before me...... when I was a kid.
Flashes.
It' s a red leather book.
Something else...
My dreams come to me when I' m awake now.
Bruce, you' re describing repressed memories.
Images of a forgotten pain that' s trying to surface.
I' il be right back.
Is it possible there' s an aspect of your parents' death you haven' t faced?
You were so young when it happened.
Maybe I should leave you two alone.
This goes way beyond taking your work home, doesn' t it?
I think he' s fascinating.
Clinically.
Why does a man do this?
It' s as if he' s cursed to pay a penance.
What crime could he have committed to deserve a life of nightly torture?
It' s more than just...... professional interest, isn' t it, Chase?
Bruce, are you jealous?
I can' t be jealous of Batman.
I want to be close, but you won' t let me near.
What are you protecting me from?
Do you want to know me?
Do you want to know who I am?
The one in daylight, and the one we keep in shadow.
Rage...... violence...... passion.
Excuse me.
I' m busy.
I have some distressing news about Dick.
Is he okay?
I' m afraid Master Dick has gone traveling.
He ran away?
Actually, he took the car.
He boosted the Jag?
Not the Jaguar.
The other car.
The Bentley?
The other car.
Come for a little ride in my love machine, babies?
It' s Batman!
Open up, Batman.
That' s not Batman!
What do you mean?
That' s Batboy!
It ain' t the Bat!
Let her go!
Who the hell are you?
I' m Batman.
I forgot my suit, all right?
Come on, run!
Doesn' t Batman ever kiss the girl?
Go!
Thanks, you saved my life!
I could definitely get into this superhero gig.
Bastard!
It should' ve been you!
If you had told Two- Face who you were at the circus...... they' d still be alive!
If Bruce Wayne could' ve given his life for your family, he would have.
All I can think about every day is getting Two- Face.
He took my whole life.
When I was out there tonight...... I imagined it was him I was fighting...... even when I was fighting you...... and the pain went away.
Do you understand?
Yes, I do.
You must help me find him.
When we do...... I' m the one who kills him.
So, you' re willing to take a life?
As long as it' s Two- Face.
But your pain doesn' t die with Harvey, it grows.
So you run into the night to find another face, and another...... and another...... until one terrible morning you wake up and realize...... that revenge has become your whole life...... and you won' t know why.
You can' t understand.
Your family wasn' t killed by a maniac.
Yes, they were.
We' re the same.
If we' re the same, help me.
Train me, let me be your partner.
No.
I can' t.
You still have a choice.
Look, Bruce...... I' m a part of this, whether you like it or not.
Tonight all of Gotham society has turned out for Edward Nygma' s...... gala unveiling of his New Improved Box.
Thanks, Al.
My pleasure, sir.
They' il be dining and dancing the night away...... on the glamorous roof of the Ritz Gotham.
What' s it like to have your face on the cover of every magazine?
Edward, how does it feel to be the city' s newest, most- eligible bachelor?
Gotham must know!
There' s Bruce Wayne!
Brucie!
Oh, Eddie, he is too cute!
How come you don' t look so good in that suit?
You' re here to work!
Fine.
What about rumors of a Nygma Tech takeover of Wayne Enterprises?
Nygma Tech stock is outselling Wayne Enterprises two to one.
Are you yesterday' s news, Bruce?
Bruce, old man.
The press wonders what it' s like to be outsold, outclassed, out- coifed and...... generally outdone in every way.
Hello, Edward.
Congratulations.
Great party.
Nice suit.
Good.
And you are?
And what a grand pursuit you must be.
I' m Bruce Wayne, Miss...?
You can call me anything you want.
Ladies and gentlemen...... the future!
My New Improved Box offers fully- interactive holographic fantasies.
Edward, you' re dashing and a genius.
How do you create these images, hon?
That, my dear, is my little secret.
Fully- interactive holographs.
Only a high- frequency carrier wave, beamed into the brain...... could create such images.
And you wish you thought of it.
Don' t be a sore loser.
Give it a try.
If you can introduce images into the mind, what stops you from...... extracting images out of the mind?
Too timid to try my machine?
Shall we dance?
Naughty, naughty.
Looking for something?
I was just wondering how you turn it off.
Clever.
Thanks.
My pleasure.
Good evening, Mr. Wayne.
Relax.
Tell me your...... dreams.
Tell me...... your fantasies.
Tell me your secrets.
Tell me...... your deepest...... darkest...... fears.
Relax, folks!
It' s only an old- fashioned, low- tech stickup!
Cash, jewelry, cellular telephones.
Hand them over nice and quietly, and no one will be hurt!
Emergency, Alfred.
Yes, sir.
Just stay calm!
You' re ruining my big party!
Are you insane?
We' re sick of waiting for you to deliver Batman.
Patience, O Bifurcated One.
Patience, hell!
We want him dead!
And nothing brings out the Batman like a little murder and mayhem!
You could have let me in on the caper.
We could have organized it, planned it, pre- sold the movie rights!
Your entrance was good, his was better.
The difference?
Showmanship!
Emergency, Alfred.
I could be fired for this.
Perhaps they' il have me back at Buckingham Palace.
All right, boys!
Phase Two!
My place, midnight.
Nothing like a bad case of gas!
Why can' t you just die?
Hi.
What were you doing?
You got a real gratitude problem, you know that?
Batboy?
Knight Wing?
What' s a good sidekick name?
"Dick Grayson, college student."
Screw you!
You owe me.
You' re going to get yourself killed.
I' m your new partner.
No!
Whenever you go out at night, I' il be watching.
How will you stop me?
I can stop you.
Hang this next to the Batsuit...... where it belongs.
You' re encouraging him.
Young men with a mind for revenge need little encouragement.
They need guidance.
You, above all, should know the consequences of the life you choose.
Even Chase calls being Batman a curse.
Perhaps the lady is just what the doctor ordered.
She seems lovely and wise.
I' ve never been in love before.
Go to her.
Tell her how you feel.
She wants Batman, not Bruce Wayne.
Let her decide.
I' m sorry.
I can' t believe this.
I' ve imagined this moment since I first saw you.
Your eyes...... your lips...... your body.
Now I have you and...... I' m wishing you were somebody else.
I guess a girl has to grow up sometime.
I' ve met someone.
He' s not you.
I hope you can understand.
I understand.
That' s just what I said.
How to map the human mind.
Would you like to see what Bruce Wayne has in his head?
Riddle me this:
What kind of man...... has bats on the brain?
You can say it.
- You' re a genius.
Oh, stop.
So, from this day on...... Batman is no more.
You can' t just quit.
Batman has to protect the innocent.
I' ve dedicated my life to helping strangers I' ve never met.
Faces I' ve never seen.
Well...... the innocent aren' t faceless anymore.
You can' t tell me what to do with the rest of my life.
My dad told me that every man goes his own way.
My way goes to Two- Face.
You must help me.
And if you do find Harvey...... and then you kill him...... what next?
Then you' d be alone, like me.
No, you must let this go.
Listen to me, I' m your friend.
I don' t need a friend, I need a partner.
Two- Face has got to pay.
Please.
Chase is coming for dinner.
I' m going to tell her...... everything.
Come upstairs.
We' il talk.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Happy Halloween.
Happy Halloween to you.
I asked you here tonight because there' s something I wanted to tell you.
I wanted to tell you something too.
What I wanted...
Go ahead, you first.
Trick or treat!
All my life I have been...... attracted to a certain kind of man.
Look at what I do for a living.
And since...... since I met you, I...
Oh, God.
Why am I so nervous?
Don' t eat too much tonight or you' il be sick in your beds.
Happy Halloween!
What' s wrong?
My parents' death.
Your memories are trying to break through.
I want to tell you something.
Something I' ve never told anyone.
It' s all right.
I' m here.
I' m here.
The night of my parents' wake...... the priest' s words gave no comfort.
Of course.
There, on my father' s desk...... the red book.
He' d written in it every day.
But now he' d never write in it again.
At that moment I knew...... my life would never be the same.
The pain.
Then I fell.
I fell forever.
The cave was monstrous.
It must have been there for centuries.
And there...... deep in the shadows......
It was coming toward me.
I was scared at first, but only at first.
The figure in the dark was my destiny.
It would change my life forever.
I would use its image to strike terror into the hearts of those who did evil.
I would ensure what happened to me would never happen to anyone else.
I would have my revenge.
What are you trying to tell me?
I' m...
Twick or tweet!
Trick.
Remember the plan?
Seize and capture.
No killing.
That goes double for you.
If I was a superhero...... where would I hide?
Spank me.
Intruder alert!
Intruder alert!
Intruder alert!
Intruder alert!
Shut up!
Now, that' s impressive!
It' s always risky introducing a tamed animal into the wild.
They may have trouble adapting to their new environment.
Somebody tell the fat lady...... she' s on in five.
"Joygasm!"
Get the girl!
Don' t kill him.
If you kill him...
... he won' t learn nothing.
Master Bruce!
How are you, young man?
You haven' t called me that for a long time.
Old habits die hard.
Are you all right?
Where' s Chase?
I' m afraid they' ve taken her.
Master Dick has run away.
The cave has been destroyed.
And there' s another riddle.
I' m coming, my sweet.
Like the jacket?
It keeps me safe when I' m...... jogging at night.
Batman will come for me.
Batman, you say?
Coming for you?
I' m...... counting on it.
What is that?
Where' s it coming from?
There!
Who' s doing that?
The Riddler!
"We' re five little items of an everyday sort.
"You' il find us all in a tennis court."
Vowels.
Not entirely unclever, sir.
But what do a clock, a match, chess pawns...... and vowels have in common?
13, 1, 8...... and 5.
13, 1, 8 and 5.
Meaning?
Letters of the alphabet?
Of course, 13 is M.
1 would be A, 8 would be H and 5 would be E.
M- A- H- E.
Perhaps 1 and 8 are 18.
18 is R.
M- R- E.
How about...... "Mr. E"?
- Mystery?
- Another name for mystery?
Enigma.
Mr. E. Nygma.
Edward Nygma.
Stickley' s suicide was obviously a computer- generated forgery.
You really are quite bright, despite what people say.
Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
All except the prototype with the sonar modifications.
Tonight' s a good night.
What do you suggest?
By sea...... or by air?
Why not both?
Who' s your tailor?
I took the liberty, sir.
What' s that stand for?
Robin.
Riddler and Two- Face can make a pretty lethal combination.
You could use a hand.
Two against two are better odds.
I can' t promise I won' t kill Harvey.
"A man' s got to go his own way."
A friend taught me that.
Not just a friend.
A partner.
He' s not coming.
Shut it down.
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
Hey, go!
A- 14.
Hit!
Sweet!
B- 12.
Hit!
My favorite vitamin.
That sinking feeling.
I like this game.
C- 9.
You sunk my battleship!
Who, me?
This is your captain speaking.
Please return to your seats.
I got him!
I hope they can find the little black box.
Now...... the real game begins.
Holy rusted metal, Batman!
The ground, it' s all metal.
It' s full of holes: holey.
Wait!
The whole island' s moving!
Looking for us?
That was for my mother!
My father!
My brother!
And this is for me!
Finally, justice is served!
Let us die!
You' re a man after our own heart, son!
I' il see you in hell!
I' d rather see you in jail!
Good boy.
The Bat' s taught you well.
Stupid...... but noble.
Who' s afraid of the big black bat?
No more tricks, Edward.
Very well, then.
Let' s get real.
Release Chase.
This is between you and me.
And me...... and me!
You' ve sucked Gotham' s brain waves and now you' ve devised a way to read minds.
You betcha!
Soon my little Box will be on countless TV' s around the world...... feeding me credit- card numbers...... bank codes...... sexual fantasies...... and little white lies.
Into my head they' il go.
Victory is inevitable.
For if knowledge is power...... then a god...... am...... I!
Was that over the top?
I can never tell.
By the way, I' ve seen your mind.
Freak!
Yours is the greatest riddle of all!
Can Bruce Wayne and Batman ever truly coexist?
We' il find out today!
But first, let' s meet our contestants.
Behind curtain...... number one...
... the absolutely fabulous Dr. Chase Meridian!
She enjoys hiking, manicures...... and foolishly hopes to be the love of Bruce' s life.
Behind curtain number two...
... "Fatman' s" one and only partner.
This acrobat turned orphan...... likes Saturday- morning cartoons and dreams of one day being...... bare- naked with a girl.
A watery grave.
Just one little touch...... and five seconds later these two players are...... gull feed on the rocks below.
Not enough time to save them both.
Which one will it be, Batman?
Or the Dark Knight' s junior partner?
There is no way for me to save them or myself.
It' s all one giant death- trap.
Judges?
Your answer must be in the form of a question.
But thank you for playing.
Wait!
I have a riddle for you.
For me?
Really?
Tell me.
I see without seeing.
To me, darkness is as clear as daylight.
What am I?
Please!
You' re as blind as a bat!
Exactly.
Bummer!
Thanks.
All those heroics for nothing.
No more riddles, no more curtains one and two.
Just plain curtains!
Aren' t you forgetting something?
You' re always of two minds.
You' re right.
Emotion' s always the enemy of true justice.
You' ve always been a good friend.
Why?
Why can' t I...... kill you?
Too many questions.
Poor Edward.
I had to save them both.
You see, I' m both Bruce Wayne and Batman.
Now...... because I choose to be.
Thank you for responding to my request for a consultation, Dr. Meridian.
Edward Nygma...... has been screaming for hours that he knows the true identity...... of Batman.
Who...... is it?
It' s Dr. Meridian.
Do you remember me?
How could I forget?
Dr. Burton tells me...... you know who Batman is.
I can' t tell you if you don' t say, "please."
Edward, please.
Who is Batman?
I' m...... Batman.
Your secret is safe.
He is definitely a wacko.
"Wacko?"
Is that a technical term?
... I won' t need this anymore.
Thank you for giving me a new dream.
Don' t work too late.

Here are your hosts, Melbourne' s greatest chefs...
Baggio and Jackie!
Tonight, we combine the culinary arts... of the East and West.
Easy there, Jackie.
It' s like giving your true love a sensuous massage.
Then stretch and twist the dough.
Ladies, later, Jackie will do the same to your hair.
Now pull the dough into fine spaghetti noodles.
The alchemist works his magic, and before your eyes... a lump of dough transforms into delicious pasta.
Tina, baby.
You are so beautiful.
I know who you are.
You' re with the Demons.
Enjoy your stay!
Scumbag!
Tuck her in, boys!
Let' s go to town.
She' s a Demon girl.
For this bitch you betray me?
I just...
How much did they pay you?
I think I was drunk.
Some punk stole my coke... because you couldn' t control yourself?
I' il get it back.
Boss, the Demons are here!
Tara, you bitch.
You set me up.
Careful!
I' m good at cutting things off.
I thought we were here to do business.
Mr. Giancarlo, let' s deal.
Here' s half a million.
Give me back what' s mine, I let you walk away.
How much do you want?
All of it.
Not the whole 10 million.
What' s the world coming to... when a businessman has to pay to buy back his own stuff?
Only stuff I got is mine!
Call me when you' re ready to deal.
Go to hell!
You first!
Who the hell...
Get them!
Richard, hurry!
Hurry!
Go!
- What' s this?
- The girl and guy dropped it.
Get her!
I want this place spotless.
What the...
What' s going on?
Look out!
Why are they after you?
You OK?
Empty.
Now it' s empty!
Go!
What?
You' re fast.
There they are!
Climb!
This time, you go your way, I go my way.
- That way.
- Bye- bye.
You understand?
lce cream!
Go on, look around.
Right.
Have you seen a Chinese guy?
Me!
Another Chinese guy.
Right here!
He' s here!
Want some ice cream?
I now pronounce you husbands and wives!
Sorry.
This way!
Damn it!
Don' t worry.
Sorry.
Quick!
Over here!
My tape!
I think we got away.
You OK?
How about you?
I' m fine, but my poor car.
I' m sorry.
Thanks for coming to my rescue.
You' re welcome.
By the way, I' m Diana.
I' m Jackie.
You do that cooking show.
You' re a nice guy.
A nice guy.
Watch me on the Big Story tonight.
Big Story?
It' s Jeremy from channel 13.
Where' s your exclusive?
It' s Annie at Global.
We could do better than channel 13.
Hi, Lakeisha.
Grandpa!
Hi, Sonny, Nancy!
Dad, how are you?
Open the door!
Hi, everybody.
You' re looking sharp.
- I' m lucky to be here.
I was shopping, and I was shot at.
They were chasing a woman they thought was with me.
Was anybody hurt?
My poor car is full of holes.
- It did.
Who was this woman?
Her name' s Diana.
She said to watch the Big Story tonight.
I should take this down so I can file a report.
Put that away.
You' re off duty.
For this bitch you betray me?
This is cool!
I want to watch cartoons.
Melbourne' s greatest chefs...
Oh, my God.
First, knead the dough.
It' s like giving your true love a sensuous massage.
Help me.
Who is it?
Richard.
Let me in.
Sorry.
Now pull the dough into fine....
Hold it.
Where' s the tape?
It' s with that guy.
Don' t try anything stupid.
Whatever you say.
You trying to get a cheap thrill?
Don' t just stand there acting innocent.
Did you get a good feel?
That' s OK.
You can go.
Move it.
Don' t push me!
Hurry it up!
You men are all the same.
You can' t wait, can you?
Can' t wait to see what you' ve paid for.
No worries.
A gun?
Kinky!
Out of my way!
Watch out!
Right.
They' ve gone.
Where' s the phone?
Over there.
This looks great.
I can' t wait to see what happens on the Big Story.
What do you think of Jackie' s new recipes?
Delicious.
You never say that about my cooking.
Grandpa, you' ve always said being a chef is the best.
Being a cop is too dangerous.
The kitchen is a safe place.
That' s why Jackie' s not a cop.
That' s true.
Jackie' s dad and I were best friends.
Before he died...
I promised I' d take care of Jackie and keep him safe.
As long as I' m around, Jackie' s a chef, not a cop.
I' il go get dessert.
Strange.
Where' s your mystery woman?
I don' t know.
What are you doing tomorrow morning?
Taking a load of videos for the show.
Why?
- Can you take me to the airport?
We' re going!
Sonny, We' re leaving!
He' s dead.
Giancarlo, you' re a dead man.
Snake' s dead, Tina' s missing.
I' il teach you to mess with the Demons.
What do you think you' re doing?
I' m gonna shove these up Giancarlo' s ass.
Shut up!
You' il get us all killed.
Who do you want to kill, me or Giancarlo?
How long is she staying?
lf she likes it, she may stay longer.
Are you going to marry her?
Maybe.
Do you love her?
Miki.
What?
Nice to meet you.
What' d you say?
Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together... for everyone' s favorite culinary cut- ups...

He' s got a videotape that exposes us all.

You can explain it to the cops.
Uh- huh.
I got it right here.
Enough, you psycho!
Stop!
You' re trashing my place!
It' s not my fault.
And now I' m going to trash your butt!
How could you do this after I saved your life?
I' m sorry.
Look, I dropped a videotape in your car yesterday... and I have to get it back.
That must be the video the gangsters wanted.
You didn' t give it to them, did you?
Good.
Just give it to me.
- What?
You have to, because when I got home...
I had one of your stupid cooking videos.
Stupid?
Please.
I' ve got to have that tape.
I' il do anything.
What do you mean, do anything?
lf I had the tape, I would give it to you.
You should go to the police.
Please just go.
You don' t understand --
I know.
Sorry.
It' s OK.
You' re my last hope --
They' re coming to kill me.
What?
You were right.
Follow me.
Every time I see you, it' s trouble.
This way.
Wait.
Wait for me.
Yeah.
Are you scared?
Giancarlo needs that tape.
It' s bonus time.
Shit!
- No.
- OK.
Why did you stop?
I' m afraid of heights!
Come on!
Look straight.
Now what?
Close your eyes.
Now what?
Well done!
Payback time.
I' il check in here.
Hang on!
That' s the guy that' s got the tape.
I' il arrange a safe house for you all to stay in.
You mean like a jail?
No, thanks.
Jackie, I know you can take care of yourself, but what about the others?
Where are you going to stay?
Anywhere...
What?
Any problem with that?
No problem.
You' re all welcome.
No problem.
Jackie, be careful.
Gentlemen, you asked for a meeting.
We need that cocaine shipment.
There' s no product to sell.
How can I keep my men if I can' t pay them?
People don' t respect us anymore.
The Vietnamese are moving in on our territory.
Damn it, Giancarlo, you' ve got to do something.
Soon, we' il have nothing left.
Gentlemen, thank you for your concern... but I assure you business will continue as usual.
You may go.
Keeps his house so clean you can' t even fart.
Sorry.
We didn' t get the tape, and four guys got blown up.
What?
Either I get the tape, or you' il never be seen again!
Let me do that.
That feels good.
What is she saying?
She just wants to buy some clothes.
Not a problem.
I' ve got something that should fit her just fine.
What are you talking about?
She said, "Thank you for your generosity."
Come with me.
Don' t be shy.
Did you go anywhere else yesterday?
Get over here.
Oh, my God.
You want the tape, too?
lf you find it, please take it!
Just don' t hurt anyone.
Hey, who are you?
Cops!
- What' s the matter with you?
- Just hold it.
- Don' t try anything funny now.
- I won' t.
Come on, let' s go.
Take her!
The phone is gonna ring in 12 hours.

They were following my orders!
Cool down, OK?
I' il get her back.
You just stay out of my way.
lf you interfere in police business...
Go ahead!
Go ahead!
Jackie, don' t worry.
They need that tape.
What if they don' t call?
Hey, you!
What are you looking at, fat boy?
- Yeah, you!
What happened?
I' m too nosy.
Are you all right?
Where' s my girlfriend?
I don' t care what you do to me, just let her go!
Are you sure this is the right tape?
It' s the right tape.
Let her go.
We got the tape.
Let' s call Giancarlo and set up a meeting.
Boss, there' s a phone call for you.
We' ve got your tape and the cocaine.
The price is doubled.
Thank you very much.
Take the tape.
None of my business.
Watch the knife.
Where is my girlfriend?
Say it!
At the Golden Garden construction site.
- Let me go!
Tell me what happened!
Just let me go!
Let him go, let him go.
Stop.
Police brutality!
You' re all my eyewitnesses!
Hit me, somebody.
My pleasure!
He hit me.
You see that?
And your mother, too!
Wait.
Touch her again... and I cut 'em off.
Where' s my girlfriend?
We' il waste you, Demons!
Run!
You' re a pretty one.
Where' s my cocaine?
Where' s the tape?
And where' s my cocaine?
I don' t have the tape!
What happens to us if I tell you?
You' re free to go.
You have my word.
Two crates... in that room.
We found it!
She' s all yours, boys.
Run!
What happened?
Who cares?
Boss, the Chinese cook... he' s upstairs.
So who are you?
I' m Miki.
Jackie' s my boyfriend.
Oh, Jackie.
I must be living right.
Put that in the car.
Stand over there.
You' re gonna get us killed.
Lakeisha, you' re my star witness.
I' il get help.
Don' t hit me!
That way!
Grab one!
Hey!
What the hell are you doing?
He said no.
Put her down.
Finally, we meet.
Go!
Come here, hmm?
What' s so interesting on TV?
What' s the world coming to when a businessman... has to pay to buy back his own stuff?
Where' d you get the tape?
Uncle Jackie brought it.
- They' ve taken them hostage.
- Are they hurt bad?
I don' t know.
We' ve got units standing by.
You better get down here.
I' m on my way.
This is all the information we have on Giancarlo.
I owe you one.
- I won' t forget.
I can' t even sit?
The boss is very meticulous about his home.
Hand over the tape.
I don' t have it!
- It' s at my friend' s.
- So call him.
Where are you?
It' s Jackie.
You haven' t seen it?
Good.
Address?
What' s the address?
Anybody know the address?
They won' t tell me.
Yes.
Don' t go anywhere.
See you soon.
You like to play games?
Let' s play one of mine.
The judge is looking at the tape right now.
We' re close to breaking this wide open.
I don' t want a loose cannon jeopardizing the case... so I' m here to make sure there are no more screwups.
Now, I want you to cool down.
Show me what you got.
Almost got me.
What am I paying you idiots for?
He almost got me that time!
Take your best shot.
Don' t spit in my house.
No!
Pull!
ldiot!
Luigi and the others, they' re here.
Take him to the guesthouse!
Out of the way!
Luigi.
They might as well give us condoms.
I' il look after this one.
Look out!
Quick, quick, quick!
Get out!
Remember, stay cool.
We want to see Giancarlo.
Maybe he doesn' t want to see you.
That kind of rudeness simply will not be tolerated.
You wish to see me?
Captain Morrison, NEA.
This is Romeo Baggio.
lf you' ve done anything to him --
I have no idea who you' re talking about.
You Jackie?
You' re the city' s biggest drug lords.
I told you to cool it!
You know the law.
I could shoot you like a dog for trespassing... so why don' t you just leave?
Let' s get out of here.
Can you believe those two?
That Romeo' s got some big brass ones.
He better be careful... or he' il find them hung on his Christmas tree.
What' s that doing here?
I know it' s Jackie.
Do something!
Who?
Sorry, Captain.
Did you see anything?
No, Captain, I didn' t see anything.
Right.
No, sir!
Come on, gentlemen.
Up you go.
Take him away.
Jackie, we got here as soon as we could.
- Really, we did.
- Yeah, right.
Honest, Jackie.
- Why?
Oh, my God.
My dialogue?
Now I' m nervous.
When I speak English, I' m nervous!
I' m --
I' m lucky to be here.
Just happy.
THE END Subtitles by:
- How fast?
Incredible!
Another record before I leave!
Keep the stopwatch I don' t need it.
Speech!
Where is my little Daniel?
As you all know Daniel resigned last night
He quits the 2 wheelers for the 4 wheelers
He follows the reverse human evolution that starts on all fours,...... and finishes on its 2 wheels!
I want him to know he was the best of all of us,...... and most of all, a very good friend.
You going be missed by all of us you know.
Or did your lips just slip?
It' s not that I didn' t like it but I don' t know what to think anymore.
Is it clearer now?
Because if it slipped again, you must be really clumsy.
And now to celebrate Daniel' s departure...... I announce the big parade!
Open your eyes wide, Lily, because you won' t see this again in your life.
- How many are there?
These are the best.
Go for it!
Holy shit!
- So having a little party?
- Are they from the pizzeria?
- Pizza cops.
- Sorry but we would like to see your papers.
I' m sorry we left them inside if you want we can go get them now.
- Ok but make it fast.
- No problem, thanks.
Let' s run!.
It must have been 5 minutes now.
Yeah, it' s my apartment but it' s also kind of a garage.
I hope that...
Hmm, it' s... different.
- Daniel.
We' ve known each other for two years now.
why did you wait until the day you quit to show me your apartment?
- I take a long time to decide.
- And what made you decide?
Your cleavage.
The dress is brand new.
Ok then we' il try not to damage it.
Are you sure it' s okay after all these years of friendship?
We prepared the ground well, it' s time to build on it.
- Maybe we could wait a little bit more.
- No, If I wait more,...... I' m worried that you' il take it badly and I don' t want to be rude.
- Oh, no.
- What?
- It' s 6 o' clock.
- But it' s Saturday.
- What?
You just stopped working last night, you didn' t find a job during the night, did you?
No, it' s for my future job...... a kind of meeting I booked a long time ago.
I thought you were waiting for our meeting for a long time.
Yes, a long time plus an hour.
And when I say 1 hour, that' s the maximum.
Hey blue, you take a number over there.
Don' t forget your photos next time.
247.
It' s not even close to my number.
- How long have you been a driver?
- 25 years yesterday.
I' m retired since this morning.
It' s the first morning I can my newspaper calmly in the last 25 years.
Ah I see.
wake up number 247!
I' m here!
Your paper, 2 pictures... sign here... and here.
Professional Licence, traffic certificate,...... acquisition autorisation, the notebook, the plates and the sign.
- Yes.
- Nothing more after 6 years?
- You want me to sing the national anthem?
No, not really but a smile would have been nice.
248!
Lily!
It' s 12: 00, I went to buy some croissants...... and in the meantime I married the baker.
Goodbye and so long.
Congratulations, Mr. Daniel.
You' re welcome.
No, we insist.
- Hi, Daniel!
- You' re in the tourism business now?
Your party was great we drank like crazy.
But your bike sounds weird, is it ok?
- What' s wrong?
It’ s making a weird noise?
Is it working ok?
I use super- unleaded.
I just outran 2 cops, you should have seen it.
Ok I' il tell you, 2 police on bikes on the street.
When they shifted into first, I was already on the beach.
They were furious.
Los dejé atrás a toda velocidad, no podían creerlo.
Those 2 won' t forget Paulo that easily.
I assure you they did not forget you, Paulo.
Hey Girls.
Still wearing the moustache!?
Go, Paulo.
Hey girls, going to the beach?
Today it' s free.
It will be a pleasure.
Hey are you a "taxi", or a nice taxi?
- And he carries the bags if asked nicely.
- Thank you, perfect.
And where are we going, miss?
You see the pink house over there, with a big door?
- That' s where we' re going.
Do you prefer a route in particular?
Put all that in the kitchen, I' il organise it later.
- You have enough food for a week there.
- Oh no, my son is coming for lunch.
- He eats all that in one meal?
Sunday he prepares...... all his meals for the week,
His apartment is so small there' s no kitchen.
And he can' t even cook an egg.
That' s him in the picture.
He' s a computer geek.
He works at IBM.
- Everybody has their thing.
What is your "thing"?
I love driving, but you probably didn' t have time to see it!
My son is taking his driving exam for the 8th time.
8 is my lucky number it will be good for him.
At the end of the street, we' re going to turn to the... to the... to the... to the
To the left, Mr. Carbadec.
To the left, to the left!
To the left!
We' re going to crash!
Jesus Christ!
I' ve never seen such an idiot in the 10 years I' ve worked here!
Can' t you tell right from left?
- Yes but you should have told me sooner.
LEFT LEFT!
It' s no so difficult to turn a steering wheel and press a pedal!
- Everyone has their strengths.
- And you what is your job?
Where they hell do they hire idiots like that?
- In a circus, in a zoo, the government or what?
A little bit of all three.
- Ah you should have said it earlier.
- Should I have sent a Fax?
Excuse me.
Can I offer you something, inspector?
Thank you, that' s great.
Thanks you.
You' re so nice, I' m going to keep your card.
I don' t want to be rude but I need to go work, Is it ok if I eat in the Taxi?
Go Work!
- Can you save my life?
- In theory, no.
It depends on your symptoms.
I have a flight in 25 minutes.
If I miss it I' m a dead man.
If I catch it, you' re a rich man.
Hmm... the gentleman is lucky.
I' m no doctor,...... but I really like emergencies.
Maybe we should go now.
Here we go.
A white taxi moving really fast!
- He knocked down my radar!
- We' il care of it - got his plate number?
- I didn' t have the time it was too fast.
- Open your eyes, it' s your job.
Do you think we' re going to make it on time?
Because if we' re going to miss it maybe we should take our time.
It' il be ok, we' re going slow now, but on the highway we' il speed up.
Ah I see, I see.
I don' t want you to lose your license.
No problem, I don' t have a license.
Fantastic.
14 minutes and 30 seconds.
Leaves you time to read the paper and maybe a cup of coffee.
Have a good trip, sir.
Thank you.
I don' t understand.
On the computer I' m unbeatable.
First in Monaco, 8 pole positions.
But on the streets I' m a disaster.
How did you do?
- I didn' t make it.
That' s impossible.
I know champagne is better with time...... but now it' s almost past the due date.
What happened?
Nothing, I just crashed into a butcher shop.
You know what?
You should put a mouse in your car, instead of your steering wheel.
Like the disabled.
Emilien, someone just set a new record.
A taxi, near the harbour.
You know how fast?
- 140?
- Yeah, in first gear.
Then he switched into 2nd... 217 Km/ h!
- Yeah of course, they called in the air force.
Imagine at that speed.
Hey, have you heard this one?
Listen, it' s funny.
What' s the difference between a comb and a moron?
- Ok you' re not listening.
- Yes.
Much later, and if it' s at night, that' s even better.
Next time, knock before you enter!
Petra...
I don' t mean that for you.
Thanks, Emilien.
So how did it go with your test, was it bad?
Ah, news travels fast.
I have news for you, the Chief is having a meeting now, and only you are missing.
Well, nobody told us you know!
- All you have to do is push this button...
You see there, it' s written "power".
You hear me?
I said in my office right now, are you deaf Emilien?
After hitting banks in Holland, Italy and Belgium... the Mercedes gang has arrived in France
And the Germans must absolutely not invade our territory again.
My grandfather died in their hands, so it' s a personnal matter.
So the Paris- Bonn liaison, German- French friendship, can kiss my ass.
That doesn' t apply to you Petra.
You' re German... fine, but you' re a cop so it' s ok.
And they have the gall to announce the cities before hitting the banks!
Within 3 days, they will hit a bank in Marseille.
Red Alert, 24 hours a day!
We will have some support in the form of one trained driver per team.
As soon as the Germans leave the bank, our teams will follow them.... not losing them, acting like a venom....
That' s why this operation will be called... Cobra.
Petra, can you assemble the teams please?
3 per car.
One driver, one coordinator and one sniper.
Each team has a code name and a position written on the map behind you.
The team members are listed next to the map.
You have 50 minutes to get into position.
Excuse me Petra, it' s that dinner we talked about...... this week would be nice, because...... the computer software I developed, that we' ve talked about... it would be better not to wait too long, somebody could steal the idea.
- No.
Just who can' t wait, you or the software?
No, him... it, the software... the computer.
You see, it' s complicated That' s why I thought...... a dinner...
As soon as the Germans are arrested, I promise, I' il take care of you...... of the software I mean.
- By the way, which team are you in?
Don' t worry, you got lucky.
I put you in the best team.
Hey, I think we' re out of coffee.
Have you seen my steering wheel?
It' s great, it' s personalized...... I bought it from Alain Prost.
With a new grip, special Dakar.
With even a ton of sand in the car...
Too bad we aren' t at the beach then.
Hey hey, don' t smoke, it irritates my eyes.
- No coffee, no smoking...
- No chicks!!
I repeat:
Boa calling Tiny Snake.
- This is TinySnake, I hear you.
- Yeah, it' s Alan.
Is your team any good?
Amazing.
We' re all exchanging addresses.
Somebody is pissing on us but apart from that everything' s fine.
Rachid, check out the small black Peugot behind us.
We' re not going to steal a car during the day!
Oh yeah, why not?
Fuck Marco!
We don' t know this neighbourhood, we should stick to what we know.
Don' t worry, all the cops are at the airport!
- There aren' t any around here for 20 Km.
- This is crazy.
- Calm down man!
All the cops are at the airport I told you!
I saw it on TV, there' s Clinton and this girl.
Hey, cops!
Check it out, Marco is here, he' s gonna screw you!
- Let' s arrest him.
- No, let him take the car,...... let him finish his show, we need the space.
I need to take a leak.
No we can' t leave the car, it' s orders.
You see?
All at the airport like I said.
Smile guys, you' re on camera.
I tell you guys if they don' t show up in one minute with their Mercedes...... it' s going to be coffee, a smoke and a shit.
We' re going to do all that later man!
To all snakes... no venom until the mouse leaves its hole.
I repeat no venom until the exit.
- Petra, you' re disturbing me, I was into it.
I know, but it' s the minister.
- Minister, you aren' t at the airport?
- We just finished.
Tell me Gibert … what about that Mercedes gang you told me about?
Yes, you couldn' t have called at a better time, we just located them.
- I just talked to the German minister - Stop there
They won' t have time to visit Marseille
Exactly my point.
- The war is over, Gibert.
- Of course it is, Mister.
They are criminals just like any others, they won' t be treated any differently.
Maybe you should start by not calling them Nazis.
- Yes.
- Ah, I called them Nazis?
- I can count on you?
- Yes, don' t worry, remember the chinks...
Um, I mean the Asians.
Everything went smoothly.
Almost no deaths, at least not on our side.
He hung up!
You see, it' s easy.
- Where are the wires?
Are you going to steal the car or do I have to give you the keys?
We are the Tiny Snakes and that means we stay "cool".
We' re going to take it "cool", and not get venomous.
To all snakes, don' t mess up, we want them alive.
I don' t really feel in the mood, I guess I' d better leave you guys.
I really have to take a leak.
Let' s go!!
- What' s going on?
- It doesn' t look good, Minister.
Don' t move, Minister.
Shit!
We fell into a trap, send us backup.
I identified the car...
I repeat, I identified the accomplice car.
- Backup are coming, Minister!
Shit, shit!
I think we are shooting at cops.
They' re giving up... aren' t they?
Hello, this is Tiny Snake, we' ve had a small problem with the door.
Don' t worry, we' il have you free you in 5 minutes.
Thank you, Sir.
Ok, they' re giving up.
Funny... he looks just like...
- Oh, you didn' t eat anything.
- I' m not really hungry today.
- Mom, no.
- Don' t worry about your license.
- Remember your father, he never got one either.
- How is that possible?
- I remember him driving when I was young - Yes, it' s true.
He took the exam 20 times and in the end they just gave it to him!
- Ah Thanks, I feel a lot better now.
Here, David, the landlord' s son asked me if you could fix this.
Yeah, tell him my name isn' t Super Mario.
No, I know your name is Super Cop, the one who upholds the law... and protects citizens against evil.
Oh dear, you have a good profession, I' m proud you.
That' s why you tell everyone I work at IBM?
Do you want me to bring you all the neighborhood parking tickets?
You' re quiet and so am I.
I get to fix all the neighborhood electronic toys.
- Never happy.
- Mom, I' m kidding!
- can you call me a taxi?
- I just met the perfect one!
Friendly, pleasant, the cream of the crop.
You' il like him very much.
- Am I on the wrong floor?
- That depends, who you are looking for?
- I' m looking for Camille.
- That' s me.
- Oh you' re her son the one who works at Apple.
- No, IBM.
I don' t know anything about computers.
But I saw your picture the other day.
Ah Daniel, this is my son Emilien.
I put labels on them - Monday is veal, Tuesday...
I left the car alone, I' m worried.
- Kiss, kiss mom!
- Where are we going?
- I remember the police station but not IBM.
- We are going to the police station.
I install computers there.
I don' t really like being around pigs.
- Say, that motor sounds great for a taxi.
- You know cars?
Just a fan.
It' s a V6, a bit modified.
A motor just wants to "sing".
Um, don' t sing too loud, the speed limit is 50.
- You' re talking about the signs written 50?
I thought it was for skateboards.
No, no, I think it' s for anything that drives.
There' s driving and driving, you see I' m at 100.
No risks.
I' m less dangerous at 100 then that shit at 20 km/ h.
You saw it?
I saw it, yeah!
- You' re not afraid of radars?
- We know where there are radars.
Pigs doesn' t like change.
Always eating at the same place.
You' il see, there' s one just here.
You see them, they' re so stupid.
Picture!
You know they can' t do anything about it, they just follow the system.
They signed up, nobody forced them.
Sometimes I guess they are forced to join
- Look,...... I see them a lot... because of the computers.
The image I had of them was wrong.
It' s worse than we hear of them?
No. it' s better.
There aren' t just idiots in the police force.
Right, there are also alcoholics, crooks, morons!
Seriously, between us...... you know any normal person who would want to join the pig farm?
- What about them?
You know anybody that would want to become a taxi driver?
Those complainers that take you only when feel like it.
And that scream at you when the tip isn' t good.
And drinking in the coffee shops!
They are all friends with the police.
Y se casan con una portera para tener casa gratis.
You' re not married to a cop?
- Ah that' s reassuring!
Ok, there are maybe a few drivers who are rude with the customers.
With the police it' s the same thing.
They aren' t all drunk at 6 in the morning, beating on innocent people.
Some of them do their jobs, just like you... and like me.
Maybe, yeah maybe.
But the thing is, being a taxi driver isn' t my real job.
Ah you drive a taxi only for fun... what is your real job then?
I' m going to show you.
Do you have a bag, I don' t feel good.
Don' t worry, as long as we drive fast, nothing will come out.
Shit!
I' m sorry sir, that' s the first time that' s happened with me.
Usually the client gets out and walks a bit... then...
- I' m really sorry.
- I' m going to confess something.
Me too, that' s not my real job...
- Oh, yes.
- Last and first Name.
- Morales, Daniel.
Profession... should I write crazy taxi driver or just crazy driver?
Whatever you want.
- At what speed were you going back there?
- Barely 90.
- Yes, it seems worse because the motor really kicks.... but in reality, the car doesn' t really go that fast.
- Hey world champion, how' s it going?
- Can you go look in the stands to see if I' m there?
Remember that taxi, we saw it 5 minutes ago on the street.
He' s slowing down!
Not 90... 190.
I didn' t see the 1 on the speedometer.
That' s why I saw 90.
If I had known, I would have slowed down.
Anyway, 90 is illegal.
The limit is 50... for everybody! cars, skateboards, taxis... everybody!
Is he happy now? caught ht me, did his job, he' s happy now.
My license is my living, if tonight I' m not driving, tomorrow I' m dead.
You' re going to be nice and finish me quickly.
Hey slow down, so I can enjoy it a bit.
Usually I' m the one screamed at all day, now for once I get lucky.
- I didn' t knock because of my wrist.
- That you didn' t knock I mean.
- Your dinner, your software that can' t wait.
So it will wait until I' ve healed.
Unless you want to have dinner with a scarecrow.
I doesn' t bother me... you' re perfect Petra.
It' s not important...
I mean no... yes it matters
It' s important.
It' s very bad for you...... but for me.. for the software it doesn' t matter.
You see!
All day it' s like that.
If only I could catch those German bastards
You' re going to finish me now?
You' il see, you' il feel better.
Yeah, I have to... unless you have an idea.
- Can promise not to do it again?
- I said an idea, not a an idiocy.
I' m talking about a real idea of public interest.
- No!
Something of public interest, for me.
It' s like I represent the public...... and you do something in my interest.
- Ah you want money!.
- You' re really stupid!
Tell me clearly what you want.
It' s been an hour now with your blabbing.
- What do you want?
The Mercedes gang, does that ring a bell?
No, the only gangs I know would be into scooters.
They' re a gang specialized in robbing banks.
Yesterday was the 7th.
- Ah that' s too bad.
Yes, mostly for us.
Listen, I' il make you a proposal.
You' re a good mechanic, you drive well and I need a driver.
I' il remove all your infractions.
- You want me to be a cop for 1 month?
- Choose: cop or pedestrian.
- Death or shame?
- You got it.
Here you have all 7 attacks in order.
Don' t know much about Mercedes I' m more Ferrari.
Right now the gang is "Mercedes" but as soon they get into Ferraris, I' il call you.
- A red Mercedes, how awful.
- I know it' s red, tell us something we don' t know.
We' ve looked everywhere but maybe...
- You' re talking about a detail...
They' re German.
Very nice!
You want to relax 5 minutes now?
You must be exhausted.
The tires are very inflated, typical of Germans.
Also they have 8 "so they had to do that in Germany 'cause you can' t find that in France.
The Tires are quite worn, they' il need to order some soon.
In this picture, the muffler is a little bent but not on this one.
They must have bent it during an attack and repaired it afterwards.
Kruger is the only one who repairs this type in Marseille.
And Kruger is German.
Luckily you' re not a Mercedes expert!
- Where are we going?
- We' re starting with Kruger to see if he remembers anything.
You want me to sing a song?
In this neighbourhood, I wouldn' t turn the Christmas lights on.
- What are we doing now?
Get familiar with the terrain, observation of entrances and exits.... and analyse the situation.
When it closes we' il go ask Mr. Kruger a few questions.
- Kruger?
He never closes, he' s an insomniac.
Thanks!
They didn' t have anything else.
Too bad we didn' t stop by my mother' s, she makes terrific sandwiches.
Half Bayonne, half Parisian.
- It' s excellent.
A small slice of cheese in the middle with lettuce.... and pickles.
Fabulous.
- This is mine?
- Really good, congratulations.
- What does he do?
- They' re Koreans.
A real pain in the ass for me, they work 24 hours a day.
- He must sleep at some point, they' re human.
- No, they' ve got a "technique".
One taxi, one plate, one license...... and 2 drivers.
- You can tell the difference between 2 koreans - incredible.
I know a Korean, he' s in the food business.
We wait for him to close the garage.
We' re going to wait a long time, the guy is an insomniac and never closes.
- How do you know that?
- From the bar owner just in front of us.
Why didn' t you tell me before?
I haven' t been in the police force long, I don' t have the reflexes.
It' s not a matter of being a cop, it' s just common sense, shit!
We' re here like 2 idiots waiting for an insomniac to go to sleep!
Does that sound logical to you?
If I' m the Mercedes driver and I know the mechanic is an insomniac...... I' il come during the night, it' s much more discrete.
You think the driver will just show up...... with his nice Mercedes?
I can' t believe it!
When a driver isn' t driving, he' s in the garage.
- What are they doing there?
- Probably the 8 "tires they ordered from Kruger.
It' s a miracle!
I can' t let such an opportunity get away.
if it goes bad, call the station and give them the Mercedes plate numbers.
- Where are you going?
- After observation, action.
The Korean trick!
What an idiot!
And the new tires, where are they going to put them?
- What are you doing there?
Sleeping.
I don' t have a house, my country is very cold.
Please!
I just wanted to sleep.
I' m going to find you a house where you' il sleep... and even eat maybe with a little bit of luck.
- Hey you' re hurting me!
- I just do what I can.
- Daniel.
Daniel.
I' m Emilien.
- We' re going to call each other by name, it' il be better.
Now that we' re friends, what just happened...
It stays between us...
When you let go of my hand, can I go to bed?
I' m no insomniac or Korean.
I waited for you all night.
I did it on purpose, so that you really want me.
You won' t regret waiting.
Promises, promises.
Let me see what you can do.
Ah, not too bad.
A little bit more.
What' s going on?
It' s 6 am and it' s not Sunday, it' s Monday.
You can' t do that, Lily.
Did I play dominos?
- Can' t you call in sick?
Sick on Monday morning?
My boss will love that.
Nobody has ever tried that one.
It can happen to anybody to be sick Monday morning.
You went to eat at your parents and you ate too much...... and you puked all night.
It' s possible, isn' t it?
Do you think it' s reasonable?
I' m really sorry, Lily.
I had a shitty day.
I promise that if you accept a dinner here tonight, I' il explain everything.
Ok, just a light meal.
I don' t want to be sick on Tuesday morning.
Yes, a short time at the table and a long time in bed.
We could even eat in bed to save time.
You' d better be good, it' s your last chance.
I' m going to impress you.
We' re going to wait all day in front of the garage again?
Observation is finished, now comes questioning.
- No.
- Well, you' re going to come anyway.
It' s better if I wait in the taxi, in case things go bad... like last time.
I don' t want him to confuse me with technicalities.
Kruger won' t waste time to kick you out, I' m telling you.
Good morning people.
which one of you is called Kruger, please?
It' s written on the label just like a waitress.
Mr. Kruger, I' ve got a few questions for you.
Don' t worry, it won' t be long.
- Fuck no more ammo!
- Really?
- Open your eyes, there' s nobody here.
Oh yeah, nobody.
- Can I ask you a little question?
- What?
Are your questioning sessions always like that, or was it just to please me?
Usually I get to ask at least 1 question.
Let' s go out to get some air.
- You know, you saved my life back there.
It was worth a lot.
And turn it into only 1 week.
- I need to catch that gang, it' s important for me.
- No.
In part yes, but mostly for me.
I' m tired of finishing off nights in the garbage can.
It' s a question of honour, maybe it' s crazy, but I need this.
- Can I have the night for myself?
- You' ve got to be kidding.
- Can I borrow him?
- Mom, it' s because...
I lost my prescription and the doctor agreed to write another one.
They' re closing in 5 minutes.
It' s my heart medicine.
I won' t let you die here, and that way I' il have saved the whole family today.
- I know, I know.
- Look Johnny, here they come.
I' ve put a transmitter in that bullet, that way they won' t get away.
- You' re so clever Johnny - It' s my job, baby.
- Johnny.
- Now we just have to follow them.
- Incredible! -... let' s save your father.
- I' il never forget what you' ve done for me Johnny.
- It' s my job, baby.
Guys, we just received a call.
It' s gonna be the Bank of Marseille.
Since they are clear with us, I' m going to be the same with you.
I won' t tolerate any misbehaviour, any accidents, nothing!
Perfect coordination.
There are 2 words for this mission...
Serenity...... and efficiency.
So I' ve decided to name this mission..
Zen.
Chief!
I just got the idea of the century.
The Mercedes gang will be nailed tonight, or my name isn' t Emilien Barbadec.
I hope your plan is foolproof 'cause this is your last chance.
You' ve got the gun, so be nice and don' t miss.
Everybody on the floor!
Quickly!
Hands on the head!
Don' t move.
- It' s working.
Follow them at a distance.
So you won' t be scared.
Gauguin Street.
I' m telling you, we' ve got them.
This is Gilbert.
All units: close off Gauguin street at 10 Km. around.
They didn' t move.
Just one street.
What' s happening?
- The dot disappeared.
- I know it disappeared.
- Find out why it vanished.
- They must be this way,...... a red Mercedes doesn' t go by unnoticed.
They' re close, I can feel it.
They' re supposed to be here.
Don' t shoot, I' m the hostage.
Emilien...
How...?
I don' t understand, I' m missing something.
Even Houdini never did that.
Hello, your papers please.
What' s going on, officer?
- You' re German?
- Yes Why?
Already at the border?
Chief, 4 Germans in a Mercedes, not red.
Interested?
- So you' re German.
- Yes, is that a problem?
No, it' s good actually.
Open the trunk.
- What are they doing in Marseille?
-... but they can do that in another country if you prefer...
- No,...... I prefer that you keep that in our territory.
Have a nice stay.
Emilien.
I don' t understand, it' s impossible.
- You see, he forgot about the kettle.
- You think so?
He' s not like that.
It' s 8pm.
I' ve turned on the answering machine, and the alarm is set for 6am.
- We' ve got 10 hours.
It should be enough, no?
- I think it' s going to be close...... but we can hurry just a bit at the end.
Expecting somebody?
Yes my lover, but when I found out you' d come, I cancelled.
- Who could it be?
- Leave it, they' il probably go.
- Where were we?
- I was kissing you.
No, you were kissing me.
- How?
I don' t know... the cops...
Yeah, maybe you' re a notorious criminal and they' ve come to get you.
And if you just took me now?
- Open, Police!
- You didn' t kill anybody?
No.
Thank God, Daniel!
You' re here!
Fantastic!
- You just can' t imagine what shit I' m in.
No, no you can' t imagine.
It' s gone, we don' t have an apartment anymore.
The apartment that my father gave us.
- Gone up in smoke, just like my father.
- My husband smoked a lot,...... but he died of liver cancer, we never knew why, he didn' t drink.
The apartment is nothing, the worst is that I messed up again.
If I don' t catch them by the end of the week, I' il be on traffic patrol by Monday.
Stick, whistle, move along kids!
What I' m saying is, Monday I' m dead.
- Daniel, who' s that dwarf?
- A friend.
Playing with smurfs now?
- It' s a bit complicated, he' s a cop...
- Not a real friend,...
-... I work for him, because...
- You work for the cops?
No, not for the cops, for him!
He' s not really a cop....... he looks more like a secret agent, or something like that.
Right, and the old lady is Mata Hari.
Can someone explain this to her?
I can' t do it.
My name is Camille.
The smurf over there is my son, Emilien.
I want you to show me the kitchen, I' m going to make us some coffee. - and then I' il explain everything.
- There' s nothing to explain mom...... I' m finished, I' m in the street.
It' s over, but it started so well... but then came the garbage bin, the butcher, the Mercedes...
Should I call the cops, the real ones?
Just be nice, and don' t complicate the situation.
I just want to finish what we started.
And I don' t want to waste an hour because the schedule is very tight.
I' m caught in a tight spot and when I say caught I mean seriously.
I could lose my license for 100 years.
I help him and he gives me back my licence, 100 years of unemployment you see?
Police, blackmailer, and smurf.
Nice picture, you could have finished him before putting him in traffic.
Here you go, it was completely stupid of me.
I' m not kidding, you' re free.
Take it.
Daniel, you know I didn' t come here because of our deal.
I haven' t got any other friends.
Mom told me you had a big heart.
"Daniel has a big heart.
It doesn' t matter.
It' s not important, it' s not your problem.
Don' t worry, I' il catch that gang alone.
Without a car, it won' t be easy.
But I' m gonna do it.
Listen, the best way to get rid of him is to solve his problem.
But he doesn' t have one problem, he' s got a thousand.
Look at his face, he reminds me of "silence of the lambs".
You take care of Mata Hari and I' il take care of the smurf.
- In 2 hours I' m back.
- And what do I do with the lady for 2 hours?
- Please, Lily.
- It' s a deal.
- Come on.
- To solve your problem.
I' m sorry to have ruined your evening.
- Your coffee is really good?
- The best in town.
A nice coffee to change the mood and for forgiveness.
- Ok?
- Is 1 minute enough?
I thought about it all night and there was one question I couldn' t answer.
Why are they pissing us off like that?
Why a red Mercedes when grey is much more discrete?
To get our attention:
look here, then...... it appears over there!
It' s a diversion!
Conclusion: i think they left the building empty- handed and the money took another route.
Or maybe the money is still in the bank.
1 minute, end of show.
I' il be back later.
- 10 grand.
- Thank you very much.
- To help pay the rent for the next few years.
- And my wife?
- You really want her?
- Well, I' m used to her now.
Calm down dear.
Now, everything' s going to be fine.
"One more bank, and we retire."
And for the last one, I suggest we finish greatly.
Emilien!
I' il tell you how they changed from a red to a grey Mercedes.
- Go ahead.
- They didn' t change the car, they changed the colour.
A nice red Mercedes enters the parking lot...... and a classic grey Mercedes exists and then disappears.
- Is it possible?
- Child' s play.
If they did repaint the car we would have found paint traces somewhere.
Unless they used a truck to get the car in.
They' d need to buy tons of paint if they do that each time.
They did it in record time, they had less than 10 minutes.
Is there paint which dries in 10 minutes?
Sorry to wake you, it' s Daniel.
I need your magic paint, the MD10.
Color metal grey.
You ran out?
Who could have bought all that in one shot?
At the race track?
Are they painting the track red?
I' il try dealing with them myself.
Talk to you soon, thanks man.
- What does that mean, MD10?
- Less than 10 minutes.
You like my theory?
- You think it' s them?
- No, it' s some old ladies training every Tuesday.
What' s the plan?
- What are you doing?
- We' re going to say hello.
- They' re going to see us.
- Yep, we' il make it so they won' t forget us.
They' re going to remember me, they saw me in the trunk!
- Oh shit.
Is it alright like that?
It' s perfect.
Think you' re Schumacher?
You spin around the track.
What are those little cars you' ve got?
Mercedes?
They build cars too?
Do Germans know how to play the tortoise and the hare?
He doesn' t know how to play?
Give me 55.
- Maybe I should get out now, eh?
- No, you' il see, they' re playful.
The turtle and the hare goes like this...... 55 to the one that passes my car over 2 laps.
- You know how to count?
- We don' t want the money.
I said 55 because I had a good conscience not to take more.
But a tourist that doesn' t get robbed is not really a tourist, right?
Look in your rear- view mirror in case I' ve already lapped you after the 1st lap.
So it wouldn' t be worth an doing an extra lap.
Thanks girls!
Get lost!
Quick!
It' s not that I' m bored but I gotta go to the garage.
It just doesn' t run fast anymore.
Whenever you want, we' il have a rematch.
- Here' s your 55.
- What are we doing now?
- Let' s get a drink.
French...
You' re completely crazy, we had the whole gang.
- We could have called for backup and got them!
- Yeah, on what?
Great evidence.
We need to catch them in the act, that' s what you said?
But for the moment we' re only collecting offences.
If we continue, it' s us who will end up in jail.
You' il have your flag.
Now they' re all warmed up and nobody' s more playful than a pilot.
Now we can set a trap for them.
- Yeah?
What kind of trap?
- And what is your "idiot trap"?
- Not an "Idiot trap".
- Ok.
It goes like this: we make them go where we want.
And this is: here.
We' il need 20 traffic light keys and 20 super Walkie- Talkies.
Walkie- Talkies are ok but for the keys, the guys always carry them.
Except when they take their showers.
- Oh no?
- Oh yes.
You' ve got talent!
Here you go, Jimmy.
- One minute.
Emilien, I got one...
What are you doing naked?
I' m not naked.
I' ve got a towel wrapped around me.
What do you care?
I have the right to be naked in my office, no?
- It' s my office isn' t it?
Nobody taught you to knock before entering?
You' ve never learned anything idiot!
I wanted to tell you a good joke.
Your jokes are never funny, get out!
Ah! it feels so good!
COME IN!
- Am I disturbing you?
- Never!
Yes, I can see I' m disturbing you.
I' il come back later.
Can you believe that Daniel?
Anyway look at that...
And she' s already Sergeant.
- Ho, ho.
You' re done whining?
You already started digging your grave.
She' s not lady charity.
An engine like her doesn' t work with low grade oil.
What she needs is a MAN.
You look more like an monkey now.
Stand up straight!
Now you go see her and you kiss her and that' s it.
You either get a slap in the face or you get her for at least 10 years.
There' s a 50/ 50 chance.
If it doesn' t work at least you' il know.
It' s like a game show, either you get it or you don' t.
Are you alright?
We shouldn' t worry like that.
I' il go for it.
I got it.
- He' il have other chances.
- Where are we with the keys?
- Done!
You think they' re going to be mad?
If a girl shows up 17 hours late, what would you do?
- I kill her.
- So you got your answer!
But we' ve got flowers here.
- Oh the nice flowers!
- Can we smoke them?
- Yes.
Since we both didn' t get any love, we got our revenge on the cakes.
What a crisis!
I had a wonderful day.
Are the flowers for me?
Thanks, goodbye.
You don' t want to have a intimate evening?
You' ve got visitors, Daniel.
We' il do it an other day, we' re not short of time.
Camille will sleep in your bed, her back hurts.
Good night boys.
- Man this is good stuff.
- Sure, it' s Jamaican.
- You see, it' s not so bad in the forces.
- Stop it, you' re tempting me.
Tell me, why didn' t you race directly instead of doing it with a taxi?
My father spent his life in a wheelchair because of a car accident.
How could I explain him that I wanted to be a race car driver?
- And you?
How did you end up where you are?
My story isn' t bad either.
My dad died when I was 17, my mother and I were alone.
So I had to go to work right away.
And without a degree, only the cops wants you.
- Where did you live?
- In Asnières.
- In Jules Ferry?
Why?
- You too?
- Yes, I swear.
It' s crazy, we could have ended up in the same class.
I would have taught you to steal bikes and you wouldn' t have turned out so bad!
Life' s like that, you dream about so many things when you' re a kid and in the end...... nothing goes as planned.
You dream of playing forward and you end up a goalie.
Do you think our plan will work, Daniel?
It will work.
Are you sure?
Come in.
Am I disturbing you?
No, I' m fine now.
What do you need?
Red Alert!
Guys, the cougar' s plan has started.
It' s the S. D. L. M. banks.
Here are you positions for today.
Arthur, at the crossroads Nº 1.
Jacky, Nº 2,...... at National Flamarion crossroads.
Momo at the crossroads de Le Beché.
Nº 2, radio and key.
Nº 4...
- Yes, I know you' il come back in 1 hour.
I' il wait for you at your place.
Cougar speaking The bird is in the cage.
On your knees!
The bird will soon leave his cage.
Prepare yourselves.
- Sorry, no more room for you.
- Ok, no problem.
You' re going to run next to the car.
It won' t be bad for you.
I' m tired!
All cougar units get out!
Catch the bird!
You see it' s not the Mercedes we needed to follow... it' s the Mercedes truck we needed to follow.
This calls for a toast!
Cheers!
It' s a go.
- Everything ready?
- 20 strategic points blocked.
If they cross any of these diagonals they' re caught like rats.
If they take Michelet boulevard, they' il end up at place Mazard.
Who' s on that corner?
- Call him, he' il be the opening act.
You hear me?
- Yes, I' m here.
- You' il be the first, are you in position?
- Yes, no problem.
- So it' s our turn now.
- Yes, yes.
Still driving the tractor?
Sorry about last time.
I forgot I had the handbrake on, that' s why I didn' t go very fast.
- Do we race again or are you staying the losers?
- Ok.
You french always have such big mouths.
- Come onto the highway with me, we' il see!
- I' m going blow up your Peugeot!
I' il give you an other chance, but I' il try harder this time.
I feel cheap taking money from you so easily.
Here you go darling, 10 francs.
- You' re going to pay for your insolence.
- Better to be insolent than ridiculous!
- I think you overdid it a bit.
Tell 7, 8 and 9 to go to red.
Jean- Bat, go to red now.
- Nº 10, in position.
- Nº 11, in position.
12 and 13, prepare yourselves.
I' ve got a small problem here.
- There are 2 cops at the traffic light.
- Get rid of them!
- Easy to say!
Otherwise, we' re finished.
Pollo, let me talk to the cops.
Sorry sir, it' s for you.
- Hello.
- This is Sergeant Gibert, we' ve found a bomb and it' s just next to you.
- Where?
- In the traffic light.
Stay calm, we know how to stop the mechanism.
Listen carefully: put the key in the light and make the light turn red.
- It' s already red!
- Don' t worry about the colour!... just turn the key to the right!
Yes, yes, Sergeant.
- We just passed 12.
- Hurry up, hurry up!
Can I do it?
- 19 and 20, get ready.
After 20, there' s nothing.
- I know.
- It' s a shortcut.
On the highway, they' re dead.
We' ve got more power.
- If there was a fence, maybe there was a reason.
- Yep, the highway isn' t finished, it' s a dead end.
The important thing is that you know it.
- I look calm like but in fact I' m not.
- It won' t be long.
- That' s what worries me, I want to live long!
Take that frog!
- We' ve got to stop, there' s no bridge!
Take him!
Let them win, Daniel!
- I don' t want to die for 10 francs!
Hold on!!!
Way to go, Karl!
We won!
Are you sure?
I swear, you scared me to death!
I really thought you would rather die than lose.
Between the tortoise and the hare it' s always the tortoise that wins!
Einstein!
You know "La Fontaine"?
Big hare not happy to been fucked by little Tortoise.
Cougar will be happy.
For a long time he' s wanted to eat hare.
I' m sorry about the place.
It' s not very romantic.
- Oh really?
I didn' t feel it.
Should we try again?
No, later.
We' ve really got to go now.
Daniel, What are you doing?
I' ve been looking for you for 15 minutes.
- What were you doing in the dark?
- Photo finishing.
The sergeant is waiting!
In the name of the president of the Republic...... it is an honour to offer you the medal of the knight.
Congratulations.
- I owe you an apology.
Both.
How can you forgive me?
We' il find a way.
I read the story of your exploits.
Amazing!
This experience made us think.
We are going to implement a police force more efficient and modern.
- Thank you.
It won' t give you your license back.
- I was hoping for more...
- Exactly.
We' ve got enough to put you in jail for many years... but you are free.
- I' m not free, I can' t drive.
- I understand.
Without a car, you are like an orphan.
- Yes, an orphan on foot.
- I understand.
I got a solution but I' m not sure it will suit you.
Tell me, and we' il see.
- Yes.
- You' re not happy?
- Yes it' s great.
I don' t understand.
-... your girlfriend.
What' s wrong?
- The sponsor!
We find him money, a car and he' s still not happy.
Tell the cheerleader to stop moving, it distracts me.
- You know what you could do that would make me happy?
Because we don' t give a damn about the sponsors on the car.
It' s not good too cold.
- Is everything in place?
- You weren' t supposed to relieve me.
I know, but I felt like taking a shift.
You like him, don' t you?
You like watching him.
- Don' t be ridiculous.
You understand?
Morpheus believes he is the One.
Do you?
It doesn' t matter what I believe.
You don' t, do you?
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?
Are you sure this line is clean?
- Freeze!
- Hands on your head!
Do it!
Lieutenant.
Oh, shit.
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders.
I' m just doing my job.
You give me that "juris- my- dick- tion" crap, you can cram it up your ass.
The orders were for your protection.
I think we can handle one little girl.
I sent two units!
They' re bringing her down now!
Shit.
Morpheus, the line was traced.
I don' t know how.
They cut the hard line.
Get to another exit.
Are there any agents?
Yes.
You have to focus, Trinity.
There' s a phone at Wells and Lake.
- All right.
- Go.
That' s impossible.
Get up, Trinity.
Just get up.
She got out.
It doesn' t matter.
The informant is real.
We have the name of their next target.
The name is Neo.
We' il need a search running.
It has already begun.
What?
What the hell?
"Follow the white rabbit".
Who is it?
It' s Choi.
I know.
It' s her fault.
You got the money?
Two grand.
Hold on.
Hallelujah.
You' re my savior.
This never happened.
- Right.
- Something wrong, man?
You look a little whiter than usual.
My computer, it....
Ever have that feeling where you' re not sure if you' re awake or dreaming?
All the time.
It' s called mescaline.
It' s the only way to fly.
It just sounds like you need to unplug.
Get some R and R?
What do you think, Dujour?
Should we take him with us?
No, I can' t.
Come on.
It' il be fun.
Yeah.
Sure.
I' il go.
Hello, Neo.
How do you know that name?
Who are you?
My name is Trinity.
The Trinity?
That cracked the lRS D- base?
That was a long time ago.
Jesus.
What?
I just thought... you were a guy.
Most guys do.
That was you on my computer.
How did you do that?
Right now, all I can tell you... is that you' re in danger.
- I brought you here to warn you.
They' re watching you, Neo.
Who is?
Please just listen.
I know why you' re here, Neo.
I know what you' ve been doing.
I know why you hardly sleep... why you live alone and why, night after night... you sit at your computer.
You' re looking for him.
I know, because I was once looking for the same thing.
I was looking for an answer.
It' s the question that drives us, Neo.
It' s the question that brought you here.
You know the question... just as I did.
What is the Matrix?
The answer is out there, Neo.
Shit.
You have a problem with authority, Mr. Anderson.
You believe that you are special, that the rules do not apply to you.
Obviously, you are mistaken.
This is one of the top software companies in the world... because employees understand they are part of a whole.
Thus, if an employee has a problem, the company has a problem.
The time has come to make a choice, Mr. Anderson.
Either you choose to be at your desk on time from this day forth... or you choose to find another job.
Do I make myself clear?
Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.
Thomas Anderson?
Yeah, that' s me.
Great.
Have a nice day.
Hello, Neo.
Do you know who this is?
- Morpheus.
I' ve been looking for you.
But unfortunately, you and I have run out of time.
They' re coming for you, and I don' t know what they' re going to do.
Who' s coming for me?
Stand up and see for yourself.
What?
Right now?
Now.
Oh, shit!
I don' t know.
If you don' t want to find out, get out of there.
How?
I can guide you, but you must do exactly as I say.
The cubicle across from you is empty.
- But what if they..
Now.
Stay here forjust a moment.
When I tell you, go to the end of the row... to the office at the end of the hall.
Go.
Now.
Good.
Now, outside there is a scaffold.
- How do you know this?
- We don' t have time.
To your left there' s a window.
Go to it.
Open it.
Take the scaffold to the roof.
No way!
This is crazy!
There are two ways out of this building.
The other is in their custody.
You take a chance either way.
I leave it to you.
This is insane!
Why is this happening to me?
What' d I do?
I' m nobody.
I didn' t do anything.
I' m gonna die.
Shit!
I can' t do this.
Shit.
As you can see, we' ve had our eye on you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.
It seems that you' ve been living... two lives.
ln one life, you' re Thomas A. Anderson... program writer for a respectable software company.
You have a social security number.
You pay your taxes.
And you... help your landlady carry out her garbage.
The other life is lived in computers... where you go by the hacker alias "Neo"... and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for.
One of these lives... has a future.
And one of them does not.
I' m going to be as forthcoming as I can be, Mr. Anderson.
You' re here... because we need your help.
We know that you' ve been contacted by a certain... individual.
A man who calls himself "Morpheus".
Whatever you think you know about this man is irrelevant.
He is considered by many authorities... to be the most dangerous man alive.
My colleagues... believe that I am wasting my time with you.
But I believe you wish to do the right thing.
We' re willing to wipe the slate clean... give you a fresh start.
All we' re asking in return is your cooperation... in bringing a known terrorist to justice.
That sounds like a really good deal.
How about...
I give you the finger... and you give me my phone call.
Mr. Anderson...
you disappoint me.
You can' t scare me with this gestapo crap.
I know my rights.
I want my phone call.
Tell me, Mr. Anderson... what good is a phone call... if you' re unable to speak?
You' re going to help us, Mr. Anderson... whether you want to... or not.
This line is tapped, so I must be brief.
They got to you first, but they' ve underestimated how important you are.
If they knew what I know... you would probably be dead.
What are you talking about?
What is happening to me?
You are the One, Neo.
You may have spent the last few years...
looking for you.
Now, do you still want to meet?
- Yes.
- Then go to the Adams Street bridge.
What' s this?
It' s necessary, Neo.
For our protection.
From what?
From you.
Take off your shirt.
Stop the car.
Listen, coppertop.
We don' t have time for 2O Questions.
Our way... or the highway.
Fine.
Please, Neo, you have to trust me.
- Why?
- Because you have been down there.
You know that road.
You know exactly where it ends.
And I know that' s not where you want to be.
Apoc, lights.
Lie back.
Lift up your shirt.
What' s that?
You' re bugged.
Try and relax.
Come on.
Come on.
It' s on the move.
- You' re gonna lose it.
- No, I' m not.
Clear!
Jesus Christ!
That thing' s real?!
Let me give you one piece of advice.
Be honest.
He knows more than you can imagine.
At last.
Welcome, Neo.
I am Morpheus.
It' s an honor to meet you.
No... the honor is mine.
Please, come.
Sit.
I imagine... that right now you' re feeling a bit like Alice... tumbling down the rabbit hole?
You could say that.
I can see it in your eyes.
You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees... because he' s expecting to wake up.
lronically, this is not far from the truth.
Do you believe in fate, Neo?
No.
Why not?
I don' t like the idea that I' m not in control of my life.
I know exactly what you mean.
Let me tell you why you' re here.
You know something.
But you feel it.
You felt it your entire life.
Something' s wrong with the world.
You don' t know what, but it' s there.
Like a splinter in your mind... driving you mad.
It is this feeling that has brought you to me.
Do you know what I' m talking about?
The Matrix?
Do you want to know... what it is?
It is all around us.
Even now, in this very room.
You can see it when you look out your window... or when you turn on your television.
You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes.
It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes... to blind you from the truth.
What truth?
That you are a slave.
Like everyone else, you were born into bondage... born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch.
A prison... for your mind.
Unfortunately, no one can be... told what the Matrix is.
You have to see it for yourself.
This is your last chance.
After this, there is no turning back.
You take the blue pill... the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe... whatever you want to believe.
You take the red pill... you stay in Wonderland... and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.
Remember... all I' m offering is the truth.
Nothing more.
Follow me.
Apoc, are we on- line?
Almost.
Time is always against us.
Please take a seat there.
You did all this?
The pill you took is part of a trace program.
It disrupts your carrier signals so we can pinpoint your location.
What does that mean?
It means buckle your seat belt, Dorothy... because Kansas... is going bye- bye.
Did you?
Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real?
What if you were unable to wake from that dream?
How would you know the difference between the dream world... and the real world?
This can' t be.
Be what?
Be real?
Going into replication.
It' s cold.
It' s cold!
Tank, we' il need a signal soon.
I got a fibrillation.
Apoc, location.
Targeting almost there.
He' s going into arrest.
I got him!
Now, Tank, now!
Welcome... to the real world.
We' ve done it, Trinity.
We found him.
- I hope you' re right.
- I don' t have to hope.
I know it.
Am I dead?
Far from it.
He still needs a lot of work.
What are you doing?
We' re rebuilding them.
Why do my eyes hurt?
You' ve never used them before.
Rest, Neo.
Morpheus, what' s happened to me?
What is this place?
More important than "what" is "when".
When?
You believe it' s the year 1999... when in fact, it' s closer to 2199.
I can' t tell you exactly what year it is... because we honestly don' t know.
There' s nothing I can say that will explain it for you.
Come with me.
This is my ship.
It' s a hovercraft.
This is the main deck.
This is the core... where we broadcast our pirate signal and hack into the Matrix.
This is Apoc...
Switch... and Cypher.
The ones you don' t know:
Tank and his big brother, Dozer.
The little one behind you is Mouse.
You wanted to know what the Matrix is?
Trinity.
Try to relax.
This will feel a little weird.
This... is the Construct.
It' s our loading program.
We can load anything, from clothing... to equipment... weapons... training simulations... anything we need.
Right now we' re inside a computer program?
ls it really so hard to believe?
The plugs in your body are gone.
Your appearance now is what we call "residual self- image".
It is the mental projection of your digital self.
What is "real"?
How do you define "real"?
If you' re talking about what you can feel... what you can smell, taste and see... then "real" is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
This is the world that you know.
The world as it was at the end of the 2Oth century.
It exists now only as part of a neural- interactive simulation... that we call the Matrix.
You' ve been living in a dream world, Neo.
This is the world... as it exists today.
Welcome to "the desert... of the real".
But what we know for certain is that in the early 21st century... all of mankind was united in celebration.
Al.
You mean artificial intelligence.
A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines.
We don' t know who struck first, us or them.
But we know that it was us that scorched the sky.
They were dependent on solar power... and it was believed that they would be unable to survive... without an energy source as abundant as the sun.
Throughout human history, we have been dependent on machines to survive.
Fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony.
And over 25, OOO BTUs of body heat.
Combined with a form of fusion... the machines had found all the energy they would ever need.
There are fields, Neo, endless fields... where human beings are no longer born.
We are grown.
For the longest time, I wouldn' t believe it.
And then I saw the fields with my own eyes... watched them liquefy the dead... so they could be fed intravenously to the living.
And standing there, facing the pure, horrifying precision...
What is the Matrix?
Control.
The Matrix is a computer- generated dream world... built to keep us under control... in order to change a human being... into this.
No.
I don' t believe it.
It' s not possible.
I didn' t say it would be easy, Neo.
I just said it would be the truth.
Stop!
Let me out!
I want out!
Easy.
- Get this thing out of me.
Get this thing out of me!
Don' t touch me!
Stay away from me!
- He' s gonna pop.
- Breathe, Neo.
I can' t go back, can I?
No.
But if you could... would you really want to?
I owe you an apology.
We have a rule.
We never free a mind once it' s reached a certain age.
It' s dangerous.
The mind has trouble letting go.
I' ve seen it before, and I' m sorry.
I had to.
When the Matrix was first built, there was a man born inside... who had the ability to change whatever he wanted... to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.
It was he who freed the first of us... taught us the truth.
As long as the Matrix exists... the human race will never be free.
After he died... the Oracle prophesied his return... and that his coming would hail the destruction of the Matrix... end the war... bring freedom to our people.
That is why there are those of us who spent our lives searching the Matrix...
looking for him.
I believe that search is over.
Get some rest.
For what?
Your training.
Morning.
Did you sleep?
You will tonight.
I guarantee it.
I' il be your operator.
- You don' t have any..
- Holes?
Me and my brother, Dozer, are 1OO% pure, old- fashioned, homegrown human.
Born free right here... in the real world.
- Zion?
- If the war was over tomorrow...
Zion' s where the party would be.
It' s a city?
Deep underground... near the Earth' s core, where it' s still warm.
You live long enough, you might see it.
Goddamn!
I gotta tell you, I' m excited to see what you' re capable of... if Morpheus is right and all.
We got a lot to do.
We gotta get to it.
We' re supposed to start with these programs first.
That' s major boring shit.
Let' s do something more fun.
How about... combat training?
"Jujitsu"?
I' m going to learn jujitsu?
Holy shit!
"Hey, Mikey, I think he likes it".
How about some more?
Hell, yeah.
How is he?
Ten hours straight.
He' s a machine.
I know kung fu.
Show me.
This is a sparring program... similar to the programmed reality of the Matrix.
Like gravity.
These rules are no different than those of a computer system.
Some of them can be bent.
Others... can be broken.
Understand?
Good!
lmprovisation.
But your weakness... is not your technique.
Morpheus is fighting Neo.
How did I beat you?
You' re too fast.
Do you believe that... my being stronger or faster... has anything to do with my muscles in this place?
You think you' re breathing air?
Again!
Jesus Christ, he' s fast!
His neuro- kinetics are way above normal.
What are you waiting for?
You' re faster than this.
Don' t think you are.
Know you are.
Stop trying to hit me, and hit me!
I don' t believe it.
I know what you' re trying to do.
But I can only show you the door.
You have to walk through it.
Tank, load the jump program.
You have to let it all go, Neo.
Fear... doubt and disbelief.
Free your mind.
Okey- dokey.
Free my mind.
What if he makes it?
- No one' s ever made their first jump.
- But what if he does?
- He won' t.
All right.
Free my mind.
Free my mind.
What does that mean?
It doesn' t mean anything.
Everybody falls the first time.
Right, Trin?
- I thought it wasn' t real.
- Your mind makes it real.
If you' re killed in the Matrix... you die here?
The body cannot live without the mind.
I don' t remember you ever bringing me dinner.
There is something about him, isn' t there?
You' re a believer now?
I keep wondering... if Morpheus is so sure, why not take him to see the Oracle?
Morpheus will take him when he' s ready.
The Matrix is a system, Neo.
That system is our enemy.
But when you' re inside, what do you see?
Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters.
The very minds of the people we are trying to save.
But until we do, these people are a part of that system... and that makes them our enemy.
You have to understand... most of these people are not ready to be unplugged.
And many of them are so inert... so hopelessly dependent on the system... so hopelessly dependent on the system... that they will fight to protect it.
Were you listening to me or looking at the woman in the red dress?
Look again.
Freeze it.
This isn' t the Matrix?
It' s another training program designed to teach you one thing:
If you are not one of us, you are one of them.
- What are they?
- Sentient programs.
They can move in and out of any software still hardwired to their system.
That means that anyone we haven' t unplugged... is potentially an agent.
Inside the Matrix... they are everyone... and they are no one.
We have survived by hiding and running from them... but they are the gatekeepers.
They' re guarding all the doors and holding all the keys.
Sooner or later, someone will have to fight them.
Someone?
I won' t lie to you, Neo.
Every single man or woman who has fought an agent has died.
But where they have failed, you will succeed.
Why?
I' ve seen an agent punch through a concrete wall.
Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit nothing but air.
Yet their strength and speed are still based in a world built on rules.
Because of that... they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be.
What are you telling me?
That I can dodge bullets?
No, Neo.
I' m trying to tell you that when you' re ready... you won' t have to.
We got trouble.
Did Zion send the warning?
No, another ship.
Shit.
Squiddy?
A sentinel.
A killing machine designed for one thing.
Search and destroy.
Set her down there.
How are we doing, Tank?
EMP armed... and ready.
Electromagnetic pulse.
Disables any electrical system in the blast radius.
It' s the only weapon we have against the machines.
Where are we?
Their old service and waste systems.
Sewers.
There used to be cities that spanned hundreds of miles.
Now these sewers are all that' s left.
Quiet.
You scared the bejesus out of me.
- Sorry.
- It' s okay.
Is that..?
The Matrix?
- Do you always look at it encoded?
- Well, you have to.
But there' s way too much information to decode the Matrix.
You get used to it.
I don' t even see the code.
All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead.
Do you... want a drink?
Sure.
I know what you' re thinking.
Because right now I' m thinking the same thing.
Why, oh, why didn' t I take the blue pill?
Good shit, huh?
It' s good for two things:
Degreasing engines and killing brain cells.
So can I ask you something?
Did he tell you why he did it?
Why you' re here?
Jesus!
What a mind job.
So you' re here to save the world.
What do you say to something like that?
A little piece of advice.
You see an agent... you do what we do:
Run.
You run your ass off.
Thanks for the drink.
Sweet dreams.
Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?
I know this steak doesn' t exist.
I know that when I put it in my mouth... the Matrix is telling my brain that it is... juicy... and delicious.
After nine years... you know what I realize?
Ignorance is bliss.
Then we have a deal.
I don' t want to remember nothing.
Nothing.
And I want to be rich.
You know, someone important.
Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.
I' il get you what you want.
No.
I told you, I don' t know them.
I can get you the man who does.
Morpheus.
Here you go, buddy.
Breakfast of champions.
Close your eyes, it feels like you' re eating runny eggs.
Or a bowl of snot.
You know what it reminds me of?
Tastee Wheat.
Did you ever eat Tastee Wheat?
No, but technically, neither did you.
Exactly.
Because you have to wonder... how do the machines really know what Tastee Wheat tasted like?
Maybe they got it wrong.
Maybe what I think Tastee Wheat tasted like actually tasted like... oatmeal or tuna fish.
That makes you wonder.
Take chicken, for example.
- And maybe they..
- Shut up.
Everything the body needs.
It doesn' t have everything the body needs.
I understand you' ve run through the agent training program.
You know, I wrote that program.
Here it comes.
- What did you think of her?
- Of who?
The woman in the red dress.
I designed her.
She doesn' t talk very much... but if you' d like to meet her, I can arrange a more personal milieu.
The digital pimp hard at work.
Pay no attention to these hypocrites, Neo.
To deny our own impulses... is to deny the very thing that makes us human.
Dozer, when you' re done... bring the ship up to broadcast depth.
We' re going in.
I' m taking Neo to see her.
See who?
The Oracle.
Everyone, please observe... the "fasten seat belt" and "no smoking" signs are on.
Sit back and enjoy your flight.
We' re in.
We' il be back in an hour.
Unbelievable... isn' t it?
- God!
- What?
I used to eat there.
Really good noodles.
I have these memories from my life.
None of them happened.
What does that mean?
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
But an oracle can?
That' s different.
Did you go to her?
Yes.
What did she tell you?
She told me....
What?
We' re here.
Come with me.
So is this the same oracle that made... the prophecy?
Yes.
She' s very old.
She' s been with us since the beginning.
The beginning?
Of the Resistance.
And she knows what?
Everything?
She would say she knows enough.
And she' s never wrong.
Try not to think of it in terms of right and wrong.
She is a guide, Neo.
She helped you?
What did she tell you?
That I would find the One.
I told you I can only show you the door.
You have to walk through it.
Hello, Neo.
You' re right on time.
Make yourself at home, Morpheus.
Neo, come with me.
These are the other Potentials.
You can wait here.
Do not try and bend the spoon.
That' s impossible.
lnstead, only try to realize the truth.
What truth?
There is no spoon.
There is no spoon?
Then you' il see that it is not the spoon that bends.
It is only yourself.
The Oracle will you see now.
I know you' re Neo.
Be right with you.
You' re the Oracle?
Bingo.
Not quite what you were expecting, right?
Almost done.
Smell good, don' t they?
I' d ask you to sit down... but you' re not going to anyway.
And don' t worry about the vase.
What vase?
I' m sorry.
I said, don' t worry about it.
I' il get one of my kids to fix it.
How did you know?
What' s really going to bake your noodle later on is... would you still have broken it if I hadn' t said anything?
You' re cuter than I thought.
I can see why she likes you.
Who?
Not too bright, though.
You know why Morpheus brought you to see me.
So... what do you think?
Do you think you are the One?
I don' t know.
You know what that means?
It' s Latin.
Means, "Know thyself".
I' il let you in on a little secret.
Being the One is just like being in love.
No one can tell you you' re in love.
Balls to bones.
I' d better have a look at you.
Say, "Ah".
Okay....
Now I' m supposed to say, "Hmm, that' s interesting, but..."
Then you say:
But what?
But you already know what I' m going to tell you.
I' m not the One.
Sorry, kid.
You got the gift, but it looks like you' re waiting for something.
What?
Your next life, maybe.
Who knows?
That' s the way these things go.
What' s funny?
Morpheus.
He almost had me convinced.
I know.
Poor Morpheus.
Without him, we' re lost.
What do you mean, "without him"?
Are you sure you want to hear this?
Morpheus believes in you, Neo.
And no one, not you, not even me... can convince him otherwise.
He believes it so blindly... that he' s going to sacrifice his life to save yours.
What?
You' re going to have to make a choice.
And in the other hand, you' il have your own.
One of you is going to die.
Which one will be up to you.
I really am.
You have a good soul.
And I hate giving good people bad news.
Don' t worry about it.
As soon as you step outside that door... you' il start feeling better.
You' il remember you don' t believe in any of this fate crap.
You' re in control of your own life.
Remember?
I promise, by the time you' re done eating it... you' il feel right as rain.
What was said... was for you... and for you alone.
They' re on the way.
What is that?
Oh, deja vu.
What did you just say?
Nothing.
Just deja vu.
- What did you see?
- What happened?
A black cat went past us... then another just like it.
Was it the same cat?
I' m not sure.
Switch, Apoc.
What is it?
A deja vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix when they change something.
Oh, my God.
They cut the hard line.
Get out!
Oh, no.
That' s what they changed.
We' re trapped.
Be calm.
Give me your phone.
They' il be able to track it.
We have no choice.
Find a structural drawing of this building.
- Got it!
Eighth floor.
They' re on the eighth floor.
Switch, straight ahead.
Now left.
That' s it.
Good.
Where are they?
They' re in the walls.
ln the walls!
It' s an agent!
You must get Neo out!
He' s all that matters!
Don' t!
Trinity, go!
Go!
- We can' t leave him!
- We have to!
Come on!
The great Morpheus.
We meet at last.
And you are?
A Smith.
Agent Smith.
You all look the same to me.
Take him.
- Operator.
- I need an exit, fast.
There was an accident.
Goddamn car accident.
All of a sudden, boom.
I got you.
Just get me out of here fast.
Nearest exit, Franklin and Erie.
Right.
- Operator.
- Tank, it' s me.
Is Morpheus alive?
Is Morpheus alive, Tank?
Yes.
I don' t know where.
He' s alive.
We need an exit.
- Cypher?
- I know.
Got him.
Where are they?
Making the call.
Good.
You first.
Shit!
It just went dead.
Hello, Trinity.
Where' s Tank?
I thought I was in love with you.
I used to dream about you.
You' re a beautiful woman, Trinity.
Too bad things had to turn out this way.
You killed them.
- What?
- Oh, God.
I' m tired, Trinity.
I' m tired of this war... tired of fighting.
I' m tired of this ship... of being cold, of eating the same goddamn goop every day.
But most of all...
I' m tired of that jackoff and all of his bullshit.
Surprise, asshole!
I bet you never saw this coming... did you?
God, I wish I could be there... when they break you.
You gave them Morpheus.
He lied to us, Trinity.
He tricked us!
That is not true, Cypher.
"Free".
You call this free?
All I do is what he tells me to do.
If I had to choose between that and the Matrix...
The Matrix isn' t real.
I disagree, Trinity.
I think the Matrix... can be more real than this world.
But there... you have to watch Apoc die.
Welcome to the real world.
But you' re out.
- You can' t go back.
- That' s what you think.
They' il reinsert my body.
I go back to sleep.
When I wake up, I won' t remember a thing.
By the way... if you have anything important to say to Switch... say it now.
No, please don' t.
Not like this.
Not like this.
Goddamn you, Cypher!
Don' t hate me, Trinity.
I' m just a messenger.
And right now, I' m going to prove it to you.
If Morpheus was right... there' s no way I can pull this plug.
If Neo' s the One... then there' d have to be... some kind of a miracle to stop me.
I mean, how can he be the One... if he' s dead?
Come on.
All I want is a little yes or no.
Look into his eyes... those big, pretty eyes... and tell me... yes... or no.
Yes.
I don' t believe it.
Believe it or not, you piece of shit, you' re still going to burn!
You first.
You' re hurt.
I' il be all right.
Dozer?
Have you ever stood and stared at it?
Billions of people... just living out their lives.
Did you know that the first Matrix... was designed to be a perfect human world where none suffered... where everyone would be happy.
It was a disaster.
Entire crops were lost.
Some believe that... we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world.
But I believe that... as a species... human beings define their reality through misery... and suffering.
So the perfect world was a dream... that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from.
Which is why the Matrix was redesigned to this.
The peak... of your civilization.
I say, "your civilization"... because when we started thinking for you, it became our civilization... which is, of course, what this is all about.
Evolution, Morpheus.
Evolution.
Like the dinosaur.
Look out that window.
You had your time.
The future is our world, Morpheus.
The future is our time.
There could be a problem.
- What are they doing to him?
- They' re breaking into his mind.
All it takes is time.
How much time?
But eventually, it' il crack... and his alpha patterns will change from this to this.
When it does, he' il tell them anything they want to know.
What do they want?
The leader of every ship is given codes to Zion' s mainframe computer.
If an agent got the codes and got into Zion' s mainframe... they could destroy us.
We can' t let that happen.
Zion' s more important than me... or you... or even Morpheus.
There has to be something we can do.
There is.
You' re going to kill him?
Kill Morpheus?
We don' t have a choice.
Never send a human to do a machine' s job.
If the insider has failed... they' il sever the connection as soon as possible, unless..
They' re dead. ln either case..
We have no choice.
Continue as planned.
Immediately.
Morpheus, you were more than a leader to us.
You were a father.
We' il miss you always.
Stop!
- Neo, this has to be done.
- Does it?
I don' t know.
This can' t be just coincidence.
What?
She told me this would happen.
She told me that I would have to make a choice.
What choice?
What are you doing?
I' m going in.
No, you' re not.
I have to.
Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself so that we could get you out.
There is no way that you' re going back in.
Morpheus did what he did because he believed I' m something I' m not.
I' m not the One, Trinity.
- The Oracle hit me with that too.
- No, you have to be.
I' m sorry, I' m not.
I' m just another guy.
No, Neo, that' s not true.
It can' t be true.
Why?
This is loco.
They' ve got Morpheus in a military- controlled building.
Three of them.
I want Morpheus back too, but what you' re talking about is suicide.
That' s what it looks like... but it' s not.
I can' t explain to you why it' s not.
Morpheus believed something, and he was ready to give his life for it.
I understand that now.
That' s why I have to go.
Why?
Because I believe in something.
What?
I believe I can bring him back.
- What are you doing?
- Going with you.
No, you' re not.
"No"?
Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.
I believe if you are serious about saving him, you will need my help.
And since I am the ranking officer... if you don' t like it, I believe you can go to hell.
Because you aren' t going anywhere else.
load us up.
I' d like to share a revelation that I' ve had... during my time here.
It came to me when I tried to classify your species... and I realized... that you' re not actually mammals.
Every mammal on this planet... instinctively develops an equilibrium with the surrounding environment.
But you humans do not.
You move to an area and you multiply... and multiply until every natural resource is consumed.
The only way you can survive... is to spread to another area.
There is another organism on this planet... that follows the same pattern.
Do you know what it is?
A virus.
A cancer of this planet.
And we... are the cure.
Okay, so what do you need?
Besides a miracle.
Guns.
Lots of guns.
No one has ever done anything like this.
That' s why it' s going to work.
Why isn' t the serum working?
Perhaps we' re asking the wrong questions.
Leave me with him.
Now.
Hold on, Morpheus.
They' re coming for you.
They' re coming.
Can you hear me, Morpheus?
I' m going to be honest... with you.
I... hate... this place... this zoo... this prison... this reality, whatever you want to call it.
I can' t stand it any longer.
If there is such a thing.
I feel saturated by it.
I can... taste... your stink.
And every time I do, I fear that I have somehow been infected by it.
It' s repulsive.
Isn' t it?
I must get out of here.
I must get free.
And in this mind is the key.
My key.
Once Zion is destroyed, there is no need for me to be here.
Do you understand?
I need the codes.
I have to get inside Zion... and you have to tell me how.
You' re going to tell me... or you' re going to die.
Please remove any metallic items you' re carrying.
Keys, loose change.
Please remove any metallic items you' re carrying.
Keys, loose change.
Holy shit!
Send backup.
Freeze!
What were you doing?
He doesn' t know.
Know what?
I think they' re trying to save him.
There is no spoon.
Find them and destroy them!
We' re under attack!
Only human.
- How did you do that?
- Do what?
You moved like they do.
I' ve never seen anyone move that fast.
It wasn' t fast enough.
Can you fly that thing?
Not yet.
Operator.
I need a pilot program for a B- 212 helicopter.
Hurry.
Let' s go.
No.
Morpheus, get up.
Get up, get up.
He' s not going to make it.
Got you.
I knew it.
He' s the One.
Do you believe it now, Trinity?
The Oracle.
- She told me..
- She told you... what you needed to hear.
That' s all.
Sooner or later you' il realize, just as I did... there' s a difference between knowing the path... and walking the path.
Operator.
- It' s good to hear your voice.
- We need an exit.
Subway station, State and Balboa.
Damn it!
The trace was completed.
We have their position.
Sentinels are standing by.
Order the strike.
They' re not out yet.
You first, Morpheus.
Neo, I want to tell you something... but I' m afraid of what it could mean if I do.
Everything the Oracle told me has come true.
Everything but this.
But what?
- What happened?
- An agent.
Send me back.
I can' t.
Mr. Anderson.
Run, Neo.
Run.
What is he doing?
He' s beginning to believe.
You' re empty.
So are you.
Mr. Anderson.
Jesus, he' s killing him.
You hear that, Mr. Anderson?
That is the sound of inevitability.
It is the sound of your death.
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.
My name... is Neo.
- What happened?
I lost him.
- How long?
- Five, maybe six minutes.
Tank, charge the EMP.
- We can' t use that until he' s out.
- I know.
He' s gonna make it.
Flat or pumps?
No, just..
What the shit?
That guy took my phone!
Got him!
He' s on the run.
I got an old exit.
Wabash and Lake.
Oh, shit!
Need a little help!
The door.
The door on your left.
Your other left!
The back door.
Oh, no.
Here they come.
He' s going to make it.
The fire escape at the end of the alley, room 303.
They' re inside.
Hurry, Neo.
It can' t be.
Check him.
He' s gone.
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.
Neo, I' m not afraid anymore.
I' d fall in love in a dead man and that the man I loved would be the One.
So you see... you can' t be dead.
You can' t be... because I love you.
You hear me?
I love you.
Now, get up.
No.
How?
He is the One.
I know yor' re out there.
I can feel you now.
I know that you' re afraid.
You' re afraid of change.
I don' t know the future.
I didn' t come here to tell you how this is going to end.
I came here to tell you how it' s going to begin.
I' il hang up this phone.
And then I' il show these people what you don' t want them to see.
I' m going to show them a world... without you.
A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries.
A world where anything is possible.
Where we go from there... is a choice I leave to you.
Ashraf N. El Gabry Gabry@ Email. com
Yes, sir.
Gentlemen, we owe a quarterly.
Vault 23, encryption download.
Loaded.
Sonic, please.
Stable.
Motion.
Stable.
Status check, please.
Excellent.
Carry on, gentlemen.
- Come on.
- What' re you doing, man?
All right, we' re here.
What restaurant is this?
Where the front door at?
It' s like VlP, you know?
Only cool people go in the back, like Madonna...... and Dennis Rodman and Gary Coleman.
It' s real controversial stars coming in this place.
All right.
I' m not doing it.
We' il get a couple of grand.
Look.
You been casing it and got one picture?
Film is expensive.
Shrimp?
You on parole and you here trying to go back for stealing shrimp?
Not shrimps, baby.
What the fuck is a prawn?
You ever order a jumbo shrimp cocktail?
That' s prawns.
Eating one prawn, that' s like five or six shrimp.
Yeah, right.
I' m going back to the truck.
Fredo did the same thing to Michael in The Godfather.
Get the fuck out here! "
You' re deviating.
Give me a second.
We don' t have a second.
Go back to the truck.
I' il finish up here.
Glove.
Ninety seconds.
Send down the lift.
What?
What are you talking about?
No fucking guns!
You listen to me, Jaster.
You send down that fucking lift!
- What are you doing?
No!
Wait.
Wait!
Crazy motherfucker!
No!
Stop!
You fucking nuts?
No.
I' m fine.
Thanks for your concern.
- What the hell is wrong with him?
- Hold on.
He' s really disrespecting my speed right now.
Disrespecting your speed?
Where' s a nice, slow rottweiler when you need him?
You cased it for months and didn' t see a 200- pound dog?
They was puppies when I saw them.
On three, you go right, I' il go left.
I go wrong all the time.
I' m going right.
Okay, brother, whatever.
Gotta hurry.
Yeah, what you want now, huh?
It' s me and you, baby.
It can just be you.
How long does it take to get these out of development?
Because, you know, I been working on my little portfolio.
Y' all would still be chasing me.
You' re saying that your partner was a midget on a skateboard?
They took over this playground where I live.
They got this whole little midget underworld.
They squeezing us out because they selling everything half- price.
I' m innocent, yo.
Oh, innocent, huh?
Man, if you didn' t have a gun, I' d whup your ass.
A cocktail party?
- What do you got?
- We got nothing.
Both shot in the back of the head, execution- style.
Could be a 9 mil or a. 38.
I couldn' t find any empty shells.
They died about three hours ago, I would say.
All right, listen up.
My name is Edgar Clenteen.
I' m the chief investigator, Special Projects Unit, U. S. Treasury Dept.
And you all are contaminating it.
We got two young men here...... executed inside one of the most secure rooms on earth.
So whatever you find, I don' t care what it is, you bring it to me.
I will not have anyone fucking up this investigation.
Let Forensics do their work.
Get out.
I got one.
John Delano Jaster, a heavy- equipment operator with two prior felonies.
- Where the hell do I find him?
- He' s at Rikers.
- Who' s this?
- Well, who is this?
John Jaster, asshole.
Put my wife on the phone.
Your wife stepped out.
She told me to get the phone...... in case this was you and, you know, it was.
Who are you?
I' m just here fixing the heat.
Is there a number she can reach you at...... or a message or something?
She has been worried sick about you.
- You fix the heat, huh?
- Yeah, that' s right.
Let me tell you something.
Lady said you' d never go for it, but you' d save yourself a lot of grief...... you put in a new thermostat.
Tell my wife that I' m in Rikers.
Oh, you don' t say?
Just tell her to get her ass down here and get me out.
Don' t worry about it, pal.
I' il be sure to tell her.
Jerk- off.
Oh, that was your husband.
He wants you to get him out of jail.
But you' ve had a difficult day.
Why don' t I do it?
Good morning, sir.
I' d better not be wasting my time.
Wooly, what do you got?
Some guy they picked up on a petty theft heist for stealing shrimp.
- Shrimp.
That' s pure nerve gas.
You can use that shit for weapons and shit.
You burned the hairs out my nose.
They gotta protect the public.
I' m sorry.
I suppose you smell like daffodils.
You and your ass should get a divorce.
- I don' t feel good.
- Well, that makes two of us.
Did you eat some shit on a half shell?
Get it out.
See, that' s -- Yo, what' s up?
What' s up, man?
It' s my heart.
Yo, guard!
We need a doctor in here right now!
- What' s up?
Get the pills.
I' m coming, I' m coming.
You all right?
I' m gonna get somebody for you, all right?
You probably know me.
The shrimp heist, but it was actually prawns.
- If I don' t make it -- - Oh, come on with that.
This is important.
I need you to get a message to my wife.
Tell her...... that she should go to the Bronx Zoo.
The Bronx Zoo.
- Please.
Tell her, "There' s no place like home."
What about Toto...... and, you know, the yellow brick road?
What kind of pills you taking?
Are you through.
You get that message to her.
I' il make it worth your while.
Cool, cool.
You still break a brother off?
I need some change in my pocket.
Damn, he already shit all over --
Hands over your head and don' t move.
Drag this piece of crap upstairs.
What' s wrong with you?
Don' t treat him like an animal like that.
If it was me, I wouldn' t take that bullshit.
Are you a doctor?
We' re ready here, sir.
You been working out, huh?
Yeah, you better talk to him, boy.
You don' t know who you fooling --
I' il be right up here getting my sleep.
I' il whup your ass.
You don' t know who you just grabbed up on.
I' m a gangster.
Come here where there' s no light, I' il whup you.
You got your boys with your billy sticks.
They know me around these corridors.
How do you steal 40 million in gold and not have the cash to make bail?
I don' t know what you' re talking about.
Could you get me some?
Chewable.
How' d it happen?
How do you pull the heist of the decade...... and get busted for a DWl?
What kind of man...... goes out celebrating...... after he pops two boys in the back of the head?
Look, I didn' t....
You' re not hanging that on me.
They were on the floor...... facedown.
It was an execution, pure and simple.
No guns, man.
I' m no fucking shooter!
Then who?
Just give me the names.
It was just....
It was me and him.
Bullshit!
One guy!
I swear it.
Computer is what this guy' s got.
He' s got the whole government wired.
Who?
Come on, Jaster, tell me who.
Just give me a name.
Please, listen to me.
Get me a doctor.
- I' il give you a name.
- You' re giving me a brain tumor.
You give me a pass, I' il give you the fucking gold!
Nobody knows where it is but me, you know.
Did you burn your partner?
I need a doctor.
You took the gold and left him there, didn' t you?
You figured jail was the best place to lay low.
Just keep pulling my chain...... keep on with with this happy horseshit...... l' il make sure you do need a doctor.
- Ed?
- What, goddamn it?!
I don' t think he' s faking.
Damn, I was just trying to have a good meal.
Damn!
And I just thought you had gas.
- Get in there.
Sit down, Alvin.
Not there.
Got reserved seats.
Watching the game?
Big screen.
Hey, look, I apologize...... about that irreverent shit I displayed in the cell.
I was out of line.
I had been lifting weights...... and I just got through doing curls, so I was real tense.
I got some good news.
Want to hear the good news?
Yeah, I mean, good news is great.
You' re fucked.
Want to hear the bad news?
Unless you want to tell me worser news.
You' re alone in a room with me.
Yeah, right.
So, what you want?
All alone.
You must have talked about something.
His bowels.
He was shitting and coughing and it didn' t smell good.
How do you talk to somebody like that?
- It' s terrible.
I do this for a living.
You think I can' t see that you' re hiding something?
Okay, everybody out.
Alvin, think about Jaster...... and tell me where you want the bruises.
You trying to try some sneaky shit, huh?
You can do that, but you can' t beat on my soul.
Do the words "Stokely Carmichael" mean anything to y' all?
Reverend AI Sharpton?
I ain' t telling you shit nor the brothers behind the aquarium.
You can kiss my ass with your tongue...... and I will take this information to my grave.
The man said something about the Bronx Zoo, okay?
That would be your bats, your leopard cats, your mole rats.
We came up empty, sir.
- It' s gotta be a building.
Even the outhouse.
We scanned the entire grounds to a depth of 20 feet.
This guy was a heavy- equipment operator.
Five minutes with a machine, he could' ve buried the gold anywhere.
So where does that leave us, sir?
Square- fucking- one.
Come on, let' s go check the outhouse again.
Let' s go.
We have a national security crisis.
Citadel 4 is the same system we use to safeguard our nuclear facilities.
This guy took it apart like he was hot- wiring a Toyota.
I' il give you the short version.
We' re talking world- class loner.
A guy who spent literally tens of thousands of hours at a computer...... feeling around in the dark.
Nothing but numbers.
His sense of well- being, his very sanity is predicated on completion.
Only this time, the equation is incomplete.
He didn' t get the 42 million in gold he' d worked so very hard for.
That' s our edge.
Now this....
This is what I need your money for.
It' s an experimental tracking device.
Dr. Harris here can fill you in.
Well, it' s quite simple, really.
The BC- 19 has a proprietary signal...... broadcast and location.
It' s got a 10- mile radius and full satellite coordinate tracking.
Now, the optimum placement site...... is the temporal mandibular joint.
It' s just below the jaw.
All right, look...... we implant this in the appropriate subject, put him...... on the street, make it known he knows where the gold is...... and I guarantee that our elusive computer whiz will show up.
Who would be willing to have that thing implanted in their jaw?
Senator...... we already have a volunteer.
This is Howard Cosell.
Down goes Frazier!
- What you got?
- I got all kinds of shit.
Chest, chest, chest, nuts!
What do you know about boxing?
I get my skills from TV.
You biting me!
My ears, my ears!
I' il go Muhammad Ali on them.
That ain' t right.
I' il be set for life.
A 1 - year- old?
What sick shit is that?
I' m talking horses.
They got royalty in their blood.
- What you know about horses?
My father took me to the horse track.
I' m teaching you awareness here.
Stay aware of everything.
Watch my skills.
I' m always aware.
I' m on a swivel.
Can' t nobody sneak up on you and just get with you.
Mr. Clenteen, exactly how many laws are we breaking here?
You don' t want to know.
Ladies and gentlemen.
You' ve all distinguished yourselves.
You' re all the best at what you do.
Hardware.
Signal analysis.
And as of this moment...... nothing else in your lives exists.
You no longer exist.
Welcome aboard.
Don' t disappoint me.
Sir, I' m in.
All right, here we go.
Case number 141 1 263.
Subject:
Alvin Dean Sanders.
Former cellmate:
John Delano Jaster.
Released from Sing Sing prison Friday.
Treasury surveillance subcontract required.
Pay- grade status approved.
Split- shift overtime coverage.
Contact Special Agent Vicks at tspec. com.
Ed, you actually think this guy is surfing Treasury Department files?
We can make a less secure encryption.
Maybe we should indicate we think Sanders knows where the gold is.
I had a grandfather who was a trapper by profession.
Now he had two prices on his card: wolf...... and everything else.
Now a wolf...... will starve itself to death...... rather than make a mistake.
You have to lay down a scent that smells real from far away.
And the bait...... has to be fresh and untouched by human hands.
And make no mistake about it...... we are hunting wolf.
Send the message.
Voice recognition, please.
Voice recognition, please.
Bristol here.
- All is well and good.
Mainframe up, please.
Mainframe boot sequence complete.
System check, please.
All systems are online.
Let' s see....
Overnights, please.
Overnights loading from NSA...... and Treasury Department servers U. S. dot gov.
Overnights loaded, ready for review.
Where shall we start today?
NSA, please.
NSA loaded.
A secret, huh?
I love a secret.
Alvin...... do you feel like a lucky man?
Well, it depends on what you....
Of all the many crimes that men commit...... the worst punishment is rewarded those...... who squander their good fortune.
- You' re right, you' re right.
No, sir.
Well, you know, actually they were prawns.
You know the big jumbo shrimp that' s, like, at least a dollar --
Six weeks ago, in an internal investigation...... Miller admitted to a dozen counts of falsifying evidence.
Son of a...... Jesus.
Thank God for people that come forward.
Needless to say, we' ve been petitioned to repudiate the convictions.
What everybody needs more of is a little repudiation.
Use it in a sentence.
I have a short sentence for you, Alvin.
You walk.
I' m back, baby!
You miss me?
I' m free!
New York City, do you feel me?
Okay, let' s take it for a spin.
Satellite uplink is sealed.
Tracking is a go.
Hey, yo, taxi!
Yeah, where you going there?
I' m trying to get to Queens.
Jeez, that' s bad for me.
I don' t go to Queens.
What do you mean?
All right, guys, we' re up.
Checking sound levels.
Levels are stable, sir.
We have a visual?
Air Unit, this is Mobile 1.
Do you copy?
Roger that.
The bird has ears.
Who is it?
I' m here for your bills.
- Just like you people.
- Get your ass away from my door.
What' s up?
- What' s going down?
- What' s happening, baby?
- As a matter of fact....
Quit playing so much.
You know I got warrants and stuff around here.
- They let me go.
Well, that sound like some bullcrap.
I' m the man.
Oh, my God, Steven.
Oh, my God.
My stomach hurts and I' m crying.
What' s wrong?
Happy to be out?
You a full- fledged criminal.
That' s right.
We live here now.
Tell him, Stevie.
"Tell me, Stevie."
What is that?
That' s a Tika.
That' s a bullshit test.
You' re just fucking with me.
- I' m gonna do that.
Where' d you get all this?
Julio and Ramundo cut me in on a sweet Godfather deal.
See, you cut Julio and Ramundo out.
We back on the block.
This guy' s a real beauty.
Are you surprised?
I think I' il go...... see my girl, Lisa.
- Who?
- Lisa.
What you mean?
She ain' t been seeing nobody, has she?
It ain' t like I' m tripping on the whole thing.
I mean, not that I give a damn.
They' il do what they do and I' il do what I do.
You ain' t never been like --
I' m gonna shower and run over.
- Good seeing you.
- She probably -- - You went crazy since....
You my money.
Who' s Lisa?
That' s the girlfriend.
They were living together.
Lisa Hill, 27...... assistant manager ofBook Stew, a used bookstore in Soho.
I' m serious.
Put the boots on him.
Hang on.
You' re early.
You damn right I am.
Oh, my God.
Alvin?
You going on a date behind my back?
Fuck you, Alvin.
That' s music to my ears.
The couch?
You disappear for two years, then have the nerve to ask about my life?
Fuck you, Alvin.
Like "motherfuck you"?
Can' t be too jealous.
- Turn around and walk out.
Oh, thank you.
Now you can leave.
You need to pump your brakes and recognize that your man is home.
You escaped?
They released the dogs.
Harriet don' t move like she used to.
The dogs was chewing all on her ass.
You know what, I don' t have time for this random gibberish.
There was a dirty cop so they let me go.
Congratulations.
Now leave.
You don' t mean that.
How come you didn' t come see me?
I was going to come see you.
I was gonna write you and tell --
You wouldn' t understand.
I' m out.
Home?
No, see, this is my house.
I pay the bills, I pay the rent.
You pay...?
Excuse me.
You' re upset.
Stevie was the one behind the whole thing.
The next thing I know, I' m stealing.
I don' t remember hearing anything about Stevie going to jail.
I been around hard- core criminals.
I' d like to have a home- cooked meal, a hug from my woman.
What about a table dance?
- Oh, really?
And I' m ready for responsibility.
What is that?
What do you think it is?
A puppy, I hope.
It' s not a puppy.
What you been doing since I been gone?
What' s going on?
This is your son, Alvin.
That ain' t my son.
I don' t know.
I mean, how?
That night, after Stevie' s birthday party.
Yeah, we did and...... wow.
He don' t really look like me.
He kind of chubby, ain' t got no teeth.
IKind of cute.
Can I hold him?
Don' t be like that.
Can I hold my son?
He calling for his daddy anyway.
Look at this!
Me and you, and the next thing you know, we got this.
It' s like half and half, I guess, you know.
- He' il be a little player.
- He won' t be a player.
He' s strong.
Look at that grip.
Big old fella.
I think he sprung a leak.
He kind of smells.
Never mind, Alvin.
I' m going to work.
The babysitter will be here in five minutes.
Just give me another chance.
I' il take care of you.
We got a whole little family.
Don' t squeeze me out of that.
You know, Alvin, it' s been really hard.
I know.
It' s hard for everybody.
Okay, but you gotta prove yourself.
- Stay out of jail.
- I don' t remember how to get to jail.
And stop dressing like a thug.
I' il get a new Versace, Gucci.
- Having dinner with you.
You' il like the way I cook.
While I was in there, taught me how.
Bon giorno.
Or I can cook, like, soul food.
They done spoiled now. "
- Can I get a kiss?
- Goodbye, Alvin.
Take it easy.
- Lisa?
- Yes?
- His name is Gregory.
- Gregory.
Gregory.
That' s all right.
That' s your daddy.
I think old Alvin just might make it this time.
That' s all he is.
When he' s served his purpose...... when he draws our man out of the shadows....
Well, you know what happens to bait.
Well, well, well.
Decoding complete.
Sequence complete.
Clown.
Sushi chef.
Male exotic dancer.
That might be all right.
What' s cracking?
Yes, I' m looking for a Mr. Alvin Sanders.
I do not know if a Mr. Sanders is around.
Who is calling?
My name is Rhonda Glimsher.
I' m a student at Columbia University.
- Trace it.
- Master' s degree.
Toronto.
Dublin.
Madrid!
We' re on it.
Orlando?
I was given Mr. Sander' s name...... from the Department of Corrections.
Sons of bitches.
Anyway, go on.
Going through a call diverter!
- Give me 63 again.
Got the location.
Air unit, Mobile 1 requesting visual support.
I' m doing an aftercare survey as part of my thesis...... and I' m paying 200 dollars per interview.
200 dollars?
It' s a skipped signal.
Not isolating frequency.
- Try a back- end patch.
- What do you think I' m doing?
Are you Mr. Sanders?
I am not him, but I am Mr. Sanders'...... agent.
Give me 63 again.
Where are you?
Where is he?!
Mr. Sanders doesn' t like that.
Mr. Sanders could get upset...... and pop cap in ass.
- Showing 13 countries!
- It was 74!
Stay on the line.
IKeep him on the line.
- It must be another call box.
I' il call back in a few days for an appointment.
Make sure you do because I really need to get that cash.
Thank you for your time.
We got nothing here!
He' s gone.
I' ve never seen anything like this.
It was him.
He crawled out from the dark...... and he fucking bit.
What' s happening, my man?
- May I help you?
- Yeah, I' m looking for a job.
Wait tables or whatever.
But everything is cool now.
Didn' t you rob me a few years ago?
You walked in with a skinny guy...... picked up my cash register and ran out the door with it.
No, that wasn' t me.
I don' t hang out with thin dudes.
Number four.
Cute.
Now you' re here asking me for a job?
I' m calling the police.
I need the cops.
- You tripping.
Everybody...... you see, this is a resume.
This isn' t happening.
Please, I' m putting the resume down right now.
IKeep eating, please.
Ricky Martin, don' t make me do this.
I ain' t here for this.
WWF!
I called the cops.
Getting a job is getting dangerous.
Stop that guy!
- Oh, fuck.
Or not.
Give me another chance.
I' il get out there.
Take care ofmyself, I' il take care of you.
We got a whole little family.
Don' t squeeze me out of that.
What' s my son' s name?
Gregory.
Alvin, get in.
Stevie...... is this stolen?
I' m tight with them.
No, you ain' t.
I ain' t getting in.
Julio and Ramundo...... hooked me up with this.
Alvin, get in.
It' s stolen.
It is not stolen.
Man, it is cold outside.
Get in.
I' il go through some cold.
I ain' t standing here much longer.
Why you got to be my brother?
I know you' il get me in trouble.
I' m gonna rock this box in your ear.
We' re on the 59th Street Bridge, headed into the city.
This ain' t the way home.
We got some business to take care of.
Steven, I told you, man --
Just sit back and relax.
I' m something like a pimp.
I' m supposed to be a pimp on the thirteenth.
I' m something like it.
Moving east on Canal.
He' s going to the docks.
According to this file on Steve, that' s where he makes his pickups.
They got an undercover special going down tonight at Pier 27.
Christ!
That stupid son of a bitch is about to get pinched.
Mobile 3, move in.
Pull over.
I' m not doing this.
Pull the car over.
Alvin, you' re ex- con.
You got 26 dollars in your pocket, 25 of it is mine.
- Pull over.
- I' m not pulling --
- Get your finger out my face.
- Get your finger out my face.
- Don' t touch me.
- Don' t touch me.
- Don' t touch me.
- Don' t touch me.
- I ain' t.
- You touched me.
- I didn' t touch you!
- Hello?
- Give me this phone.
- Yo, Stevie.
Ramundo?
He can' t come to the phone.
- Give me the phone.
- "Ah, it' s so good!"
"It' s not fair that you do your thing!"
It was that fuck, Alvin.
That kid ain' t nothing but trouble.
Stop playing, man!
I make 10 G' s off them a week.
- Ten G' s?
I bought 160 for...... it was 84, something like that.
- That' s right.
Turn left on East Broadway...... half a mile before they turn.
- Do not let him make that turn.
- Copy that.
What' s going on?
Did you jump out a cab and not pay?
Quit talking and drive.
You can' t run into me!
Do I know you?
- This dude' s losing his mind.
Right now!
- To shoot you.
- Don' t you have a gun?
Pull the fucking car over!
Get away!
- I know.
Trip around him!
Handle your business, boy!
Watch out!
What the hell was that?
Shit, man.
We late.
We can walk to the docks from here.
You with me?
Come on.
You with me?
Can' t be a fuck- up all your life.
- He' s moving.
- Direction?
North on Jackson Street.
Away from the docks.
You undercover piece of shit.
Does your mother know what you do for a living?
That' s real funny.
Watch your head.
I think I know why Stevie didn' t show.
I think he set us up.
Him and his brother, Alvin.
All right, I want every agent working around the clock...... to keep this joker out of the morgue and out of jail.
He doesn' t get so much as a parking ticket or a hangnail.
From now on, Alvin Sanders leads a charmed life.
Come on, come on.
Alvin, it' s late.
I know, but I really need to talk to you right now.
I got this for Gregory.
- An egg?
- It' s supposed to be magic.
Anyway, he can' t swallow it.
Can I come in?
Just for a minute?
- The baby' s sleeping.
- All right.
Did I ever tell you that I had a very happy childhood?
- Stevie.
Dad used to pick me up every day to take the cargo train to Manhattan.
I knew it really well.
I know.
Your dad trained horses.
Not really.
No.
No, he was a....
I lied about that.
With the thoroughbreds, he was magic.
But, you know, job didn' t pay shit.
So, therefore, our Christmases, we didn' t get jack shit.
Which really pissed him off.
Robbed them.
I was like, "Damn, Santa Claus got the wrong address or what?"
So I' m bouncing from toy to toy like I' m some kind of drunk dude.
My father' s smiling.
It' s all good, right?
Then around 8: 30, cops show up.
Take the toys, take my father.
But for about two and a half hours...... l had a very, very happy childhood.
Why are you telling me all this?
Because I love you.
Talk about a bunch of crap.
It' s all true.
He knows so much, why not get a job at the track?
Can' t work there with a record.
He' s just trying to get laid.
It' s so soft.
- What' s that smell?
- It' s mango.
Oh, mango!
Oh, shit.
Who is he?
All right, I' m gonna go to Starbucks and get a Mango Grande.
- Mocha.
- Mocha Cappuccino.
Who is it?
Registered letter for Alvin Sanders.
- Who' s it from?
- Uncle Sam.
I just got out, man.
I know my rights.
It says in the Constitution on page 53, "We the People...... in order to keep shit straight --" Quit messing with me.
I think it' s a check.
Good afternoon.
Where l -- Let me see where I sign.
I don' t ever get no checks.
No pun intended.
You make the news --
Apologies from the federal government, $5000?
Guess it' s your lucky day.
Hey, man, tell Uncle Sam he cool with me, man.
Apology accepted.
Tell him he can come through anytime he want to.
I' m up in there!
- I' m up in there!
You think maybe we gave him too much?
Let' s just hope this keeps him out of trouble for a couple weeks.
Butt- naked in the Forest, But Does Anybody Hear Me?
What?
I' m here to see you.
Listen, I got great news.
You found a job!
But I got something better than that.
You said things would be different this time.
Things are very different.
Look at this.
I got a check from the government for $5000.
The government gave you $5000.
All right, tell me anything.
The government gave me a check.
I signed it over to you.
What the fuck is he doing?
Actually, it' s taxpayer money.
It' il pay for some of the things...... like the back rent.
Some of the money I borrowed --
Like the stereo you sold.
- I sold the stereo?
- Or the VCR you took.
- I took the VCR?
The blender was cheap.
I didn' t get that much money for the blender.
I' m not taking it, Alvin.
I don' t think you understand.
It' s hard right now.
I think you need it more than I do.
Get him platinum baby pieces or something like that, you know.
He' il probably be a little rapper.
- No, maybe he' s gonna be a doctor.
- Why would he want to do that?
Doctor' s great.
I was thinking -- You thinking like I' m thinking.
Say it' s from his father.
Alvin, honestly, have you really been trying to find a job?
I have been out there.
You sound like my mom.
Go get you a nice dress.
Look at your brown eyes.
Get back to work before we both be out of work.
Okay, step.
Thank you.
Sorry, my man.
Don' t mention it.
Simple.
We give him more money.
You sure that' s necessary?
He 'il never change.
We just gotta keep him clean for a few more days.
- Well, how much money?
- Sixty- five hundred.
Wouldn' t it be cheaper to send him to NYU?
How do you feel about working in Alaska?
I' il get right on this.
You gotta help me, man!
You gotta help me!
Get your damn hands off me.
Slow down coming through here, now.
What' s going on?
Hey, you dropped your bag!
Hey, man, you dropped your bag.
You dropped your bag.
Man, you done dropped your bag.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
I' il take it to lost and found.
Found where you lost it.
Man, where you guys been?
Man, I was just thinking about you.
Are you stupid?
This is my fucking car.
This is my baby.
Oh, sorry.
Your brother fucked us!
Cool.
- What headache?
- Does it hurt?
I' m passing whuppings out.
You got the gun.
Stevie' s fucking my girl, right?
That' s a point to take up with Stevie.
Maybe Stevie don' t want to be around for us to make a point with him.
What are you talking about?
Stevie skipped out.
Don' t get so fucking complex.
You' re complex.
Do I need to be here for this shit?
Shut up!
Stay put.
They' re not gonna kill him.
They' re just having fun.
They' il beat him to a pulp.
I think that' s a reasonable assumption.
I hope you like soup...... because I' m about to knock every one of your teeth...
-... down your throat.
Can you tell me how to get to the Fashion Museum?
I' m a little lost.
Put the gun down.
Go get lost somewhere else.
Ain' t you shocked at how it went down?
You came at the right time.
We don' t have much time, Alvin.
What you talking about?
There' s a question you need to answer.
- Shit!
Unit 2, approach from the south.
You need to answer my question.
How you know my name?
I' il see you soon, Alvin.
There he is!
Damn!
What' s going on?
He 's in the coffee shop.
Get out of the way.
Get some guys at both ends of the alley.
You' re alone in a room with me.
I think it' s a check.
Guess it' s your lucky day.
We' re ready here, sir.
I thought I' d find you here.
I did too.
You want a drink or something?
No, I need to talk to you.
- Right now?
- Let' s go, right now.
I' m coming.
Fucking ass.
What y' all doing in the men' s bathroom?
Alvin, man, what' s happening?
By yourself?
Not now.
Everything in here' s broke.
Have you ever heard of a man getting $5000 dropped in his lap?
Never.
What about twice in one day?
You got ten G' s?
- Let me see.
- Calm down.
I need you to keep this for me, okay?
I gotta get out of town because there' s some strange shit going on.
Read the note.
Stevie, read the note.
Are you listening to me?
Oh, yeah.
I just wanted to let you know I' m looking up to you.
Look up to me another time, all right?
I need you to do the right thing.
Be careful, Alvin.
Shit!
I want both mobile units to maintain visual contact.
If he leaves town...... l want to know where he' s going before he does.
What if our killer can' t find him?
We' il just have to make sure he can.
Oh, my nuts.
My balls.
Okay, tickets.
Alveen!
- Shut up.
- Get your ass in here!
My name is Alvin, not "Alveen."
That is personal.
I don' t even know it, and if I did...... nobody wants to talk you.
There' s a message in your name.
Nobody is that smart.
"Hello, Alvin, it seems we have some unfinished business.
Unfortunately, your phones are being tapped...... and you' re being followed. "
Tika, not now, not now.
"You have a beautiful son.
It would be a shame if you didn' t follow these instructions.
Leave the apartment at exactly 4 p. m...... and go to the following address. "
Get on the first subway car you see. "
Here we go.
I want to make this clear at the top:
Take him out, no matter what.
If the only way to get to him is through Alvin...... so be it.
You shoot...... l' il answer the letters.
Just give me 60 minutes, people, without any fuckups...... you can have a nice vacation.
One more block and he gets a cab.
Be alert.
Got you.
He' il be there in three minutes.
No problem.
Well, I' m not certain that' s entirely accurate, Agent Wooly.
Arms at your side.
Let' s take a little walk, shall we?
Alvin' s passed Wooly, but there' s no confirmation.
His radio' s out, sir.
What do you mean, his radio' s out?
- There' s no response.
- Well, what about Sanders?
- He' s proceeding exactly as told.
The subway?
Train' s just arriving.
I' m headed out.
IKeep your eyes open, everybody.
He' s at the phone booth.
We 're in position.
I' m at the red bench.
They' re all red benches.
This is it.
Let' s go!
Out of the way!
Watch his hands.
Game' s over.
I' m just sitting on the bench.
Cordon off the area.
What are you doing here?
I thought I' d come and get me some.
Maybe I didn' t make myself clear.
My brother gave me money and a note...... to e- mail him some fucked- up James Bond shit and meet him here.
Ain' t no crime in that.
- Damn, you getting smarter.
You think this is a game?
You have no idea what you' re dealing with.
He ain' t too stupid.
He got your ass down here.
This is just, you know, fried hummus.
- Piece of shit!
Get your hands off me.
I' m just trying to get a ride.
I' il give you a ride.
You promised we' d go to the track.
She' s not running till the 7th race.
Get in the fucking car.
You owe me a falafel, motherfucker.
This the wrong time for this.
I need to go to the crib right now.
You won' t be seeing home for a long time.
How many times I gotta say I don' t know where Stevie is?
This is about you.
This is about you and your friend who buzzed me with that thing.
He' s after me.
- What the fuck?
- How' d I do what?
That came out of the radio.
- A what?
- You know, the guy does the shit -- - Like a DJ?
You know, with the voices and the dummies and shit.
Yeah, yeah.
I' m a ventriloquist.
We' re traveling in a black Mercedes...... with two Bert- and- Ernie - Iooking motherfuckers inside...... on Madison Ave.
You suck.
I could see your lips moving.
I' m gonna need backup.
One Adam - 12.
Code three.
I need backup.
Emergency, I need backup.
Shut him the fuck up!
We got a problem.
What are you doing?
Don' t point that gun at me!
Don' t point that gun at me!
- You shot me, bitch.
- Look out for the bus!
God, give me strength!
- Shoot the bag!
- All right, look out.
God, I can' t breathe.
Open the door!
Alvin, get back here.
Help us out!
I hate this guy.
Alvin Sanders is the devil.
Open the window.
Help us out of here!
We are negative on all signals.
Scanning visual matrix.
Negative.
- We could try to isolate a pitch.
- It' s a million- to- one shot.
I would like to make a deal with the United States Treasury Department.
Sir?
- Can we trace it?
I' d like to trade the life ofa Treasury agent...... for the 42 million in gold.
Transferring signal.
If you want Mr. Wooly alive, turn over Mr. Sanders to me.
Midtown Winslett, 36th Street.
Lisa, what' s wrong with you?
Girl, what' s wrong with you?
Alvin, get up, baby.
Please get up.
Come on, Alvin.
Come on, come on, please get up.
Alvin, please get up.
Why are you doing this to us?
Give us a break.
Did you have a nice sleep?
What' d you do with Lisa?
I put her in the other room with Gregory.
They' re fine.
We don' t play these type of games here.
You see, Alvin, I just want what' s mine.
I was used by the government, and now they' re using you.
I have nothing to do with the government.
Oh, yes, you do.
Here I am.
Now for your sake...... let' s hope you can help me find my gold.
Gold?
Give me a pen.
I would like to make a deal with the United States Treasury Department.
That son of a bitch.
I' d like to trade the life ofa Treasury agent --
He knew Alvin was being surveilled.
This whole thing was just a diversion.
All right, the drill is simple.
We find Alvin before he does.
The math on this is extremely problematic.
I need it.
You don' t provide that information, I have to kill you.
What are my options?
Obviously...... there' s torture.
No, come on.
That' s... uh- uh.
That' s a point well taken, Alvin.
- Yeah.
So unpredictable.
No, wait.
See...... did that really hurt?
And if so, how much?
But I will tell you this:
I do not have the time...... l do not have the manpower, and I do not have the assets for error.
Do you understand that?
Do you get that?
I am tired of fucking around with you, Alvin!
When you get your money, you need to get an anger management class.
No, you' re not very smart, are you?
Shut up!
Shut up!
You like little kids, right?
That' s my boy in there.
It don' t matter what' s going on between us.
I' il do anything.
It' s between us.
Let' s go get that gold, man.
I' m sorry for that primitive outburst.
I' ve decided the best course of action...... is to contrast the fear of certain death with an indulgent incentive.
Force you to choose between the extremes.
I' m prepared to offer you the same deal I had with Jaster.
We find the gold, you get to keep six bricks to do with as you please.
Roughly one million dollars.
And, Alvin...... it' s a one- time, non- negotiable offer.
All right, let me get this straight:
The offer is a million dollars...... or you kill me.
Correct.
If that' s all you got...... we' il work with that.
Clear.
What is that?
It' s coffee, sir.
I wonder why he didn' t kill him.
Alvin must' ve talked.
He doesn' t know anything.
I just said he talked.
Take more men.
All right, let' s go.
She gonna be all right, right?
She will be, if you do what you' re supposed to do.
You' re gonna have to trust me.
I could trust you a lot better if you would let my girl and kid go.
No, no, no.
Lisa and your little boy are motivational tools.
Air Unit, what do you got?
We got nothing.
- Do a sweep on channel 34.
- Affirmative.
- Negative.
- Negative.
- No signal.
Alvin Sanders is a needle in a haystack.
Can I help you?
All right, Detective Wooly, go ahead.
What are you doing?
I told you it' s in the back stables, not here.
I understand.
Do you think he hid the shit in a concession stand?
This is perfect.
Glad you like it.
Hey...... hey, little man.
Daddy got to run out and take care of some business.
I' il be right back.
You take care of your mother, okay?
I' m waiting, Alvin.
Yeah, I' m coming.
All right, little player.
What the hell is that?
While I have no doubt about your sincerity, if there is no gold...... l' m sure you' d agree, there should be some penalty.
We don' t need these anymore...... considering there' s no way my little toy can be disarmed without me.
All right, Alvin.
Lead the way.
I told you the shit wasn' t over here.
What if we don' t get back in time?
We gonna end up killing 5000 people.
Perhaps we shouldn' t be standing around chatting, then.
Anything happen to my kid or girl, it' s gonna be bad for you.
How much gold is there?
Roughly 42 million dollars.
You the lncredible Hulk?
How you getting all this gold out of here?
Yeah.
All right, here we are.
Nine.
No, no, no, no.
No, it' s not very logical.
Logical or not...... it' s buried in the back.
I gotta get to my family.
- I ain' t gotta do shit for you -- - All right, open it.
You can open it yourself.
Open it!
It' s all right.
It' s all right, big fella.
Calm down, now.
Just calm down.
What the hell is that?
You soft.
We got him.
He' s at the Manhattan Race Track.
Get some of this, huh?
Alvin!
Come on, Frigid Pleasure, you motherfucker!
That' s my horse!
- There' s another horse on the field.
- Slow down, slow down!
I can' t control this shit!
You gotta stop!
Look out!
I can' t control her!
You can slow down now.
Do you see the people?
Don' t you see the people?
Couldn' t be.
It' s him.
It' s the devil.
Get out of the way!
Move!
Move!
He' s jumped.
Lisa!
Lisa, Lisa.
Wake up, baby.
- I' m getting him out.
- What are you doing with Gregory?
Hold on.
I' il be right back to get you.
Lisa, you got to wake up.
Ain' t nothing wrong with the baby.
We got a situation.
What is that?
- That' s a bomb, baby.
- It' s a kaboom bomb, not a kapow bomb.
- That' s a really big bomb.
Pull it!
Pull it!
Come on, Alvin.
Where' s the baby?
Where' s my baby, Alvin?
What' s that?
Turn your head.
Come on.
What' s going on?
Just take the baby and run.
Let' s go get the baby now!
I gotta take care of this!
- Alvin, no!
Fuck that.
Some shit I do know how to do right here.
Get out of the way!
I got a bomb.
You got to move!
Move out of the way!
No!
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit!
Brakes!
Man, you almost shot me!
Shit!
You could' ve fucked around and shot me.
But I didn' t.
Well, I guess I owe you one.
- Yeah.
- Oh, man, this trick shoulder.
I can' t really control my shit.
It' s okay.
Get that piece of shit out of here.
Y' all did bust me upside the head with a brick.
We did a lot more than that.
No.
Whether you know or not, you did a good thing for your country.
We need to talk about what the country' s gonna do for me.
I ain' t having a good day.
You got some aspirin on you?
You want chewable?
You be rolling with the shit in your pocket?
- You don' t smoke, do you?
You got some water?
Hey, you two.
Oh, man....
- Yeah, we had a good time.
Let' s make another one.
We had a question to ask you.
What might that be?
He' s a genius like me.
We' re thinking of moving up...... to peanut butter, but I don' t want his mouth to get stuck all together.
Baby, he already eats peanut butter.
You done bamboozled me.
Excuse me, I' m sorry.
I' m looking for The Bronx Zoo by Sparky Lyle.
Did you try upstairs in the nature section?
It' s about baseball.
They call it the Bronx Zoo.
Check in the back on the left side, in sports.
Bronx Zoo?
"There' s no place...... like home."
I need to make a phone call...... to my accountant.
Clenteen.
You never write.
Alvin, how you doing?
About to do a lot better.
Let me ask you: what' s your policy on finder' s fees?
That depends on what you find.
How about $40 million in gold?
- You know where the gold is?
- I might.
Don' t mess with me, Alvin.
It' s in the back ofmy head.
What' s it gonna take to get it to the front?
- You tell me.
Five percent?
Five percent is bullshit!
Two million dollars is bullshit?
Oh, that' s five percent, is two million?
I carried it, just not far enough.
What I' m saying is, two million dollars could work.
Med school for Gregory ain 't cheap.
Where' s the gold, Alvin?
Do you like baseball?
You know the problem with Hollywood?
They make shit.
Unbelievable, unremarkable shit.
I' m not some wannabe filmmaker...... searching for existentialism through a haze of bong smoke.
No, it' s easy to pick apart bad acting, shortsighted directing...... and a moronic stringing together of words the studios term as prose.
No, I' m talking about the lack of realism.
Realism.
Not a pervasive element in modern American cinematic vision.
Take Dog Day Afternoon, for example.
Arguably Pacino' s best work.
Short of Scarface and Godfather Part I, of course.
Masterpiece of directing, easily Lumet' s best.
The cinematography, the acting, the screenplay, all topnotch.
But...
... they didn' t push the envelope.
What if, in Dog Day Sonny wanted to get away with it?
Really wanted that.
Now this is the tricky part.
What if he started killing hostages right away?
No mercy, no quarter.
"Meet our demands or the pretty blond gets it in the head." Bam, splat.
Come on.
How many innocent victims would it take for the city...... to reverse its policy on hostages?
There' s no CNN.
There' s no CNBC.
There' s no Internet.
Fast- forward to today.
Present time, same situation.
How quickly would the media make a frenzy?
In hours.
It would be the biggest story from Boston to Budapest.
Ten hostages die.
Twenty, thirty.
Relentless.
Bam, bim.
One after another.
All on hi- def, computer- enhanced.
You can almost taste the brain matter.
A bus, a plane?
A couple million dollars that' s federally insured?
I don' t think so, but...... just a thought.
I mean, it' s not...... within the realm of conventional cinema, but...
... what if?
- There' s a problem with that movie.
- Really?
- It wouldn' t work.
- How come?
- Audiences love happy endings.
- Pacino escapes with the money.
Boyfriend gets a sex change.
Live happily ever after.
- No?
- No.
Homophobia.
Bad guy can' t win.
It' s a morality tale.
One way or the other, he' s gotta go down.
Well, life is stranger than fiction sometimes.
You know, guys, I gotta go.
Gotta jet.
Thanks for the coffee.
Stan.
Time to go to work.
You coming?
Move.
I won' t say it again.
I have a clear shot.
Shooters, stand by.
Okay.
Now what?
Don' t worry, folks, it' s almost over.
Is she done?
- She' s done.
- Move her out.
Don' t worry, you' il be fine.
You' il be back before you know it.
Turn the fuck around.
Rescue team, let' s go.
Who' s on the roof?
All shooters, you are holding for command.
You' re doing good.
Behave yourself.
Look over there, and there.
All prepare their shot.
- What are you doing?
- I' m handling this!
Don' t fuck with this guy!
You' il get these people killed!
We got two teams on the roof.
We got a team over there.
Double this team up.
That' s your best angle.
Don' t talk.
Just listen.
Each of the 22 hostages is wrapped with 20 pounds of C- 4 explosives.
They' re also taped with 15 pounds of stainless steel ball bearings.
Which makes them the world' s largest claymore mines.
They got the green light.
I got this guy on the phone!
I' m done playing with this asshole!
Around their necks are radio- frequency electronic dog collars.
Dog walks out of the yard, gets the shit shocked out of him.
Same here.
This bank is their yard, so don' t fuck with me.
Johnson, you and your partner move up between those vehicles.
- Stand down!
- Get back!
- Get back!
- Officer, stand down now!
He' s gonna shoot!
He' s gonna shoot!
Shit.
Get her!
Go!
No!
Release the hostage!
No!
Release the hostage!
She' s gone.
Take cover!
No, no!
Let her go!
Let her go!
Release the hostage!
Help me!
Let her go.
Let her go!
- Shit!
You guys, come on!
- How long will you be here?
- One week.
- Business or pleasure?
- Hopefully both.
- What type of work do you do?
- I' m a consultant.
Excuse me.
Could you be careful with that?
That' s expensive equipment.
- How long will this take?
- A few minutes.
Sit down, relax.
I' il be right back.
A few minutes, huh?
Hey, where' s he going?
It' s going up.
Stairs.
Sir, could you please --?
Easy, easy.
This better be important.
Wouldn' t have asked you otherwise, senator.
We just received word that Axl Torvalds was intercepted entering the U. S.
- When was this?
- Within the last two hours.
According to my FBI source, he was nabbed in customs at LAX.
- They know he' s working for us?
- It' s unlikely.
It was a routine check.
Torvalds freaked out.
They got lucky.
This ain' t good.
What do the feds know?
Nothing yet.
He' s refusing to speak English.
The Finnish consulate has contacted the State Department.
- So we haven' t been compromised?
- I' m not sure.
I' m working on that.
You better get sure because someone' s cock will end up on the block...... and it won' t be mine.
I understand, senator.
There you go.
Who are you supposed to be?
- I' m Ginger.
- Ginger, huh?
Where' s Gilligan?
For someone the NSA once listed as the most dangerous hacker in America...... you sure don' t look like much.
Surprised?
I know everything about you, Stan.
What are you selling again?
My employer wants to meet you.
- Shit.
- You' re not too good at golf.
You' re fucking up my chi.
Let me have that.
This is not a nice place you got here, Stan.
Here 5 minutes, and I already feel sorry for myself.
You' re wasting your time.
I touch a computer, I go back to Leavenworth.
Do not pass Go, do not collect $200.
If I knew you were coming, I might have cleaned up.
I' m not here to suck your dick, Stanley.
He' il pay you just to meet you.
I gotta go to work.
Right.
Great work greasing pump jacks.
So...... spoke to Holly lately?
Shit!
Hello?
Melissa.
Is Holly home?
Why are you calling here?
- I just want to talk with Holly.
- It' s Saturday.
She' s at soccer.
It' s illegal for you to talk to her.
Don' t do this, Mel.
It' s not good for Holly.
How would you know what' s good for my daughter?
You spent the last two years in prison.
- Mel.
- Stop calling me that, Stanley.
Look, I just....
I just want to see my baby.
Well, she doesn' t want to see you, Stanley.
And I swear, if you try to contact her...... I' il have you thrown in a hole so dark...... Leavenworth will seem like two weeks in Vegas...... during which I will personally...... pay two skinheads to make a playground out of your ass.
You can take the girl out of the trailer park...... but can' t take the trailer park out of the girl.
I will not let myself be manipulated by you, Stanley.
Larry' s her father now.
Larry' s the porn king of Southern Calif --
Larry is a film financier.
The films he chooses are for profit and none of your business.
Get help.
Get into a program, get a therapist, get a dog.
But whatever you do, stay away from my child.
- Your child?
She' s our child.
- She will never be your child.
Forget Holly.
What are you still doing here?
Look, I' m beginning to lose my sense of humor.
Then I' il cut to the chase.
If you want your daughter back, you better listen up.
Unless you want to stay here in this loser existence...... while your daughter grows up to be a fluffer in her new daddy' s videos.
Please don' t confuse your own childhood with my daughter' s.
And look at your situation, Stanley.
For the past 20 months, you' ve been in and out of court 6 times?
Each time your case was thrown out.
Situation doesn' t look good, sweetheart.
How much money would it cost to hire the best family lawyer in the country?
A lot.
Come here.
Come here.
Judas.
That should get you started.
Hundred grand.
What do you got to lose?
He just wants to meet you.
One time.
You don' t like the situation...... walk away.
- And that' s it?
- That' s it.
And you keep the money.
What did he say?
All right, look, look.
Your client is wanted on 24 counts of electronic crimes...... in 6 different countries.
He has a Finnish passport.
These allegations are not recognized as crimes.
Your laws don' t apply.
Do you see a Finnish flag hanging on the wall, IKEA boy?
- What did he say?
- He said IKEA is Swedish.
He understands English, huh?
- Let me talk to him.
- He' s all yours.
You' re fucked up now, Hamlet.
The thing is, they have you put the furniture together yourself.
My client has reserved his right not to answer any questions.
Why would the best hacker in the world...... risk life imprisonment by coming into the continental U. S.?
Okay, what did he just say?
He never misses an episode of Survivor.
Did he really say that?
You' re funny.
- How much do you weigh?
- How much do I weigh?
We' il call you if we need you.
Eat a dick.
Wipe that smile off your face.
A year ago, I was head of the largest cyber- criminal task force in the world.
But I burned out.
I snapped.
I shot a suspect in the hand.
You know how difficult it is to work a keyboard with one hand?
You don' t understand.
Whatever you want to do to me, he' il do worse.
I' m already dead.
My only chance is back in Europe.
I have friends there.
Tell me what I want to know.
First class.
Courtesy of the U. S. government.
Who is he?
- I don' t know his name.
You don' t know?
Tell me something.
I' il tell you what I know.
He exists in a world beyond your world.
What we only fantasize, he does.
He lives a life where nothing is beyond him.
But you know what?
It' s all a facade.
For all his charm and charisma, his wealth, his expensive toys...... he is a driven, unflinching, calculating machine.
He takes what he wants, when he wants...... and disappears.
So how do I find him?
You don' t find him.
He finds you.
Here' s how it works.
His people pick me up.
Take me to him.
He tells me what he wants me to do.
I do the job right there.
I get paid, and I leave.
That' s a really nice story, but you haven' t told me shit, have you?
You have a call.
- Take a message.
It' s assistant director Joy.
He said it' s important.
I can only tell you what I' ve done for him.
Well, that' s a start.
Thank you.
You' ve just let my client go free.
- You denied his right to counsel -- - Excuse me.
Yeah, and you eat the dick!
Yes, I got a call from A. D. Joy.
This is Roberts.
Hold for just one moment, sir.
- Joy.
- Yeah, Roberts.
You needed me.
You didn' t call?
No, Roberts.
What do you want?
You should' ve let me buy you a suit, Stanley.
I' m happy with what I' m wearing.
Ignorance is bliss.
Miss me?
- Stanley, Gabriel.
- Big Stan.
- Nice suit.
- Thanks.
- They say the clothes make the man.
- You buy it?
Hope not.
Drink?
I flew 1500 miles for this meeting.
How about we get to the point?
No.
Actually, you flew 1500 miles for 100 grand.
But that' s not the point.
Helga.
Meet Stanley.
- Hello, Stanley.
- Helga.
Look, I don' t have a lot of patience, Gabriel.
Maybe you can help me with something.
Take a look at this.
You know I can' t touch that.
Do you like tequila, Stanley?
This is bullshit.
You want something from me, and I from you.
DOD d- base, 128- bit encryption.
What do you think?
- Impossible?
- Nothing' s impossible.
Good.
Maybe slide in a Trojan horse hiding a worm?
- Is this an interview?
- Sort of.
Marco.
Give him some incentive.
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Relax, Stanley.
I have been told that the best crackers in the world...... can do this in 60 minutes.
Unfortunately, I need someone to do it in 60 seconds.
You' re kidding.
Afraid not.
Go.
Get up, get up!
- Fifty- five.
- Get on with it.
- What the hell is this?
- Time' s a- wasting, big guy.
Oh, Jesus.
Forty- five seconds.
Oh, she' s good, isn' t she?
What' s going on here?
Jesus Christ.
- More time, more time!
- Come on, Stan!
Nineteen.
Fifteen.
Come on.
Ten.
Nine.
Three.
Two.
One.
- Too bad.
You gotta die.
- No, wait!
I was just fucking with you, Stan.
That' s our guy.
- Get away from me.
- I really want to help you, Stan.
Like you helped me in there?
- That was a test, Stan.
- A test.
And you passed.
I don' t know why I let you talk me into this.
You' re saving your daughter.
I' d do anything for her, but if I end up in a box or in jail...... then I really can' t help her.
I' m taking my money and going back to court!
With your little $100, 000?
Melissa will throw $500, 000 back at you.
Think!
I' m thinking that you' il put a gun to my head just to see if I can --
I can' t pee in front of an audience.
Let me break it down to you, Stanley, one last time.
You live in a trailer.
You' re a felon.
You work a dead- end job.
And you desperately want your daughter back.
Gabriel is your only shot.
Take it.
- I' m concerned about our new friend.
- Oh, now, don' t be jealous.
I don' t see him dragging his sorry ass over the finish line.
- Thought we lost you.
- Tell me what the deal is.
The deal is that we' re having a little gathering at the house.
Come and I' il explain it to you there.
Gentlemen, if it' s not good news, don' t say it.
Actually, we have a ray of hope in the darkness of your life.
When we grabbed Torvalds at the airport, these two guys were there.
Check this out.
Recognize those two same guys, a few hours later.
And then...
... guess who shows up.
Stanley Jobson.
Wired magazine' s 1996 Man of the Year.
A burnout now, but the hacker Zeitgeist then.
Yeah, I know Jobson, I arrested him.
Why are you in L. A., Stan?
His ex- wife and daughter live in Malibu.
The new husband owns Backdoor Films, a shady porn production house.
The production value' s good, considering that they shoot on video.
- His wife is in some of the videos.
She' s like an actress.
That' s great.
Are you done?
Who' s the girl?
Actually, sir, we don' t know yet.
- She' s a serious piece of talent.
- Man, she' s way out of his league.
Find out who she is.
- Sit on the ex- wife' s house.
- You got it.
Stanley, you want to get wet?
- I don' t have a suit.
- You don' t need one.
- Come on, Stan.
- Later.
- Some view.
Let' s get a drink.
- Pool lights on.
- So how did you do it?
- Do what?
Break the code.
I dropped a logic bomb through the trap door.
You didn' t have time.
- What' il you have?
- Scotch.
- You can do better than that.
- I used a password sniffer.
How did you do it?
I see the code in my head.
I can' t explain it.
Let me show you something.
Pretty impressive, huh?
So, what we need from you is a worm.
A hydra, actually.
A multiheaded worm to sniff out digital footprints across an encrypted network.
- What kind of cipher?
- A Vernam encryption.
The key code is destroyed upon implementation.
And it' s a true 128- bit encryption.
Well, actually, we' re talking a 512- bit.
- That' s definitely not possible.
- What if I give you 10 million dollars?
That would cover all your problems.
Yes?
Unless, of course, it' s not possible.
But you think about it.
It won' t bite you.
I promise.
This is not just a multi- screen system.
It has a DS- 3 connection.
We can access 6 different networks simultaneously.
It has a central encryption you have to crack to utilize the system.
Try it.
It' il be hard without a gun to my head.
Maybe I should put a gun to your head.
I thought you were Gabriel' s.
- Ginger.
You surprised that a girl with an IQ over 60 can give you a hard- on?
So is it impossible?
Nothing' s impossible.
So we have a deal.
- Morning.
- You mean afternoon?
Can I borrow your car for something?
Sure.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
Hey, Stan, if you' re going to see Holly...... I suggest you re- evaluate the way you look.
Just a thought.
Come on, Mom, pick up.
- Mom late again?
- She' il be here in a minute.
Hi.
Can I have the phone number for Yellow Cab?
Need a lift?
Daddy!
Oh, what are you doing here?
- I missed you so much.
- Oh, I missed you too, baby.
It' s so cute.
Oh, Dad.
If Mom finds out, she' il have you thrown in jail.
It' s okay, baby.
You want a lift home?
- Of course I do.
All right.
You are heavy.
- Nice car.
- Hey, thanks.
Is that Mommy' s car?
Is she home?
That' s my step- dad' s car.
So listen to me.
I found a way for us to be together.
I don' t want anything to happen to you.
Everything' s going to be fine.
Everything' s going to be okay.
Just trust me.
- I love you, Daddy.
- I love you.
Come here.
Oh, God.
Okay?
Bye.
- I miss you.
- I miss you too.
Go.
Oh, sweetheart.
Come here.
It' s okay.
Go.
Go.
Who the hell are you?
- A friend of a friend.
- Shit.
Oh, fuck.
Fuck!
Hold it!
Stanley!
Go!
Oh, fuck.
Oh, fuck!
Don' t move!
Don' t move.
Come here.
Look at this.
What were you running for?
You arresting me?
For violating your parole by leaving Texas without permission?
Or evading an officer and almost getting me killed in the process?!
No, I' m not arresting you.
Then why are we talking?
- What are you doing in L. A.?
- Vacationing.
Vacationing, right.
The judge is allowing you to see your daughter?
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you?
Oh?
You just want to get right down to it?
Okay, fine.
I can help you with your daughter.
You help me, I' il help you.
You' il have to forgive me.
The fact that...... you put me in jail doesn' t inspire trust.
You put a virus in an FBI program and set it back two years.
They were reading ISP subscribers' e- mail.
It was illegal.
- I did what the judges wouldn' t do!
- You broke the law!
We both did what we had to do.
And your program is back in full swing.
Nice trip down memory lane, but if you aren' t arresting me --
Not getting a lot of cooperation here.
I ran into your friend Torvalds the other day.
He was vacationing too.
What are the odds of you being in L. A. at the same time?
I' m just a sucker for Disneyland.
We done?
Good.
Tell Torvalds I said hello.
You can tell him yourself if you' re not careful.
He' s dead.
Give me a card.
You think of anything to say, call me.
Sorry about your nose.
- You' re in way over your head.
- I know.
- You want me to watch him?
- Yeah, set it up.
I' ve had a shitty day so far, but I think it just got worse.
Either shoot me, or tell me why you' re wearing that wire.
Can' t do that.
Who are you, Ginger?
I can' t tell you.
Who are you?
He' il kill me if he finds out.
That' s not my problem, is it?
You' re asking for a lot of faith without giving me any.
You brought me into this mess.
I deserve to know who' s playing me.
Who are you?
I' m DEA, Stanley.
Holy shit.
We' re after Gabriel.
Give him the worm...... take the money and get out of here.
That' s all.
This looks friendly.
You know me, I' m a friendly girl.
Let' s get coffee.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Ever heard of Operation Swordfish?
- No.
Then you' il appreciate the irony.
Triple espresso.
- Two.
- Okay.
In the '80s, the DEA set up a network of dummy corporations...... as a front to launder drug money and gather evidence.
But these companies started to make a lot of money.
In 1986, when it was terminated, $400 million was in these accounts.
Money that just sort of disappeared.
It didn' t disappear.
It sat, earning interest.
That' s 15 years ago.
You know how much money that is today?
Nine and a half billion.
This is a sweet deal.
We go in over the phone lines, pop the firewall...... drop in the hydra and wait for the money.
Aren' t you getting ahead of yourself?
To access the cluster, you need a bank on the backbone of the network.
- Know how long that' il take to find?
- Not a problem.
Look behind you.
Cheers.
These fellows might wear Armani...... but they have the swagger of ex- military.
Maybe bodyguards, but they look like mercs to me.
Something' s going on.
They have two DS- 3 trucks.
That' s serious bandwidth.
Thermal scopes show a huge heat load.
Could be mainframes.
The house was listed by Celebrity Estates.
It was leased two weeks ago by a blind corporation.
No other info on them yet.
Wait a minute, Joe.
Blue shirt, pinstripe.
Oh, yeah, that' s him.
That' s our man right there.
Just in time to watch Stanley find our worm.
In college, I created the source code for the worm I use.
In the basement is the only PDP- 10 still active and on the Internet.
Not many people know it.
It' s an ITS machine, kept online for historical sake.
I hid my worm there, where no one would ever look.
Voila.
Good man.
Senator, we have a problem.
- Senator.
- Seems you' re in a predicament.
Is that right?
- I don' t follow.
- Download your file.
- Senator -- - You know where I got these?
From the deputy director of the FBl.
He thought I might be interested.
Sir, do you think there is any aspect of this operation I am not aware of?
We are aborting the operation.
Take a vacation.
A vacation?
Have I ever failed you, sir?
- That' s not really the point, is it?
- It' s my point.
You' re losing sight of our objective.
The risks are too great.
We' il seek alternative means of finance.
This operation is moving ahead.
Everything is under control.
Son...
... let' s just say you' ve got a 200- pound Rottweiler.
Now, he loves you.
It' s his job to protect you.
But if he bites you, you got to put him down.
Can never tell who he might bite next.
You understand?
Yes, I do understand, senator.
I think we got a team on the West Coast.
Fort Mac Arthur.
Maybe they should pay our friend a visit.
Come on.
Network IP range.
Confirmed.
Confirm.
Confirm.
We are cruising!
Oh, yeah.
Next.
And next.
Too easy.
No, don' t.
No, no, no.
Three percent, please.
Oh, fuck.
I' m fucked.
No, no, no.
Fuck you!
Shit, there' s no fucking way.
I' m rusty.
Rusty.
Come on, come on.
Okay.
Time to disguise you...
... as an internal destruction.
Quick, quick.
Thank you.
Return.
Three, two, one, go.
Come on.
Come on.
Yeah.
Close.
Yes.
Oh, baby.
Now I' ve just got to modify the code.
The bank' s IDS logs every packer...... that go to any port other than the 22 or 80 TCP.
Holy shit.
White, white.
Nope.
Come on, come on.
Here we go.
Twenty- six.
Ninety- six.
Nine --
Oh, shit!
What' s the matter?
You look like you' ve seen a ghost.
- We gotta talk.
- Let' s take a drive.
- Can' t we talk here?
- We shouldn' t.
Ever heard of Harry Houdini?
He wasn' t like today' s magicians, only interested in television ratings.
He was an artist.
He could make an elephant disappear in a full theater.
You know how he did that?
- Misdirection.
- What are you talking about?
Misdirection.
What the eyes see and the ears hear, the mind believes.
- What' s going on?
- We' ve got a tail.
Hold on.
Shit.
Jesus.
Jesus!
Take the wheel.
- What?
- Take the wheel!
Holy shit!
Who are those guys?
Jesus!
What the fuck are you doing?
Jesus!
Drive, Stan.
Move!
- I can' t drive this thing.
- Learn!
- Move it.
- Come on!
Hard left!
Hard left!
Keep going!
Go!
Get in the car.
Not until you tell me what I' m involved in.
Look, Stanley, I like you.
You' re on my good side.
But don' t confuse kindness with weakness.
You have 12 hours to get the hydra.
So get in the car.
Stanley, are you okay?
I just saw that maniac murder people in the street.
I' m fucking great.
You can' t leave.
It' il all work out.
You gotta trust me.
Trust you?
Yeah.
You' re DEA, I got the feds up my ass and I don' t know what' s going on here.
If we don' t find out who he works for, we' il have to start over.
That' s not my problem.
I don' t care who he works for.
What about Holly?
Do you give a shit about her?
Finish the job.
We' il get your daughter back.
I promise.
Ah, the great American outdoors.
Yet I never understood the appeal of fly- fishing.
A bit too much like masturbation for me without the payoff.
This is a catch- and- release stream, isn' t it?
Yeah, I believe it is.
You must see the irony in that, senator.
Chairman of the subcommittee on crime fishing in a catch- and- release stream.
How could you do it to me, Jim?
After all we suffered.
I' ve changed my identity so often I don' t know who I am anymore.
How could you do it?
We were so close to our goal!
The FBI was watching you.
You tried to kill me.
You' ve sold out America.
Patriotism does not have a four- year shelf life.
But politicians do.
What are you doing with that?
Thomas Jefferson once shot a man for treason.
Hold the phone.
Thomas Jeff --
- Stan.
How are you?
- Fine.
Finished?
Is this Stanley Jobson, social security number 669547311?
I' m calling from Credit Suisse to notify you...... that $10 million was transferred into your new account.
- As promised.
- Thanks.
So I' m done, then.
Soon.
Walk with me.
Against my better judgment, I' m going to tell you who I am.
- I know who you are.
- Do you?
I think you think I' m a bank robber.
But the truth is, I' m just like you.
No.
Because you' re a murderer.
That I am, and worse.
Rules I adhere to.
- Why are you telling me this?
- Well, if you listen, then you' il know.
I' il tell you.
To protect our freedoms.
I don' t care.
All I care about is my daughter.
I' m talking about your daughter.
You, your daughter...... and 200 million Americans who take their freedoms for granted.
I see.
You don' t know what it takes to protect our freedoms.
That' s my job.
To protect your way of life.
So you' re really stealing all this money just to protect little old me.
That' s right, Stanley.
Because wars cost money.
War?
Who are we at war with?
Anyone who impinges on America' s freedom.
Terrorist states, Stanley.
Someone must bring their war to them.
They bomb a church, we bomb 10.
They hijack a plane, we take out an airport.
They execute American tourists, we nuke an entire city.
We make terrorism so horrific that it' s unthinkable to attack Americans.
You' re not using the phone lines.
You' re going into the bank.
And you' re coming with us.
It' il all be over in 24 hours.
You' re a rich man, Stanley.
Soon you' il be on a yacht with your daughter, eating bonbons.
The American dream.
And just think:
You' il have done your small part in ensuring America' s way of life.
You' re a hero, Stan.
Don' t worry.
Let him go.
He' il be back.
Okay, load them up.
Let' s move out.
Let' s go!
Move it, move it!
Let' s move!
Let' s go.
Hands behind your head.
Let' s go!
Key, please.
What key?
I don' t know about any key.
Key.
Let' s move!
Back of the bank.
Now!
Let' s go, let' s go!
Down.
Everyone down!
Just wait here.
Hello?
Melissa?
Holly!
Oh, God.
Holly!
Baby!
Baby.
Baby.
Shit!
No!
Release the hostage!
- Help me!
- Let her go!
Let her go!
- Nick.
- Yeah.
- You all right?
- I' m good.
- That was your decision!
- No, you did that!
How many people die is up to you!
I want that plane on the runway in 25 minutes!
He wants a plane on the runway in 25 minutes.
My suggestion, sir?
You give it to him!
He wants a plane?
I' il give him a goddamn plane.
- Finish the job.
- Not until I see my daughter!
You want to see her?
Get him his daughter!
- Dad!
- Oh, Jesus.
Baby, are you okay?
It' s okay, it' s okay.
You son of a bitch.
You think I wanted it to come to this?
I' il sacrifice any lives I have to to protect this country.
Including my own.
Let her go.
And I' il get your money.
You finish the job, and you both go.
Come on, Stanley.
- I need the disc.
- Disc.
- How do you want it allocated?
- Spread evenly over the accounts.
Come on.
Done.
Give me my daughter.
- Verify this.
- Good.
Get her.
Okay, come on.
Stanley, hold up.
Good job.
- See you around.
- I doubt it.
What' s happening?
What' s happening?
- The money' s gone.
- Stop her!
Go!
Run!
Go!
She' s coming out.
Come here, come here!
What happened, Stan?
The explosion scrambled the internal clock.
No, it didn' t.
You fucked me.
You kill me, you' il never get a dollar.
The money jumps every 60 seconds from one account to another.
It' il do so for the next 10 years.
It wasn' t supposed to happen for another six hours, but hey.
- Fix it.
- Unfortunately, I can' t.
The accounts are encrypted with a 1024- bit cipher.
Even I can' t get through the firewall.
So here' s the deal:
Let the hostages go and I' il tell you how to get the money.
We all walk away.
Nobody gets hurt.
Deal?
I' m thinking.
No deal.
Get Ginger.
Move out.
- What are you doing?
- String her up.
Don' t do this.
- No!
Wait, Wait!
Hey, stay still!
It' il feel real good.
No, don' t do this!
- How long will she live?
60 seconds?
- You' re insane!
- Fifty- five.
- Okay, okay.
- Hope you built in a back door.
- Come on, come on.
Come on, come on.
Thirty.
Plane' s on the runway in a half- hour.
Good.
Twenty.
- She' s dying.
- Shut the fuck up!
Ten.
Nine.
Eight.
Accounts, accounts.
That' s it.
Three.
Two.
There it is.
Get her down!
- Check.
- Verified.
Bring her down.
Jesus.
She was DEA, Stan.
Move them out!
Let' s move.
Quickly and quietly.
- Go, go!
- Move it.
Come on, people.
Move.
Move.
No one wants a repeat of this morning.
Keep your distance.
Clear the air space for five miles.
They' re on the move.
Move, move.
What?
I know what you' re thinking.
If that launcher was a suppository...... would that bad man stick it up my ass?
Well, you eyeball me once more, boy...... I' il stick it so far up your ass...... you' il be begging me for this bullet.
If you don' t test your collars, this will all be over soon.
Let' s get this son of a bitch.
- How can you justify all this?
Here' s a scenario:
Could you do it?
No.
You disappoint me.
It' s the greatest good.
- How about 10 innocents?
How about 100?
1000?
To preserve our way of life.
No man has the right to make that decision.
You' re just a terrorist.
You' re wrong, Stanley.
Thousands die every day for no reason.
Where' s your bleeding heart for them?
You give $20 to Greenpeace thinking you change the world.
What country will harbor terrorists when they see the consequences?
Did you know I can buy nuclear warheads in Minsk for 40 million?
Hell, I buy half a dozen, I even get a discount.
Advise Joy 20 minutes ETA at the airport.
Control, please let A. D. Joy know we' re 20 minutes from the airport.
- Ready?
- Bird' s fueled, ready to go.
- What about your pilot?
- He' s in the works now.
All right.
Let' s do it.
Okay, I need a team over here.
The rest of you, let' s go outside.
Fuck!
Jesus.
What the fuck is he thinking?
- Aren' t we going to the airport?
- Misdirection, Stan.
What are you doing?
Where are you taking the thing?
You see Sugarland Express?
Didn' t like the way it ended.
Pull over before you get --
They can' t be serious.
Hold on!
Attention control, this has now become an aerial pursuit.
I' ve also got people across the tarmac.
Sir, I' ve just been informed that the bus is no longer en route to LAX.
- What happened?
- All right.
Let' s go.
Sir, the bus is no longer on First Street.
Then where is it?
Airborne.
- What' s he doing?
- We have a strong wind condition.
Tell him to climb!
Climb, goddamn it!
Climb!
Down!
Everybody down!
Add action or excitement, or change the direction of the entire campaign.
Maybe we ought to rethink the visuals.
Holy shit.
Secure a perimeter around the building.
I want everybody out of this lobby right now.
Secure the elevators and stairs!
Anybody coming out, detain them!
- The elevators to the roof?
- Up there.
- And the freight elevator?
- Rear of the building.
- That way.
Stan- man.
Take care of your girl.
Maybe I' il see you around.
No!
It' s not going to end like this.
Come on, Stan.
Not everything ends as you think it should.
Besides...... audiences love happy endings.
Stay here!
Shit!
Come on.
Move, move!
- No, Stanley!
- Come on.
Get him out of here.
Secure that weapon.
Let' s go.
Gentlemen.
You here to identify the body?
The dentals match those the Israeli government sent us...... for an ex- Mossad agent named Gabriel Shear.
Excuse me, sir.
The DEA has no record of any Ginger Knowles working for them.
I checked all the hospitals and morgues, and I can' t find her body.
Look again.
Bodies just don' t disappear.
Right.
He could make an elephant disappear...... in a full theater.
You know how he did that?
Misdirection.
I' m DEA, Stanley.
Give him the worm, take the money and get out of here.
What the eyes see and the ears hear, the mind believes.
Misdirection, Stan.
This is a bad guy.
Nobody' s going to miss him.
- You all right?
- Yeah, I' m good.
Why don' t you get out of here?
Go see your daughter.
Yeah, thanks.
We' il be in touch.
You son of a bitch.
- Thank you.
You' re done?
- Yes, I' m full.
Good.
Let' s go.
So, navigator, where' s our next stop?
- Holbrook.
- Holbrook.
- So what' s in Holbrook?
- The Petrified Forest, Dad.
- I think you take the I- 40 to the 180.
- Cool.
Alrighty.
- Are you okay, Dad?
- Yeah, I' m fine, sweetheart.
Okay.
Don' t worry, Dad.
It' s going to be okay.
- We' re going to be fine.
- I know, honey.
I' d like to transfer money from my employer' s account.
May I have your account number and password, please?
356126G.
Password:
Swordfish.
How much would you like to transfer?
All of it.
Evenly over these accounts.
It' s done.
The elusive bin- Hazzad was thought responsible for...... the U. S. embassy bombing in Istanbul earlier this month.
This is the third killing of a terrorist leader in as many weeks.
For weeks, rumors have spread across Mars... from outposts to settlements... from town to town.
Something that had been buried for centuries has just been uncovered.
And as this mysterious force moves across the southern valley... it leaves behind only silence... and death.
Take your seats, please.
They' d like to make a statement in two hours.
Some of you may not know we' ve had another incident.
Trans Marineris 74 Yankee... returned from the southern valley on autopilot.
Get to your security stations now!
Initial reports indicated it was a ghost train.
It appeared no one was aboard... until a single survivor was discovered in the rear compartment.
Lieutenant Melanie Ballard... second officer, first squad of escort police.
They were assigned to transfer a prisoner... from the jail at Shining Canyon Mine back here to Chryse.
Lieutenant Ballard was taken to hospital under guard.
She had superficial wounds, but was in otherwise good physical condition.
However, traces of an illegal substance, tetramonochloride... were found in her system.
Bring her in, please.
Lieutenant Ballard, please be seated.
Do I get a lawyer, or don' t police officers have rights these days?
Representation by counsel won' t be necessary.
Your rights are protected by the Matronage.
You can speak freely.
- Sit down, Lieutenant.
This is a discovery hearing... and your presence is required as ranking officer.
I want your after- action report.
Where' s the rest of your team, the prisoner you picked up?
What happened at Shining Canyon?
Last Friday at 1750, we were slamming through a dust storm... on the edge of the southern valley.
74 Yankee was an ore hauler... servicing the mines in the outer sector.
My squad was hitching a ride into Shining Canyon.
You beat me.
- Looks like you played tarts before.
- No, I' ve never done this.
Let' s spin 'em again.
You got the wheel up.
What' s your wager?
Five bucks.
Helena?
Hey.
Weather station' s tracking a huge storm across the southern sector... and we' re right under it by now.
- What' s the mark on it?
We should be there by 1800.
Just let me know if you need anything.
You high?
Fuck, Helena, it' s just clear.
I' il be straighter than this track long before we hit the canyon.
You better be.
This prisoner transfer is no sleepwalk.
- You mean "Desolation" Williams?
Deep solitary.
- What' s the charge this time?
He gets off every time on self- defense.
Sounds like he finally went psycho.
Beaucoup corpses, all mutilated.
Williams shows up at the mine with some bizarre- ass story.
- You starting to see the picture?
- And all we got is you, me... and this new guy Jericho and a couple of rookies?
What do you think of Sergeant Jericho?
I was hoping we' d get a good, solid woman we could count on.
I don' t know.
I guess we' il see.
I need you straight, Melanie.
Don' t worry about that, Commander.
I' m as straight as they come.
Such a shame.
Check on our transfer schedule.
Shining Canyon.
Shining Canyon, this is Trans Marineris 74 Yankee.
They ready for us?
I can' t get through to the tower.
Here' s your coffee, Mr. McSimms.
Just the way you like it.
You want some?
No, thanks.
How long?
About 40.
Shining Canyon.
Shining Canyon, this is Trans Marineris 74 Yankee.
ETA, 40 minutes.
Everybody check your equipment.
I don' t want any surprises.
Is everything all right, Lieutenant?
I couldn' t help but notice that charming little scene with the queen bee.
Yeah, well, you know how the service is, Sergeant.
She figures if I want to make captain, I' il have to pay the price.
Thing is, I don' t give a damn about wearing another bar.
It could be that.
Or maybe she just has good taste in women.
Sergeant, you are seriously out of line.
I' d hate to spoil my record.
All right.
I know you think you' re some pretty tough hombres.
You have the best gear.
There' s nothing routine about this prisoner.
We are here to pick up James "Desolation" Williams.
I want you all jack- ready and double tough.
Officers, you can disembark here.
What time is departure?
We need at least half an hour to secure our prisoner.
We got about a four- hour turnaround... and we' il be back at this spot at about 2200.
You can re- board any time after that.
Ed?
Ed, you out there?
Rookies, use your breathers.
Let' s go.
- God, I hate this thing.
- You' il get used to it.
Two years ago, we were still wearing full- face breathers.
It takes about a month to get over the headaches out here.
So this is Shining Canyon?
- First time in the boonies, rookie?
Seen one, you can go home.
You' re always cold, you can' t get a decent shower... and they don' t tell you that a one- year contract here... equals two years' Earth time.
You gotta read the fine print.
Where is everybody?
Friday night, the place should be packed.
A whole 12 hours before sun up, and there' s money to burn... whores to fuck and drugs to take.
Instead, we got a graveyard.
Maybe they' re all inside, spending their money.
Mel, I' il get us squared away at the rec- fac.
You and Sergeant Jericho check in at the jail.
Save some hot water for me.
Where were you before Chryse?
Utopia.
It' s the arse end of the universe.
A penal camp full of work- amnesty cutthroats.
Sounds nasty... but you seem to be holding together all right.
What you see is nothing.
I have numerous hidden talents.
Need some help with that?
You' re persistent, aren' t you?
I' ve changed a few minds in my time.
There' s not many of us breeders around.
I' d hate to miss a chance to give it a go.
What do you say?
Hello!
Anybody here?
Officer to front desk.
Well, hello, Mr. Williams.
No one seems to be about.
What do you make of it?
I don' t know.
What do you mean, pop the lock?
That' s a level- eight security door.
I' ve got a mystical way with locks and mechanical objects.
There isn' t a machine on Mars that doesn' t love me.
How about we check with the commander first?
So what do you do for fun then?
Are you a gambler?
I believe in saving my money.
Don' t worry about that.
I was gonna do it for free.
Maybe I' d sleep with you if you were the last man on Earth.
But we' re not on Earth.
It' s a voltage overload, most likely.
You want to check it out?
It' s probably nothing.
But on second thought --
Police officer.
Shit!
- This is not making me happy.
- It' s time to get backup.
Jesus Christ.
What are you doing?
- I almost killed you.
- What' s going on?
- Rec- fac' s a slaughterhouse.
Slaughterhouse?
That' s the word Descanso used.
I didn' t see it myself.
According to what Commander Braddock told me... right after we first arrived in Shining Canyon... she and the two rookies headed towards the recreation facility.
Mel, I' il get us squared away at the rec- fac.
You and Sergeant Jericho go and check in at the jail.
Save some hot water for me.
Descanso, sweep left.
Bashira, stick with me.
Officer to train, do you read?
The casino, barracks, dining hall, rec center, no one alive anywhere.
- Commander.
- I can' t reach the train.
- Well, keep trying.
How are we doing?
This thing was built to stay locked.
And Williams is still locked up?
What do you mean?
Williams was arrested on the suspicion of murdering... six rail workers and a payroll courier up at Klik 305 Hub Station.
The bodies were hung and decapitated, just like the bodies in the rec- fac.
So how' d they pin that on Desolation?
They made the arrest.
There' s got to be a day log here somewhere.
Sergeant' s desk.
Here.
Last night the mine called in a work stoppage.
- That' s what it says.
Anything else?
Arrest for theft, then nothing.
Got it.
What' s going on around here?
We haven' t had a meal or a piss break in six hours.
Descanso, open the door.
- Akooshay.
- What?
Just answer "here."
- Zimmerman.
I' m right in front of you.
Benchley.
- Who' s that?
- She showed up last night.
Insisted on being locked up here with us.
Let' s see what she has to say.
Somebody wants to talk to you.
- Who are you?
- Whitlock.
What are you doing in the holding tank, Whitlock?
It' s the only safe place at the moment, okay?
- Can I go back to sleep now?
I need answers.
What' s going on out there?
What' s your I. D.?
I' m the Spec Six science officer... in charge of the mining operation at Drucker' s Ridge.
I left Drucker' s about a week ago with a weather balloon I' d modified.
It seemed prudent to get out.
They said there was a riot and the place was destroyed.
Yeah, something like that.
I was adrift for several days, you know.
I followed the railroad tracks until I got here.
Oh, shit.
Then the storm forced me too low.
I hit a windmill and crashed.
And they were kind enough to take me in here.
Well, wasn' t that nice of them.
See if he knows anything about this.
Williams, do you know what' s going on outside?
Are you aware of what' s going on outside?
Let' s go.
This asshole doesn' t know anything either.
That' s Desolation Williams.
I heard he took out at least six when they cornered him at Deimos Station.
And this is eight inches.
Just goes with the territory.
Yeah, well, in my case, it' s a bit different.
Perhaps a connoisseur like yourself would appreciate what I have to offer.
Go get the commander.
Disarm her.
Officer.
It was almost like she was... possessed.
Like there was some kind of force inside her.
- Who was she?
- She was a dispatch officer.
We tried to make her comfortable.
The rookies took her to a storage room in the back of the jail.
Then the commander and I went back outside to look around town.
- What do you think?
- That the science officer is lying.
- Tell me again about Williams.
- I didn' t read the full file.
Caught him with the money, but he said he didn' t kill anybody.
They all died off right.
- Then cut their own heads off?
Put it down!
Call Jericho.
We' re 20 southwest of the rec- fac.
Don' t open the door!
Don' t let it out!
Who goes there?
I can' t fight it!
Commander Braddock!
There' s a man in there.
Open it.
I gonna need a cutting torch.
How long?
At least half an hour, maybe more.
What the fuck is going on here?
He committed suicide.
Before he slit his throat, he yelled something... something like, "Stay away!
Don' t open the door.
Stay away. "
And now the commander' s gone.
Maybe he was contagious.
Or crazy.
I say we take him at his word and leave him locked in.
Look, one of us has to stay with the rookies.
Why don' t you go back to the jail?
I' il find the commander.
Let' s get the hell out of this place.
There' s nothing we can do for this guy.
You' re right.
Okay, let' s go.
Drop the weapon before I cut this dyke bitch head off!.
What the fuck happened?
Bashira let him out for some food.
You unshackled him.
- What do you want, Williams?
- I wanna get the fuck out of here.
Just let the girl go.
You think I' m falling for that shit?
I can' t let you take the rookie.
Take me, okay?
Put 'em down!
Drop your gun, Descanso.
Yeah, drop the gun, Descanso.
Take it easy!
Just relax, relax.
- You' il get what you want.
- I know I' il get everything I want.
Now let' s go.
Damn girl, I like you already.
Shit.
You okay?
Just swell.
- Where' s Williams?
- He took off out the air lock.
I saw him go in not even two minutes ago.
He' s got your shotgun, right?
He' s still in there though.
All right, you two take the back door.
I' il go in front and flush him out.
If he comes at you, shoot to kill.
Now what?
How the hell did that happen?
- Let' s go.
- Wait a minute.
Looks like you' re coming with me now.
You see what' s going on out there.
You know I didn' t kill nobody.
- I said move it.
- I ain' t going nowhere.
You should let me go.
And I saved yours.
Looks like we' re even.
Now move it!
Let me ask you something.
If you' re so innocent, how come we found all that stolen flash on you?
I didn' t say I was innocent.
I said I didn' t kill nobody.
Okay, let' s say I believe you.
What exactly happened at K- 305?
I don' t know.
I was just changing trains from Camp Sinai.
Had a little time to get me something to eat... so I went into the station.
It was just lying there, so you took it.
You would have done the same thing.
See, that' s where you' re wrong.
I' m a cop, not a crook.
It' s a thin line between a cop and a crook these days.
You just got the woman behind your bullshit.
You look high right now.
You know I saved your life out there.
So why don' t you save mine and let me out of here?
Look... my job is to bring you back to Chryse to stand trial.
But that' s not my call.
So let' s not make this any more complicated than it has to be.
You can believe that shit!
I ain' t going back!
Soyou secured your prisoner.
Where was your commanding officer during this time?
I can only report what Sergeant Jericho told me later.
Jericho went looking for the commander.
Let' s get the hell out of this place.
There' s nothing we can do for this guy.
Yeah, you' re right.
Let' s go.
Commander Braddock!
Lieutenant, we got a situation here.
Sergeant, you' re breaking up.
The commander' s dead.
Everybody in the mine has gone insane.
Jericho, can you read?
Let us out of here!
Start at the beginning!
I got here last night.
Lieutenant!
What the hell is going on out there?
What?
In semiarid regions on Earth, there are certain organisms... that live in small pools that are formed by the annual rains.
But they don' t die either.
They go dormant below the surface... away from the hot sun until the next rain cycle begins.
Then they reemerge.
I think something like that is happening here.
I don' t understand.
Whatever used to live here, we woke it up.
It takes us, okay?
I' m talking about a kind of possession.
He said he found three people out there.
They' re on their way in and they got an ETA of five minutes.
You should get on the radio and talk to him.
- He' s found three people?
- That' s what he said.
- You okay?
- No.
Something broken?
I' m all right.
But it' s out of the body now.
Yeah, it' s loose in here.
Lieutenant, sergeant' s on the radio.
Lieutenant, we' re coming in.
Can you read me?
- Sergeant, where are you?
- We' re right down the street.
Who' s we?
Come on.
Open the door for us.
I tried to reach you on the radio.
Just you make sure that door is locked.
There must be 200 of them fucking freaks... and any minute now they' il be coming to kick our ass.
Okay, relax.
Who are these guys?
I found them hiding up in the mine shed.
Lieutenant, we got a situation here.
Sergeant, you' re breaking up.
I can hardly hear you.
The commander' s dead.
And everybody in the mine has gone insane.
Check the window!
They didn' t see him.
- Who are you?
- Who are we?
Who are you?
- The man asked you a question.
- My name' s Jericho.
At least he' s not one of them.
What' s happening out there?
What are they all sparked up about?
Used to be miners.
Then everybody in this place lost their mind.
Running around, chopping people' s heads off.
Ease up, man.
We were up on the rim when they called a work stoppage.
- What are they doing?
- Shit, I don' t know.
They' re knocking off early for the night.
How will we sneak in on a shift change if they knock off early for the night?
Shut up!
What the hell is that?
Let' s get the hell out of here!
We hid till the storm was over.
Later, I went out to take a look around.
I thought they were all dead.
Then some of them started to come to.
They walked around like they were confused or lost.
They was trying to help the others.
- What do you mean?
They act different, stand different.
Start cutting on themselves for decoration.
Filing their teeth.
Making weapons.
Killing the ones who hadn' t changed.
Cutting people' s faces off and wearing them for masks.
You lads got any weapons?
I mean real weapons.
Only cops can have guns.
There' s some detonators in them cases over there.
Do you know how these things work?
I know you need dynamite to use them.
We take our prisoner and we all get on the train.
And what prisoner would that be?
That doesn' t concern you.
Now drop your weapon.
Weapons on the floor.
So only cops have guns, eh?
You fucking pricks.
We lied.
Now go get Williams.
I don' t think so.
What was that?
- Fucking kill me.
- No problem.
Look, will you two stop fucking about?
Lieutenant, let Williams out.
Give me one good reason.
I just gave you about 200 good reasons... and they' re probably outside right now.
It doesn' t matter that Williams is wanted for murder... and it doesn' t matter that this lot are scumbags.
What matters right now is that we stick together to get out of here.
All of us... including Williams, including them.
Who are you calling scumbag, motherfucker?
Now quit with all your fucking stalling and take us to Williams!
I' il be goddamn.
Finally.
Man, this town done went crazy.
You like it?
I love it.
I want you to let him out.
What' s up, D?
I' m still shackled.
What, are you pigs on a fucking break?
I knew you' d let me go.
- It' s been a long time.
Piece of cake.
It was my plan, Desolation.
Fuck!
- I thought you was watching the door.
- Bitch, you better open this door.
- I don' t think so.
You don' t open that door, I' m gonna blow your head off.
Then your asses will never get out.
Someone will find you sometime... probably tied upside down in here with your heads cut off.
Tell your dogs to quit barking so we can talk.
Put 'em down.
Put it down.
Listen to me, Williams.
We don' t have a lot of time.
You need us and we need you.
We' ve all seen what' s going on out there... and none of us is gonna survive if we don' t stick together.
I need you to give me your word... that if I open this door... you and your boys will stand by my command at all times.
I never give my word.
It' s okay.
I never make deals with criminals either.
- You got it.
- What?
You making deals with cops?
And you are too.
Give her your weapon.
Everybody, give it up.
Well, introduce us to your friends.
These my compadres.
Uno must be the nice one.
You got that right, Butchy.
And I' il cut your fucking titties off.
Who' s in charge here?
You better let go of my arm.
Who is in charge here?
You!
You!
Shit!
Yeah.
And now that you' re done mopping the floor, get me a beer, killer.
What' s next?
We get more deputies.
You' re deputized.
Consider this a martial law situation.
Let' s go.
When did this start?
It started a few minutes ago.
- What should we do with him?
- We can' t take him with us.
Then here he stays.
Guys, what is that?
A black- market breather.
It has a 15 percent nitrous mix.
It gets you high?
It turns your brain into Swiss cheese.
- One gross of detonators.
- What are those good for?
It would help if we had some dynamite... but they make a pretty good bang.
We could put them in some food cans or something, make some hand grenades.
You got ten minutes.
Easy.
Here.
That' s beautiful.
That' s what you get, dumb- ass.
You' re gonna be okay to do this?
All right, it' s almost 2200 hours.
Here' s the plan, short and simple.
Everybody else follows.
Bashira and I are in the rear.
Any questions?
Put your hand down.
All clear.
Let' s do it!
Hey, bro, I don' t see no motherfucking train.
Hey, lady.
We don' t see no train.
It' il be here.
Let' s go.
That' s the mine office.
What are they doing?
Looks like they' re tearing the whole town apart, building by building.
Pick it up.
Lieutenant.
Hold your fire.
Just keep on moving.
Go!
- Where' s the train?
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
Lieutenant Ballard to the train, come in.
Plan A is fucked up.
Yeah.
It' s the same as plan A.
You got any fresh ideas?
Shit!
Come on, you mindless motherfuckers!
- Second time I saved your life.
Jericho, grenade!
On your feet.
Let' s move.
Shit.
Open that door.
We sealed the air lock doors, and Sergeant Jericho dismantled the lock.
They couldn' t open the door from the outside, so we were safe... for a while.
Try to reach the train.
Where' s your brother?
- He didn' t make it.
- Oh, God.
Uno was your brother?
Yeah.
Look at him.
Whatever is inside of him has waited a long time to get out.
I didn' t understand their design, how they move.
Yeah, the wind takes them.
And then once their hosts die... they drift along the railroad tracks from town to town, human to human.
What a perfect creation.
Vengeance on anything or anyone that tries to lay claim to their planet.
What did you see at Drucker' s Ridge?
I was at the mine when they called a work stoppage.
It was a Section 740, a "scientifically significant find."
A 740 applies to any number of things found on Mars.
A biological organism, an indication of water, things like that.
After we dynamited the mountain, we discovered an entrance.
It was a tunnel carved into the rock. it had been hidden underneath the outer walls for centuries... and someone other than man had carved it.
Jesus!
- What the hell was that?
- I don' t know.
Let' s get the hell out of here!
It was me.
I let them out.
I contacted the train.
- They said the tracks are blocked.
- Can they get through?
Yeah, they' re working on it.
- You okay?
- Yes.
- Barricaded the rear door.
There' s even a Rover parked out there.
Maybe we can make a run for it.
No, we wait.
They' re coming back for us.
Well, if a train comin ', they better hurry up.
What' s the matter with you?
You did good out there.
Yeah, right.
It' s a fucked- up situation.
I never put too much faith in cops, but you did all right.
You trust me?
Hell, no.
I really don' t understand you at all, Desolation.
The only one looking out for me is me.
Doesn' t that bother you?
Nothing bothers me.
Don' t you believe in anything?
I believe in staying alive.
Yeah, but for what?
I might let you know one day.
When?
When the tide is high and the water' s rising.
Doing okay in here?
Check this out.
- What about it?
- It' s pretty solid.
One way in and a back door out, leading to the rear entrance.
- A good sturdy door.
- So what' s your point?
It' s rather cozy, don' t you think?
I don' t believe this.
You lured me back here to seduce me?
Yeah, well, the way things are going...
I thought this might be our last chance to -- to dance.
Yeah.
Fuck him, whatever the fuck he is.
It' s out of him.
Get out!
Let' s take her out back.
What the fuck do you mean?
We aren' t moving her anywhere.
It' s taking her over, man.
There' s nothing we can do.
Easy, man.
That' s not her.
Come on.
Let' s put her down before they hear us.
This belongs to her.
- Where did you get it?
- I stole it.
It' s her stash.
This will mess with anything in there.
Bon voyage, Mel.
Let' s get the hell back in here.
I will not.
I was aware of having... thoughts... or memories.
Like I' d been invaded by something... and it was trying to take me over.
Something inside of me wouldn' t let that other thing take over and I fought it.
I didn' t know where I was at first, and then it hit me.
I was outside alone... unarmed.
The back wall' s been breached.
The back door' s locked and secured.
Let me in.
It' s me.
It' s Melanie!
Open the door!
Looks like her to me.
I haven' t heard any of these things speaking English.
Come on, Williams.
The tide' s getting high out here.
Give me those keys.
Come on!
Is it you?
Yes.
It' s me.
I had a glimpse of the Martians... of their minds, of what they want.
They won' t rest short of the destruction of any invading species.
As far as they' re concerned, we are the invaders.
Something' s kicking out there.
They made a battering ram.
Everybody to the rear of the jail.
You' re the second line of defense.
We stay here?
We hold them off as long as we can, then we fall back to the storeroom.
Soon as we kill one of them, whatever is inside is gonna come after us.
I know.
So if one of us gets possessed --
Leave 'em.
Here we go.
Party time.
- I' m out.
- I' m out.
Clear!
- Stand clear!
- Get out!
- Take them out back.
Get out of here.
Let' s go!
See if you can get someone on the radio.
Jericho, get this thing started.
Whitlock, unlock the gate.
Hurry up!
The train' s at the station.
- Officer to train, do you read?
- Where the hell have you been?
- Where the hell have you been?
- All right, Bashira, come down.
All right, wait for us.
We' re on our way.
Let' s go.
Get in!
Oh, my.
Go!
What the hell happened to you?
I' il get us out of here.
We' ve got to go back.
Slow the train down outside of town, then come to a complete stop.
No way.
- I' m giving you an order.
The answer' s no.
The answer' s yes.
Look... even if we get back to Chryse, those things will just keep coming.
We' ve got a chance to stop this thing before it goes any further.
This is about one thing -- dominion.
It' s not their planet anymore.
What about him?
Isn' t it our job to take him back?
Is he still a prisoner or is he one of us?
I can give a damn about saving this planet.
Seems like it' s been after me since the day I was born.
If I' m gonna die, I' m gonna die fighting... not running.
I mean, there' d be a huge explosion, right?
Then what?
Then you' d have a small atomic bomb going "boom."
I don' t know.
It' d blow out a radius of a mile, maybe two.
Would it kill them?
It would certainly destroy their human hosts, but as for them...
I don' t know.
Jericho, can you get us in?
I can try.
Sergeant Jericho, the science officer and I jumped off the train... and headed towards the powerplant.
The others stayed aboard the train as it backed into the station.
The idea was they provide cover... and distract the Martians as we set the charges in the plant.
And they' d swing back, pick us up and we' d all get as far away... from Shining Canyon as we could before the place blew.
Like I said, it was a simple plan.
The only problem was, it didn' t work the way it was supposed to.
- I' m working on it.
Hurry up.
We' ve got to remove the waterjacket and destroy the containment shell.
Where do I put the dynamite?
Officer to the train, they' ve spotted us.
Get your ass back here now.
Let' s go.
We' ve got to get out of here fast.
The Doc says the blast radius could be up to two miles.
- What does that mean?
- It means step on it.
Stay here and keep it full throttle.
What are you gonna do?
Lighten our load.
I think there' s some more dynamite in the rear car.
See you later, you big motherfucker.
You okay?
Say your prayers.
I didn' t know you was cut this deep.
Should' ve taken care of this hours ago.
You do that like a pro.
Me and my brother been through a lot of battles... ever since we was kids.
I never thought I' d go to war with somebody like you.
I know when you get to Chryse, you' il tell those people that I helped you... and I wasn' t the cause of all this mess around here.
'Cause I know they' re looking for somebody to blame.
I swear to you, Williams... as soon as I get back, I' m gonna tell my superiors about this fucked- up planet.
They' il drop the charges as soon as they get the report.
That ought to hold it.
When you get there, have somebody look at it.
I couldn' t get it perfect, so it might leave a scar.
I' m getting a collection.
You' il be all right.
- Yeah.
I' il get you a blanket.
What the hell are you doing?
What are you talking about?
Can' t let you turn me in.
I can' t let you walk.
What you gonna do, fucking shoot me?
There' s nowhere to run.
Anywhere is better than hell.
Catch you later.
Yeah, right.
And what happened to Williams?
I don' t know.
When I woke up, he was gone.
And you were handcuffed?
Must' ve done it while I slept.
At that point, I trusted him.
That' s all I know.
All right, Lieutenant Ballard, I suggest you get some rest.
You' re dismissed.
Is our statement to the Cartel going to be that Mars is being overrun by ghosts?
Attention, all police personnel... report to your nearest munitions station immediately... for weaponry assignment.
A security breach has occurred in the south quadrant.
This is a level- ten emergency.
All police personnel, report to your division sergeant for assignment.
All civilian personnel, evacuate the streets immediately.
Please remain indoors until further instructed.
Tide is up.
Time to stay alive.
If you ever wanna come to the other side, you' d make a hell of a crook.
You' d make a hell of a cop.
Let' s just kick some ass.
- Yes.
Purpose of your visit?
- Pleasure.
No? - ## [Continues]
Yeah, yeah.
[French]
You can put your things over there.
How long are you planning on staying?
Not very long.
Message for Mr. Smith.
- Smith?
- Yes.
Smith.
He' s here.
Monsieur, good evening.
Anything to drink?
- Water.
- Sparkling or flat?
Flat.
- A beer?
Oh, yes.
So, how are you, pal?
Just a little pre- takeoff takeoff.
Gives new meaning to "flying the friendly skies."
A serious drink?
- No, thank you.
- Where are you from?
- Beijing.
I love China.
It' s the best.
Yeah, the way they cut things in little pieces... so that you don' t have to use all that heavy silverware.
Not like us barbarians.
I mean, there we are, sticking our forks into the food... and hacking it up with our knives.
- Yes.
Mmm.
Great.
Men' s toilet, now.
You' re gonna have the time of your life.
Hands up, please.
My boss is dying to meet you.
You won' t need it.
You' re safe with us.
So, you came all the way from China to keep an eye on us.
- To help you.
- Yes, of course.
To help us, since we are so incompetent.
'Cause after all, what is our miserable history... compared to yours?
Since we have to work together, I don' t want to spend half the day killing your name.
- You got a nickname?
- No.
How about John?
I like that.
Richard.
Inspector Richard.
Welcome to Paris, Johnny.
So, what' s on the menu tonight?
They' re talking about the stock market.
Don' t ever keep me waiting.
Come on.
Let' s go.
[Chuckles]
Smile.
Welcome to gay Paris.
This is a few friends of mine.
This is Veronica, Susan.
Say hello.
Yeah, sit, sit.
Hey, cool it.
Hey, fuckin 'cool it, all right?
I think we have a situation.
One man, two girls.
- Yes, I do.
Want to go to Heaven?
[Whispering, Indistinct]
Let' s go.
- But, boss, the meeting.
I flew 12, 000 miles for a cocksucker of a contact.
He can wait for me!
I don' t know if I can do this.
Don' t worry.
- Hmm?
[Laughing]
What should I do?
Come up... and enjoy the show.
- Boss, we didn' t check the room.
- One minute.
Let' s party, big boy.
Let' s have some fun. - # Shake your ass #
- I don' t feel so good.
- No!
I told you, I quit.
- More for me.
## [Continues, Indistinct]
Everybody, out!
But, boss, we didn' t finish searching.
- Get out!
- Okay, guys, let' s get out of here.
- Okay.
Come back soon.
- Sure.
Oh, hey, Johnny.
Just in time.
- This wasn' t part of the plan.
- It is now.
Don' t worry.
It' s all under control.
He' il do his thing, then we' il do ours.
- Prettying up in the bathroom.
[Vomiting]
- Take me to Heaven!
[Moaning Intensifies]
- No!
Let me up!
She stabbed me!
The dumb bitch stabbed me!
Stay calm.
I' m dying.
- [Keys Clacking]
- We need to get him to the hospital.
He doesn' t wanna go to a hospital.
He wants to go to Heaven.
- Why did you kill him?
- The question is, why did you kill him?
Richard, look what he did to me!
Help me!
- Thanks for the help, Johnny.
I was just in here.
I felt a little sick, and then there was all this screaming and shooting and --
Shut up!
- There!
Everyone, down.
Everybody, back up!
I want him dead!
Everyone, down!
- He' s down in the laundry room!
- You, down!
But I think --
You!
And don' t think!
You and you, go to the next level!
You know, the Chinese have the best roasting methods in the world.
I prefer the French one.
Give me your lighter.
- [Grunting]
"Out of the frying pan, into the fire."
- Go!
- [Grunting]
- Yes.
All right, Johnny.
You wanna play?
Give me a green one.
[Shouting In French]
- Go!
You' re dead.
Shit!
- I can see that.
So what?
They show nothing but a fat degenerate with some hooker killing him.
- Except that -- - What?
One- One machine was still running.
Fuck!
[Shouting]
I don' t care!
Find it!
- Get the cassette!
- And kill him?
No, bring him to me.
I want him alive.
Go!
Nothing' s on one.
Shit.
Gare de l' Est.
It' s a train station.
Take the direction Bibliotheque until Chatelet.
You change.
And you take line number four and -- Yes, yes.
Okay?
Excuse me.
Thank you for coming.
In the name of the president, I want to personally apologize for this mess.
I want to stress that we would not want anything like this... to jeopardize the warm relation and successful economic ties... shared by our two countries.
So... we have assigned our best man to supervise this case.
And Teneriffe too.
- Inspector Richard.
Bonjour.
- Sir Minister.
This is Minister Tang, our liaison from the People' s Republic of China.
- The honor is ours.
The minister tells us you are the best of the best.
I might have been able to avoid this tragedy.
And hopefully, bring this matter to a quick and satisfactory conclusion.
If we could be showed the facts.
Please.
Uh, as you know, as soon as you informed us... of the criminal activities of the gangster Sung, we set our operation in motion.
We identified his heroin smuggling routes into France.
And in the spirit of cooperation, we graciously accepted your offer... to have one of your people, Liu Jian, come over... to assist us in Sung' s arrest as he was meeting with his French contact, who unfortunately we haven' t yet identified.
Here... he is surveilling Sung as we were waiting for the contact to arrive.
And here, he' s observing along with us.
And then, for some reason we still can' t understand, he went completely insane.
Left the room to pee, and next thing we know... he' s knocked out the bodyguards, killed Sung and the prostitute.
This is the gun he used to murder Sung.
Do you recognize it?
- Yes.
- Good.
Oh, we have also verified his fingerprints on the weapon.
Well, please, feel free to verify our findings with your own people.
We assume that your man was part of the conspiracy -- that he murdered Sung to keep him from being captured... and testifying in your courts, as you had requested.
But that is only an assumption.
We are hoping you could give us some background on him... which would help us in his capture.
Inspector Liu Jian was top in all his classes at the academy.
He received the highest training in martial arts, weapons and police tactics.
He' s been decorated for bravery in the line of duty six times, been promoted five times, and has never lost a case.
He has no wife, no children.
His only dedication is to his work.
He' s our best, which is why this is all so confusing.
Well, you know, sometimes the best are also the worst.
It' s really sad.
Any surveillance cassettes?
Destroyed as he made his escape.
Any friends or --
He has no one.
- [Cell Phone Ringing]
- Excuse me.
- I found the emergency phone.
Oh, that' s good news.
I' il call you back later.
Inspector Richard, we are very sorry... that the operation was sabotaged.
I will report back to my superiors and get you any help I can.
- Thank you.
- Let me show you out.
I want them followed.
I want their phones tapped.
I want to know every move they make, every word they speak.
Find him.
longer than you expected.
A little longer.
Paris is a nice city once you get used to it.
And the French are nice people once you get used to them.
- No.
Family recipe.
Very tasty.
- Did you try his hotel?
- The fuck never checked in.
"The fuck never checked in."
Even better.
- Who tried Chinatown?
- Here.
But it' s hard to be discreet.
I don' t care how you do it.
Get out!
I want that little prick in my office by tonight!
Oh, Jessica, my love.
Come.
Richard, I tried.
I really tried.
I was only in the bathroom for a minute.
You know, I was getting ready to do my part --
Getting ready to do what it was that I said that I would --
What you wanted -- I really -- I really --
I really was ready to do what it was -- what you wanted --
- [Whispering]
I know, I know.
Coming from such a quiet place as North Dakota, you must have been so scared.
- Richard, I tried.
I- I -- - I know.
I really did.
- I know you did.
All that noise.
My poor little farmer' s daughter.
Don' t be scared.
And you know how I treat my best girl.
I know.
So you' il keep your promise?
Promise?
Did I make a promise?
Yes -- Yes.
You said that if I did it one more time, that you would let me -- let me have my daughter back.
- Did I say that?
- Yes.
- Did I say that, Max?
Oh, yes, you did.
Two to one.
I guess you' re right.
So I' il have to let you go, you and your precious.
Do you realize how much I must trust you to let you go just like that?
With everything you know?
Everything you' ve seen?
I' d never do that!
I' d never give you up, ever!
I know that.
- What is he doing?
- I don' t know.
What are you doing, Max?
- He' s preparing a fix.
Do you want a taste?
Richard, I told you I quit.
You know I quit.
[Sobbing]
I don' t want it anymore!
I quit!
You don' t tell me when you' re gonna quit!
I tell you!
You don' t tell me what you want!
I tell you!
How long will it take for a fucking junkie like you to betray me for a lousy fix?
Please, don' t!
- "I won' t betray you!
- [Screaming]
Come on.
Come on.
Move your fuckin 'ass.
[Engine Starts]
You play mah- jongg?
A little.
I love mah- jongg.
Keeps the mind sharp.
It' s hard to find good players around here.
That' s why I play by myself.
- Bitch!
- [Groans]
I' m gone for five minutes, and you think you can park your skinny ass in my spot?
Fuck off!.
You want some more?
- Come on!
- [Yells]
- Eh?
- Ow!
That' s a long time.
- You stupid piece of shit.
- I have seven grandchildren.
- All right?
- [Groaning]
Get back to work.
And one big girl 14 years of age.
Almost a woman now.
She wants to come to Paris.
She goes to university.
Hey!
Go away!
Go away!
- Please.
- You don' t know these women.
They say they want to use the bathroom to pee, and next thing they' re shooting up.
Please, don' t draw attention.
[Mandarin]
Excuse me.
- No.
Oh, please.
I just -- I only have to pee.
I won' t be long.
No!
Okay.
What are you doing?
- I' m gonna pee right here.
Okay.
There.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
- But nothing else.
- I' m not gonna do anything else, I promise.
- Do you wanna check?
- Just hurry.
- I' m sorry to have to force you to.
It' s just I have got to go so bad.
I really --
- [Sighs]
Okay.
I' m Lo, the chef.
Oh!
That feels so good.
- How many?
- Uh, one, two, uh, three, four --
- I owe -- - Don' t worry about paying.
Come back later, okay?
Come back later.
Thank you.
Miss, you have to finish now.
Minute' s up.
You have to leave!
Miss?
Miss?
Please.
Miss?
- Only a minute.
Oh, that' s good.
- [Toilet Flushing]
Every 15 minutes they come by in a fuckin 'car, and if I' m not out there --
It' s just that I' m so tired.
They gave me this shot and --
Oh, my God.
Are you gonna finish this?
Did you make this yourself?
- Yes.
- Is that what you do, then?
- No.
- But you make these chips, right?
I love those chips.
Do you mind?
I love the pink ones.
My daughter loves the blue ones.
That' s her favorite color.
Miss, you really have to go now.
Delicious.
I' m sorry.
- Here.
One for you and one for your daughter.
Oh, my God.
This is so nice.
You' re the first person that' s been kind to me since I' ve been in Paris.
Look, I- I -- I don' t like to take things from people.
Usually I like to pay my own way, so... maybe later on, if you wanna, you know --
Thank you.
I don' t have any other way to repay you.
- I' m not your type.
Is that it?
I don' t have type.
Miss?
I' m sorry for hitting you.
That' s okay.
I' m used to it.
Kittana in one hour.
Follow me.
He' s on board.
Let' s go.
Tell me everything.
Richard, the cop in charge, set up the whole thing.
- He is the connection.
They recorded everything.
They said that, uh, you destroyed all the cassettes.
Except one.
Hand it to me, carefully.
The main thing now is to get you out of the country.
I have a car.
- [Gunshot]
He' s under the bridge!
Get out!
Block the north side!
I' il cover the south!
Go!
Will this be a problem?
With a billion of them, do you think they' il miss one or two?
The embassy' s asking for the release of his personal effects.
Send them a big wreath of flowers... with my condolences.
How much should I spend?
This much.
Here are your assistant' s personal effects, and here... are some photos of your hero killing another Chinese citizen... on the French soil.
There' s a time for diplomacy and a time for action.
Diplomacy is dead.
- Do you have a needle and thread?
You know, since I began my work...
I have received five of you young men.
Fast, proud -- like you.
Four have died -- the last one right in my arms.
Before my time is up here, I would like to send one home alive.
I' il go for some bandages and disinfectant for you.
Hi.
- No.
I have some experience.
You know, the longer that that thing stays open, the more risk there is of infection setting in, and then you are in for it.
I once had a scrape I ignored.
I let it go for a couple days.
- All right!
But only to sew it.
- Yeah.
Well, I don' t blame him.
If I were him,
I wouldn' t like me standing out there either.
Now, this is gonna sting.
Believe me, if I had any other place to stand, I would.
It' s just all the good spots get taken by the others and --
You would not believe how much business some of these girls do.
- I don' t know.
- Well, guess.
- I can' t.
- Sure you can.
Pick a number.
- Five.
Five?
How about 25?
- Twenty- five?
- Mm- hmm.
Well, I mean, that' s the record.
But at least 15.
- No.
Yeah.
Me?
I' m lucky if I can do five in a week.
- No.
- Not even once?
- No.
- Are you gay?
- No.
That' d be okay if you are.
I think everyone should be who they want to be...
- and do it with who they want to do it with.
- I' m not gay!
All I' m saying is, I don' t hold nothin 'against nobody that way.
- Are you finished?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Here you go.
Good as new.
Oh, my God.
Look at that scar.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
You did a very good job.
That was my specialty.
Used to have this big, fat mama sow, and she tore herself along the barbwire when... she was trying to get to the other side of the fence to get at these apples from the neighbors.
- No.
I go home as soon as my business is over.
- Shrimp.
Oh, yeah.
Pretty aggressive shrimp.
You should probably be more careful.
- No wife?
- No.
- Right?
- My work -- It' s hard to meet any girls.
Any interest in an ex- junkie hooker... who can cook, clean, sew and who likes Chinese food?
No, thank you.
I' m just kidding.
Hey, look.
My daughter.
- My angel.
- Yes.
[Sighs]
I met him after I had my baby.
And where I come from, girls without husbands just do not have babies.
And if they do, well, it' s kinda hard on 'em.
So, anyway, this guy I met -- He' s this French guy.
He' s really cool with this great accent... and always talking about art and books and movies and everything.
And, boy, when you' re, you know --
When you' re young and really desperate, you know, this --
You know?
And so -- I don' t know.
You know, and the next thing you know, you' re on the street.
It' s a little more complicated than that.
What do you mean?
See you later.
Lupo!
- Practicing embroidery on the clients?
No, no, he' s not -- [Screams]
Lupo, he was just -- He had a cut on his arm.
I thought he was gonna call the medics, and they' d be blocking off the street, and then the clients couldn' t come, and I couldn' t be standing on my spot, and I couldn' t make any money for you, so I thought if I just took five minutes, then --
Get back to work.
Lupo, he had nothing to do with --
I said, get back to work!
Excuse me.
I' m really sorry to interfere in your business.
But I would really appreciate it... if you... don' t do that again.
The little statue speaks.
You know, I don' t care if you fuck her, bleed on her.
You' re still using her time, and her time is my money.
You' ve kept her busy for 20 minutes.
- No.
Five hundred francs.
Five for her time, now five for mine.
Lupo, Lupo, we should get back --
Fuck!
What happened?
Down!
Fuck!
Damn -- F -- Oh!
Oh, God!
What are we gonna do?
Respect his wishes.
Listen.
The longer you keep information from me about this psychopath you sent over, the longer my city will bleed innocent blood.
I assure you, Inspector, we have kept no information from you.
Good.
- What' re we gonna do now?
- I don' t know.
- I can' t walk the streets all night.
- Walking helps me think.
- Walking hurts my feet.
- Then go home.
Oh, just like that.
First you put me in this mess, and then you think you can just get rid of me.
I put you in this mess?
You were the one who came to the shop to pee.
You were the one who offered to sew me up.
I didn' t ask you for anything!
I only asked to be left alone.
Oh, yeah, that' s you -- don' t need anything, don' t need anybody.
Just have yourself and your stupid job selling shrimp chips.
Yeah, I figured that out.
I mean, I' m stupid, but I' m not that stupid.
- I' m a cop.
- I' m Santa Claus.
Who is Santa Claus?
A big fat guy, red suit, flying reindeer?
Jesus, God, don' t you know anything?
Take me here.
Why do you want to go there?
Beginning?
Beginning of what?
My work.
- [Shouting]
You -- You were there last night?
Working with the French cop.
- You know him?
Yeah.
I was there too.
The redhead.
Yeah.
It was --
- Come on.
- Wait a minute!
- A second ago you couldn' t wait to get rid of me.
- You' re my proof.
I' m in deep enough.
I' m not gonna be your witness.
You' re the only one who can save me.
Don' t you listen?
Richard has my daughter.
No!
You don' t think what' s gonna happen to her, you don' t think what' s gonna happen to me.
Of course not!
You only think of your job.
Because that' s all that matters to you, because that' s all you' ve got in your crummy cop' s life.
You take Richard down, and it' s just gonna leave a space for another bastard, one who we pray will be less of a bastard than the one before him.
And that' s reality!
Maybe it' s not your reality, but it' s my reality every day, 24- 7.
And there' s nothing you or anybody else can do to change that.
Wait.
If I get your daughter back, will you help me?
I' m -- I' m -- I' m really screwed this time.
My government will protect you.
They will give you safely away.
To China?
I mean, I like the chips, but no, thank you.
Listen to me.
I know you' ve had some bad experiences trusting people.
But if I gave you my word, you will be safe.
Yes, Minister.
We' re doing all we can, Minister.
But we are not magicians who can pull killers out of hats like they' re rabbits, especially one who is trained like this.
I' il call you back.
Richard!
My God, Richard!
Try me.
I -- This crazy little Chinese --
Lupo picked the perfect spot, except it smelled like shrimps.
And how can I get any clients when I smell like a shrimp?
So anyway, I was trying to work, and Max and Lupo come along.
They went into the shop, and the next thing I know, the little fucker goes nuts, you know, and- and -- I mean --
Max tried to protect me, and the Chinese guy, he killed both of them.
I believe you.
And then he takes me as a hostage.
And, he made me carry this stuff, and he dragged me all the way up to that church --
You know, the big church on the top of the hill?
And then -- You know -- And he made me... help him do these things -- these weird things with incense and pajamas.
- And every time I tried to run -- - He stopped you?
Yeah.
You know -- You know those movies... with that Chinese guy who' s always kicking and screaming all the time and --
Yeah.
He did.
Look.
And then he made me go to this restaurant while he ate this goop... with weird things in it, you know, like snails and frogs' legs and --
That is when you escaped out of the bathroom window?
- In the restaurant?
He -- Yeah.
Richard.
Please, don' t -- don' t do that.
Do you think he is still there in the restaurant?
That' s why I came here.
- 'Cause I thought if I helped you -- - What?
I could show you where he is.
- You' re not too tired?
- Oh, yeah, for sure.
I could probably sleep for a week.
I --
I don' t know.
What do you think?
I think...
I should come.
I think you should stay.
Okay.
He' s -- He' s at the Mandarin in Belville.
I want you to trust me.
I trust you.
Wait.
And if I discover I can' t, I know where to find you.
What about my daughter?
She' s safe, just like her mother.
Watch her.
Okay.
Wait a minute.
What do you think I am, the village idiot?
First you go get my sandwich, and then I give you your dessert.
- You get it?
No, I always walk around handcuffed to a steam pipe with a turtle for company.
So you didn' t get it.
Is it just you, or do all cops lack a basic sense of humor?
Now will you help?
I can' t relax it anymore.
Come on, you know about handcuffs.
- You sure you got all of them?
- The deal was I get you all the tapes in his office.
Now are you gonna live up to your end of the bargain or what?
Hello!
- No, no.
No needles.
- No needles.
No.
Ow!
- How did you do that?
- Chinese magic.
- No.
- First we get my daughter.
Bullshit.
I' m not gonna sit someplace nice and safe while my kid' s life' s in danger, so forget it!
Which way?
She escaped?
What do you mean she escaped?
How could she escape?
It' s here.
- [Dog Barking]
It' s an orphanage.
- Do you mind?
- What?
Oh, no.
Shit.
Section "B," bed 13.
Okay.
I don' t know.
I guess I' m kinda nervous.
I mean, I haven' t seen her in almost a year.
Go.
- I don' t think so.
Somebody help me!
That' s for boys.
Don' t you have any Barbies?
All my Barbies are working.
I had a turtle, but your mother took it.
Soon, darling.
Very soon.
Calm down.
Everything' s gonna be okay.
But he has my daughter.
Don' t worry.
Everything' s gonna be fine.
No.
You don' t understand.
My life is not some fairy tale.
My life is hell.
Richard is the devil, and he has my daughter, and he' s gonna kill her, and then he' s gonna kill me.
And then he' s gonna find a way to get out of it clean.
You' re wrong.
They will arrest him, and they' il take care of you and your daughter.
"They"?
I don' t give a shit about them.
I don' t trust them.
I trusted you.
For the first time in -- God, I don' t know, forever --
I don' t know why I trust someone.
Yes.
I think you should sleep.
- [Jian]
- I want the cassette.
- I gave the cassette to my government.
- They will know what to do with it.
- Bad move, Johnny Boy.
Now that the kid has no value, what am I going to do with her?
She' s too young to work.
Maybe not.
- What do you think?
- I think you should come to the window.
I' m coming up.
He' s coming up.
Hey, monsieur --
Sound the alert!
Come on!
Get those out!
Move it!
This is not a drill!
Go now!
Ah, Johnny, Johnny, I' m disappointed in you.
Coming to Paris for the first time, and instead of enjoying yourself, you' re doing all this useless running around.
- Me either.
And right now I' m finding you very boring!
Wait!
- Ah, really?
- In the second... it takes for you to kill her,
I will have all the time I need to kill you.
I got you.
Yes, you did, but I also got you.
[Gasping]
Isabel?
- Can you wait outside?
- [Gasping]
Okay.
Good- bye, mister.
What did you do to me?
- That' s it?
- In a certain point, very forbidden.
It' s called "The Kiss of the Dragon."
Kiss my ass!
The blood from your whole body goes to your head.
It stops there, never comes down.
But soon it will come out from your nose, your ears, even from your eyes.
And then... you will die, painfully.
[Gasping]
You' re really a smart guy, Johnny Boy.
My name is not Johnny.
- Only a minute.
My daughter?
# I' il adore you #
500 years had passed, and still the land was closed off.
It was isolated from the world, and knew neither hope nor despair.
An atmosphere of total stagnation ruled the land.
The rebels who dared to start an uprising... were eliminated by the state.
The House Takemikazuchi... was a band of assassins, hired to quell this rebellion.
For a long time past... they were the bodyguards of the rulers from a neighboring country.
So they fled to this land, branded as exiles.
Selling their skills to anyone in need of effective killing.
The Takemikazuchi.
Mother.
Byakurai is looking for you.
Anka ran away this morning.
If he has deserted the Takemikazuchi... he will betray our secrets.
He wants to flee to the Shikon- mountain.
But with that leg of his, he won' t even have reached the old mine yet.
Yuki.
Take Kiri with you.
I go alone.
I' m going too.
- He will only slow me down.
Take me with you.
That' s what Byakurai wants.
Would you really kill Anka?
Of course.
And when he begs for mercy?
Even then I' il kill him.
I don' t think so.
Yuki, it' s you.
I' m unarmed.
Don' t kill me.
Please.
Take my sword.
Just tell them you' ve killed me.
Alright?
I see that I' m no longer a match for you, Yuki.
Who are you?
My name is Kuka.
I used to work for your mother.
I' m here to tell you something.
About the way your mother died.
You believe that she was killed in a raid.
But she was murdered by Byakurai.
You' re lying.
Byakurai is the murderer of your mother.
Azora, princess Takemikazuchi.
Or leave.
Tomorrow is your 20th birthday.
On that day, a princess becomes the leader of the Takemikazuchi.
You must take over the House' s leadership.
Or you must leave.
Should you decide to leave... come to meet me at the old mine.
With this i have delivered the message from Azora to you.
Did Anka beg for mercy?
Did my mother beg for mercy?
What do you mean?
Your voice is quivering.
You think feverishly.
Do you realize what you' re doing?
Tell me!
Byakurai.
Did you kill my mother?
No.
I' il overlook this incident.
I never meant to tell you this.
Your mother was killed, because she wanted to betray us.
And wanted to flee.
- Liar.
Stop it.
Fighting will only make this worse.
You leave me no choice.
Die.
Important news from the Assembly.
The ministry of Consumption reports... that the living- standard has increased by 20 percent last year.
To celebrate this news... the citizens took to the streets.
It turned into a spontaneous parade of rejoicing.
Aya.
What' s wrong?
You want to kill me with this?
You' re of the Takemikazuchi aren' t you?
Who sent you?
Tell me.
Where are the others?
And I don' t want to kill you.
You' re lying.
You expect me to believe that?
Trust me.
Trust you?
You' re prepared to kill anybody for money.
If I trust you, that will get me killed.
If it were you I was after... you' d be dead right now.
Do you trust me now?
Doesn' t that hurt?
- Of course it does.
If you allow the pain.
I saw a girl.
Where is she?
I' m alone here.
That bed is mine.
- Goodnight.
On the way through the forest.
Is that all you have to report?
No.
Someone saw a car.
We' re keeping an eye on the road.
She' il be back.
She wants revenge.
Somebody told her.
But who?
That' s the question.
Yuki turned 20 today.
Whoever told her about Azora must have known that and its meaning.
Kuka.
She wants to kill you, to avenge Azora?
Then she will be coming here.
There can be no doubt.
Suppose Kuka would want to speak with Yuki.
Where would he meet her?
Where he lives maybe.
I' d do it somewhere else entirely...
How are you?
It' s me, Kidokoro.
I' ve returned.
There' s something I want to talk to you about.
I' m coming today.
No, I will come to you.
The day after tomorrow.
Agreed.
I' il be waiting for you at the usual location.
A man once made a promise to Azora, heiress to House Takemikazuchi.
He swore fealty to the House.
But Byakurai branded him a traitor and killed him.
That man was my father?
You wouldn' t be able to remember that, you were only 2 years old.
The Takemikazuchi still had many members back then.
Byakurai wanted to marry Azora himself.
And make House Takemikazuchi his own.
But Azora refused this.
In her desperation she wanted to disband the Takemikazuchi.
But Byakurai found out about it, and ended her life.
That changed everything.
Many were dissatisfied with Byakurai.
They tried to detach themselves from him.
But there were only few who managed to escape.
Most of them had to pay for their attempt with their lives.
Only one or two got away.
This is the place where princess Azora died.
Undoubtedly she hoped for you to leave the Takemikazuchi.
She wanted you to succeed where she had failed.
There is no sense in seeking out Byakurai for vengeance.
The Takemikazuchi are doomed to disappear
Princess Yuki.
Your mother was tortured to death in this place.
But the final blow was dealt by me.
You may kill me now if you wish.
Since then I' ve been waiting only for this day to come.
I offered to join her on her journey to the other side.
But she didn' t allow me to.
Once you reached the age of 20.
Princess Yuki is the one who must slay me now.
Don' t say that.
That would be pointless.
So it was you, Kuka.
Soma.
My, how you have grown.
If you' il allow me...
This is what I' ve wanted.
Princess Yuki, do not die.
Kill me if you want.
But don' t raise your sword against princess Yuki.
I can' t promise you that.
I used to be cheerful all the time.
I never dreamed... that it would end like this.
Do you know why people thought like that back then?
Because nobody had ideals.
Certainly, people died because of our bomb at the Assembly.
But is was very effective.
You should be proud of that.
But it was a holiday.
The Assembly would be empty.
That' s what you told me.
Some losses are inevitable.
We don' t get it for nothing.
Mimura knew that.
He did not die in vain.
Nobody will pay us any heed if there aren' t any civilian deaths.
I want to move on to the next project now.
Sugimoto... thought differently.
Did he call you while I was gone?
Last month.
Sugimoto is no longer with us.
I have faith in you.
We must be prepared to do whatever it takes for our ideals.
Takashi.
Do you know what the safest place in the jungle is?
On the back of the lion.
The fleas on its back live an extremely peaceful life.
What the...
Where are you bleeding?
You need protein.
Otherwise you won' t heal.
Put this on.
It' s the only thing there is.
Hurry up.
It suits you.
What are you doing?
I' m throwing these away.
Have you seen Kidokoro?
Takashi, beware of him.
Have you heard about Sugimoto?
Kidokoro told me he is no longer a member.
He' s dead.
Murdered.
I' m leaving this country.
There must be happiness somewhere.
I' m trying to find that.
Who' s that?
She' s a guest.
A guest?
So you have found happiness.
Good luck to you.
Let me know, should you want to come with me.
Thanks.
Why did you come back?
What happened this time?
You don' t want to tell me.
It' s probably safer for me if I don' t know.
Is it difficult for you to kill someone?
Why do you kill people?
For the money?
My body moves.
When I' m holding my sword, and approach the victim... my body seems to move by itself.
Without any conscious thought.
Ah, poor you.
A monarch no longer wants to pay his bodyguards.
So they take their talents elsewhere.
You just kill people.
Not to defend your country, not to defend yourself.
You have nothing to defend.
You just kill.
But I did... have a reason.
to kill people.
A reason to kill.
Come.
My sister.
Everything was covered in blood.
Only she was still alive.
The perpetrators were acquitted, for lack of evidence.
So I killed them myself.
I was arrested.
I was put on trial and convicted.
I had a completely different view of the world than I did before.
Everything seemed different.
And then I met someone.
He told me... that he wanted to see me as happy as I had been before.
He was the only one who said that.
I did things.
I was forced to do things.
I rationalized everything.
Renkyo.
I need to talk to you.
About what?
Can we really kill Yuki?
Without Yuki... we will no longer have a leader of Takemikazuchi blood.
And then...
- Then what?
There are only very few Takemikazuchi left.
We' ve lost almost everyone.
But what reason is there for us to continue?
Without that name.
- We don' t need a reason.
There' s nobody for us to guard anymore.
I honored our ancestors.
I believed in the fatherland.
our swords were taken from us.
Some were imprisoned.
Their memories erased with drugs.
To block their fighting power... needles were stuck into their elbows.
Some of us have fled.
But never have we fought against the motherland.
Do you remember, Renkyo?
Those tanks on the southern island... that we encountered along the way?
Corroded by the acid rain.
The stench of corpses filled the air.
But there were no corpses.
The stench came from us.
At that moment... we were dead.
Hello.
It' s me.
Kidokoro.
Why do you call?
I' ve sent you some plans.
Could you have a look at them?
Sure.
I' il be right back.
Did you see it?
In ten days we' il make our move.
Are you there?
Ten days.
I can' t make it.
Alright.
When can you?
Never.
You won' t do it?
No.
I' il contact you later.
You always look so somber.
You' re expressionless yourself.
Have you ever been somber?
I suppress it, like pain.
And that' s how you can kill people?
When you' re somber... you mourn.
When you' re happy, you act cheerful.
Have you ever laughed?
When I' m somber, I mourn.
For hours.
For days.
For years.
Do you know what miki- ishi means?
No.
It means' beautiful gemstone '.
They' re very rare.
Even if you search for a year... you' il find one at most.
If you polish them, you will get a green crystal.
My mother used to collect them.
Whenever she had one, she' d polish it and keep it safely.
When she had thirty... she' d make them into a necklace for me.
For my wedding day.
She' d put it around my neck on the day I was to be married.
She started to collect when she was 18.
She had me when she was 22.
And she died when she was 27.
On the day she died, she had nine of those crystals.
In a little box.
Not enough for a necklace.
Soon I' il be as old as she was when she had me.
And then as old as when she died.
But I' ve collected nothing to leave behind.
To nobody.
I don' t have anyone to leave something to.
I have nobody.
Nobody to cherish.
Let' s go away from here.
Away from this country.
There' s nothing to keep us here.
There must be a place somewhere.
Away from here.
A place where we can forget everything.
Let' s go to that place.
Your mother.
I feel happy.
But will you ever be capable of feeling happiness?
I don' t think so.
Mother.
Now...
You will never know happiness.
Even if you' d kill me... you will keep walking the path of death.
That is unavoidable.
Kidokoro.
Your sister looks very well.
What do you want from me?
Is it about the plans?
No, I have a different plan.
It' s a very good plan.
You will like it.
What' s the plan?
We' il strike a bargain with the government.
We will accomplish our ideals, and there won' t be many casualties.
What do you think, Takashi?
Good plan, isn' t it?
You' re betraying me?
It' s all been arranged.
We keep quiet and our ideals will be safe.
Traitor.
We' il continue in spirit.
The plan that I sent you, would have been the last.
Because we' d all be dead afterwards?
Don' t talk to me like that.
It' s what you' ve always wanted.
You have it your way.
And so you keep out of harm' s way.
- We' ve made the deal.
It' s a good deal.
Then why did we do it?
Why all the casualties?
It meant something.
We believed in our ideals.
No, we all believed in you.
Manabe shot.
Kazuki tortured.
Mimura blown up.
They all believed in you.
You said we' d be happy again.
But that only goes for you.
Happiness will come.
But not just like that.
You knew the price would be high.
We pray for the victims.
Takashi.
You won' t have to pray.
Because you' re one of the victims we' il be praying for.
You bastard.
I' m Azora' s daughter.
Princess Yuki of the Takemikazuchi.
I claim your life.
Don' t you understand?
It' s over.
Scram.
I want to keep that.
Live.
Be happy.
Live for me.
I was orphaned at an early age
I had no name, so people called me Nameless
Being a nobody, I studied swordsmanship
After 10 years of practice, I acquired a unique skill
The King of Qin has summoned me
My deeds have astonished the Kingdom
By order of His Majesty we have brought the mighty warrior
Sky, Flying Snow and Broken Sword
The three assassins from Zhao have sought His Majesty' s life for 10 years
His Majesty has known no peace
To the astonishment of all a mighty warrior of Qin has smashed them
His Majesty can finally sleep at night!
We rejoice for our King!
This warrior sent from Heaven has exterminated the assassins
Summon the warrior!
Remain 100 paces from His Majesty
Or you will be executed Never forget that
Do you know why?
To guard against assassins
That' s why I am confined in this armor
You have removed a great peril for me
How should I reward you?
My service was for Qin, not for a reward
Achievements must be rewarded
Sky' s silver spear... wounded many of my brave warriors
Announce my edict!
By order of His Majesty he who kills Sky will receive gold and land and be allowed to drink within 20 paces of His Majesty
I am informed you' re a citizen of Qin
I am a Prefect from Leng Meng County
A County Prefect of only 10 square miles!
Surely the lowest- ranking official in Qin
How did you defeat such opponents?
I took them on one by one
Tell me the details
Does Your Majesty know Flying Snow and Broken Sword were lovers?
Yes, I do
And that they hadn' t spoken for three years?
For three years?
Why?
Flying Snow had an affair with Sky
Broken Sword never forgave her
Why haven' t I heard this before?
I went to great lengths to uncover it
To divide Flying Snow and Broken Sword I first needed to eliminate Sky
I have an idea of what you planned
Your Majesty is wise
What did you use to defeat Sky?
The sword
I' m in charge of arresting criminals in my county
On the fifth day of the sixth month Sky attended a chess house
I had learnt he enjoyed playing chess and listening to music there
So, the seven masters of Qin Palace
We are here to arrest you!
Identify yourself by showing your spear
Halt!
What can a minor official do?
This is my territory
So?
You are on the King' s most wanted list.
I am placing you under arrest
Old man, please play one more tune
Martial arts and music are different but they share the same principle
Both stress attaining a supreme state
SKy and I faced each other for a long time
Neither of us moved We fought the battle in our minds
How swift thy sword!
I thought I knew everything about my Kingdom
I didn' t know that Leng Meng County held a talent like yours
Broken Sword
Flying Snow
By order of His Majesty!
Flying Snow and Broken Sword have teamed up for assassination
He who kills either of them will receive gold and land and be allowed to drink within 10 paces of His Majesty
Three years ago, Flying Snow stormed the palace with Broken Sword 3000 elite troops couldn' t stop them
I' ve since emptied the palace so assassins cannot hide
Was your sword swifter than theirs combined?
No
How did you do it, then?
Disguised as a citizen of Zhao I sought them in the Kingdom of Zhao
I learned they were hiding in a calligraphy school under the names Highcliff and Springbrook
Rumor had it the Qin army would attack that day
Most of the townspeople had fled Only the school' s students remained
Why have you come at this time?
Who are you?
I' m from Yi County in the Kingdom of Zhao
My father' s dying wish was for one of your scrolls
I fear this may be our school' s last day
Which calligrapher do you seek?
I respectfully request Master Highcliff
Highcliff was Broken Sword
Legend said his skill as a swordsman was rooted in his calligraphy
So I had my concerns I needed to find out if it was true
What do you want written?
"Sword"
You are fond of the sword?
It was my father' s dying wish
What size scroll?
Eight feet
For that size I will need red ink
My master asked me to borrow some red ink
My master wants to borrow some red ink
Did you hear me, Master Springbrook?
Master Highcliff wants to borrow red ink
Tell him to come himself
Could I have some red ink?
The character "sword" was still being written when Your Majesty' s troops arrived at the city gates
Your Majesty' s army is invincible not only because it is brave but also because of its archery with a greater range than any other army
The Qin archers are like artillery Intimidating the enemy
Hail!
Hail!
Hail!
Please remember their arrows might destroy our town and topple our Kingdom but they can never obliterate our culture
Today you will learn the essence of our culture
Hail!
Hail!
Hail!
Those Zhao people didn' t flee?
They drew strength from their calligraphy
What was so difficult about "sword"?
There are 19 different ways to write it
I asked Broken Sword for a 20th way
Both calligraphy and swordplay rely on one' s strength and spirit
The 20th style would reveal the essence of his swordsmanship
How odd to write it in 19 ways
It makes the written language
Impossible to comprehend
Once I' ve conquered the six Kingdoms and all the northern tribes
I will eradicate this problem by mandating one style of writing
Wouldn' t that be ideal?
Your Majesty won' t stop at the six Kingdoms?
The six Kingdoms are nothing!
I will lead my army to conquer vast lands and establish a great empire
Hail!
Hail!
Hail!
Master Springbrook
Why are you going outside?
To fend off the arrows
You aren' t needed.
Stay inside
The Qin archers are powerful
You alone may not stop them
Hail!
Hail!
You are good
You are even better
You didn' t come here for calligraphy
Who are you?
I' ve travelled here to deliver an item
Please meet me in the library at midnight
Great calligraphy
Great swordplay
You didn' t even see my swordplay
I couldn' t have written without it
At midnight meet me in the library
Several thousand Qin troops were readying for the next onslaught
I studied the character all night trying to unlock the secret of his skills
It would reveal his swordsmanship?
But it' s just an ordinary word
Calligraphy and swordplay are similar
One must comprehend their true essence
Did you discover it?
It eluded me
So how did you challenge them?
Sky died by your sword?
Yes
Who are you?
Why are you here?
I' m from the Kingdom of Qin I have a message from Sky
Go on
He said he lived a life without responsibilities or commitments
He cared for only one person
Who?
Flying Snow
Sky was certain she' d avenge his death
To fight, meet me at the Qin camp
You can leave now
Go!
I know you saw us!
I let you see us on purpose!
I no longer care about you at all!
We were both very foolish
I' m not going to fight you.
Go away!
I will kill you in honor of my master!
You ask to die.
I will help you
Why do you laugh?
What you did last night was stupid
My plan proved successful
When Flying Snow was fighting me she was disturbed and disoriented
I defeated her easily
like Broken Sword and Flying Snow allowing their emotions to be a liability
It sounds as if you did divide them
Yes
In that case, they must have been petty and narrow- minded
True
Your story sounds logical
But you have underestimated one person
Who?
Me
Would you like my impression of them?
Three years ago they stormed the palace
I was impressed by their valor and dignity
Their character could not be petty
So Flying Snow' s affair with Sky is a lie
Their betrayal of one another is a lie
The story you just told is a lie!
Except for one thing Sky did know one of you
Who?
You
I surmise you two were old friends
And Sky' s defeat has only one explanation
What' s that?
He permitted it
To kill me, the two of you formed a pact using my men as witnesses
That was not hard to arrange
The hardest part was to persuade Sky to put his life in your hands
You were not fast enough to defeat Sky
He died willingly under your sword
Such devotion deserves true respect
He was the first to sacrifice himself for your mission
Sky was proud
What convinced him you could succeed where he had failed?
You have trained, perhaps for 10 years with one goal, my assassination
You have a great skill that few can counter
Killing Sky got you within 20 paces of me
So why seek out Broken Sword and Flying Snow?
I presume that your skill requires you to come within 10 paces
You needed a second sacrifice to claim another reward to bring you within 10 paces
Although Broken Sword and Flying Snow had never met Sky they instantly understood the reason for his defeat
How far am I from the bookshelves?
About 10 paces 10 paces is fine
I need one of you to help me
Please decide between yourselves
Meet me at the Qin camp tomorrow morning
How swift thy sword!
True
Sky was a superior warrior
He willingly gave his life to this man
He can kill the King
We must proceed
That means... we will die
Then we die together
You were one step ahead of me
Did I hurt you too much?
I should be the one who fights him
I want you to live
If you died, how could I live?
You will live on, promise me
Say it!
All right
Moon is on her way
I had better go
I am Nameless, Prefect of Leng Meng County
She is on His Majesty' s most wanted list
Now she' s here, I will arrest her
The assassin and I have an agreement to fight one on one
Should I be unable to defeat her please apprehend her
Your permission is sought
Draw your sword!
Hail!
Hail!
Make your move!
Hail!
Hail!
I die willingly
Make your move
Hail!
Hail!
Hail!
Hail!
Hail!
How swift thy sword!
I believe you and Broken Sword also fought
And like your fight with Sky
It was not real but rather it was a battle in your minds
A fight to honor Flying Snow
My master wishes you to have his sword
Why?
He and she are bound in life and death
They will never part, nor will their swords
It is his dying wish that you take his sword for your mission
Sky, Flying Snow and Broken Sword sacrificed themselves so you can be within 10 paces of me
All three gave you their lives
The best of friends could not give more
Therefore you are the most dangerous assassin of all
How did you uncover my plan?
The flames of these candles are disturbed by your murderous intent
All of you are willing to die for a cause
I' m ashamed to say I' m not that committed
Your Majesty has seen through our plan
If I had realized this sooner
I wouldn' t have allowed you so close
A citizen of Qin would not do this
Who are you?
A man of Zhao
Your Qin soldiers killed my family
I wandered into Qin and was adopted
I discovered my real identity 10 years ago and set my heart on this plan
You' ve come to avenge Zhao
I see
I would like to know
If your special skill has a name
As Your Majesty guessed there is only one crucial move
What is that?
"Death within 10 Paces"
"Death within 10 Paces" A good name!
All my guards are 100 paces away outside the palace
You are within 10 paces
It would seem that today I am doomed
But I sense your hesitation
You Majesty is perceptive
However you too have underestimated someone
Who?
Broken Sword
I needed to prove to them that my sword was fast and accurate
Within 10 paces my sword strikes with surgical precision
If it enters at precise pressure points it will not cause any fatal injury
If one of you would take a blow before witnesses, we can fool the King
Such a blow is hardly child' s play
How is Sky now?
Fully recovered
His trust in your sword was amazing
The King' s security is impregnable
There was no other way
His Imperial Guards were useless before
He should have died three years ago
What went wrong?
I abandoned the plan
The King must not be killed
He said that?
Yes
Why?
I also asked him
What did he say?
He would not explain that day
Broken Sword is the strongest among of the three assassins
He and I are probably equal in skills
What he told me later greatly unsettled me
While I' m alive I' il stop you from assassinating the King
I will help you
He let the opportunity go by once
This time, we must succeed
I will see you tomorrow at the Qin camp
Please do me a favor
Help me fight Broken Sword!
Master!
What are you waiting for?
Although I had agreed to help attacking from behind is dishonorable so I couldn' t draw my sword
But we both knew
If we did not stop Broken Sword we would never succeed
Moon, don' t!
You' re no match for him.
Stop
I knew this would happen
You can' t stop me now
Even wounded, I would still stop you
Then I will kill you!
Did I hurt him too much?
Your special medicine should heal his wounds in a day
Have you delivered it?
I tended to the wound myself
After the battle, take my sword and follow Nameless to see the King
Yes
They won' t treat a servant harshly
If the assassination succeeds wave a red flag on your return
If it fails, a yellow one
If something happens to you my message will be useless
I will smile from Heaven
If I see a red flag
How is Flying Snow?
Recovering
She doesn' t know I' ve come
You said you' d stop me
Please abandon the mission
You know I' m a man of Zhao
So am I
Doesn' t Qin want to conquer Zhao?
Yes
Isn' t the King the enemy of Zhao?
Yes
Who are you trying to defend?
You call yourself a man of Zhao?
Flying Snow has asked me that too
When we first met
I was living a carefree life
She' s the daughter of a Zhao general
Who died in battle with Qin
She inherited his sword
She wanted to avenge her father
I promised to help her
Calligraphy and swordplay share the same principles
We did calligraphy to inspire our swordplay and to heighten our powers
She knew I' d drifted since childhood calling no place home
Once we' d killed the King, she said She would take me to her home
There' d be no more swordsmen Only us
The essence of calligraphy is from the soul
Swordsmanship is the same
Both aspire to truth and simplicity
Gradually I recognised a greater cause
Three years ago we perfected our skills
Flying Snow insisted on going ahead
Together, we stormed the palace
She asked why I had abandoned the mission
I told her the King must not be killed
That is what calligraphy taught me
I didn' t kill the king
After that she refused to talk to me
Please abandon your plan
No
Was your sword forged in hatred?
Yes
For 10 years, the hate has only grown I can' t stop now
How can I dissuade you?
Only by killing me
Are you that determined?
Yes
Allow me to convey my conviction in three words
These words express my heart
Moon, give my sword to Master Nameless
Flying Snow and I will never part Neither will our swords
Master Nameless
Though I am just a humble servant
Allow me to say a few words
I' ve been with my master since I was eight years old
He taught me martial arts and how to be a decent person
Whatever my master does is for a good reason
The words he has given you carry a deep meaning
Master Nameless, please take his advice
What were the words he wrote?
"All under Heaven"
All under Heaven...
Broken Sword said
"The people have suffered years of warfare
"Only the King of Qin can stop the chaos by uniting all under Heaven."
He asked me to abandon the assassination for the greater good of all
He said, one person' s suffering is nothing compared to the suffering of many
The rivalry of Qin and Zhao is trivial compared to the greater cause
The person who really understands me is my most feared enemy
Alone, I have endured so much criticism
So many attempts on my life No one understands my intentions
Even my court officials see me as a tyrant
But I never imagined that Broken Sword, my arch- enemy would truly understand and appreciate my real motives
I would like to know how you mean to kill me without your sword?
By capturing yours!
This sword has protected me through all my battles
Having found a true confidant in Broken Sword if I die, I am content with my life
Let "All under Heaven" guide your decision
It just dawned on me!
This scroll of Broken Sword' s isn' t about sword technique but about swordsmanship' s ultimate ideal
Swordsmanship' s first achievement is the unity of man and sword
Once this unity is attained even a blade of grass can be a weapon
The second achievement is when the sword exists in one' s heart when absent from one' s hand
One can strike an enemy at 100 paces even with bare hands
Swordsmanship' s ultimate achievement is the absence of the sword in both hand and heart
The swordsman is at peace with the rest of the world
He vows not to kill and to bring peace to mankind
Your Majesty, your visions have convinced me that you are committed to the highest ideal of ultimate swordsmanship
Therefore I cannot kill you
Remember those who gave their lives for the highest ideal: peace with no more killing
Nameless went to within 10 paces of the King
He could' t fail
There can be only one reason He must have abandoned the mission
What did you say to him?
I wrote three words
What words?
"All under Heaven"
Is that all you care about?
And you
I don' t believe you
How can I convince you?
Draw your sword
You' ve misled Nameless
You' ve ruined Sky and the Kingdom of Zhao
Draw!
When we first met...
I had to prove myself to convince you
What can I do this time?
Just draw your sword!
Why didn' t you fend off my sword?
So that you' d be convinced
I always wanted to go home with you
Sadly, it won' t happen
Take good care of yourself
Why didn' t you defend yourself?
Why didn' t you defend yourself?
Why didn' t you?
No more drifting, no more roaming
I' m taking you home now
Our home
Your Majesty, permission to execute?
Permission to execute?
Your Majesty, permission to execute?
Permission to execute?
He conspired to assassinate Your Majesty
Show no mercy!
This is the law of Qin!
To conquer all under Heaven the law must be enforced
Set an example for the world!
Execute him!
Execute him!
Execute him!
Execute him!
Execute him!
Hail!
Hail!
Hail!
Hail!
At the beginning of the 21st century, the Umbrella Corporation... had become the largest commercial entity in the United States.
Nine out of every ten homes contain its products.
Its political and financial influence is felt everywhere.
In public, it is the world' s leading supplier... of computer technology, medical products and health care.
Unknown even to its own employees... its massive profits are generated by military technology... genetic experimentation and viral weaponry.
All Umbrella staff must wear their identity tags at all times.
All radiation badges will be collected at 5: 00 p. m. this afternoon.
God!
Some people.
Yeah.
- Don' t show this to me.
- Why not?
Because I' m busy.
It' s nothing.
Fire drill.
- What is that?
- Fire drill.
- Shit!
- Hey, what the hell is going on?
- Get the computers covered!
- Damn it, I' m trying!
Move them!
Shouldn' t the doors open or something?
It' s supposed to take us to the nearest floor.
What' s happening?
Line' s dead.
- What' s the problem?
- The doors won' t open.
- What about the ones at the back?
- Locked as well.
There' s no fire here!
No fire!
- The code doesn' t work!
- No fire!
- What' s wrong with you?
- The door won' t open!
- What?
- It' s a sealed room.
- Help me with the door!
- Oh, fuck the doors!
We have to get out of here.
What' s going on?
Has this happened before?
We have to get out of here.
- We have to get out of here!
- Take it easy.
- You take it easy!
- Quiet!
What is that?
Oh, my God.
Halon!
Stop it!
Stop!
Help!
Let me see.
We have to get out of this building!
Here, give me a hand.
That' s as far as they' il go.
They' re caught on something.
That' s wide enough.
I can squeeze through.
I' il get help.
I' m stuck.
You' re gonna have to push.
That' s it.
A bit more.
What was that?
It' s the brakes!
Get out!
- I can' t move!
- We have to get out of here!
Push her out of the way!
Pull me back inside!
Pull me back inside!
- Who are you?
- Move!
Don' t touch me!
Stop!
- Get away from me!
- Down!
What are you doing?
I' m a cop!
I told you, I' m a cop!
You' re breaking my arm!
Report.
Report now.
What?
I want your report, soldier.
I don' t know what you' re talking about.
Sir, the house' s primary defenses have been activated.
She' s probably still suffering the side effects.
What are you doing with us?
What about the cop?
Matthew Addison.
I' m not getting a match.
Who are you?
I just transferred.
They probably don' t even have me on file yet.
The locals are inefficient.
It' s possible.
Should I secure him here?
No.
We take him with us.
You can' t do this!
Blow me.
Prep for entry to the Hive.
Power' s down.
- So fix it.
- I' m on it.
Are you done yet?
Jumpy.
Stand clear!
- You got a problem?
- How' s that door?
- It' s sealed shut.
- Let me.
Jumpy?
Lie still.
Lie still!
Watch this light.
Follow it.
- Now, how many fingers am I holding up?
- Three.
Good.
Now tell me your name.
I don' t know.
He' s fine.
Memory loss, just like the other one.
Let' s open that door.
Listen to me.
I want to know who you people are... and I want to know what' s going on here.
Now!
You and I have the same employer.
We all work for the Umbrella Corporation.
The mansion above us is an emergency entrance to the Hive.
You are security operatives placed there to protect that entrance.
What about this?
Your marriage is a fake.
Just part of your cover to protect the secrecy of the Hive.
And what is the Hive?
Show them.
Accessing schematic of the Hive.
Raccoon City, nearest urban center.
The mansion where we found you... and through which we gained access to the train... which, in turn, brought us to the Hive.
The Hive itself is located underground... deep beneath the streets of Raccoon City.
A top- secret research facility... owned and operated by the Umbrella Corporation... the Hive houses over 500 technicians, scientists and support staff.
They live and work underground.
Their research is of the highest importance.
Its nature is classified.
Our position on the map is indicated by heat signature.
Why can' t I remember anything?
The Hive has its own defense mechanisms... all computer- controlled.
A nerve gas was released into the house.
Primary effect of the gas -- complete unconsciousness lasting anything up to four hours.
Secondary effects are varied, but can include acute memory loss.
- For how long?
- Subjective.
An hour, day, week.
So you' re saying this place was attacked?
I' m afraid things are a little more complicated than that.
Sir!
We' ve breached the Hive.
Got it.
Halon content has dissipated.
Makes it easier to work underground, thinking there' s a view.
Looks like we' re taking the stairs.
- Status.
- Red Queen is locked onto us.
She knows that we' re here.
Who' s the Red Queen?
State- of- the- art artificial intelligence.
She is the computer that controls the Hive.
This is gonna slow us down.
Our route to the Queen takes us straight through these labs.
Rain, J. D., see how bad the flooding is.
Kaplan, find us an alternate route.
What happened here?
Five hours ago, Red Queen went homicidal.
Sealed the Hive and killed everyone down here.
- Jesus.
- When we realized what was happening... my team was dispatched to shut her down.
Why did she do it?
That we don' t know.
But outside interference is a possibility.
Jesus!
You okay?
- Here.
- No.
- I' m fine.
- Please, come on.
It' s cold in here.
Are you --
Do you remember anything from before this?
No.
Nothing before the train.
And you?
Nothing.
I found an alternate route, but it' s gonna cost us time.
We double back, cut through Dining Hall B... then we' re right on track.
Sir, no go.
The whole level' s flooded.
All right, we' re behind schedule.
So let' s move it.
Come on.
Poor bastards.
Dining Hall B.
That' s what it says on the map.
Maybe you' re reading it wrong.
Maybe the corporation' s keeping a few secrets down here.
Something you' re not supposed to see.
J. D., you and Rain keep the prisoner here and secure the exit.
Sir, halon levels are nonexistent in this room.
I think the system malfunctioned.
All right.
There may be survivors.
Give me a search line, but keep it tight.
Move it.
- I said keep it tight.
- Sorry.
I' m not sure I want to remember what went on down here.
I don' t blame you.
What do they keep in these things?
How do I know?
What' s taking so long?
Red Queen' s defenses are in place.
She' s making it difficult.
Let' s pack it up.
You stay here.
The lights are automated.
Nothing to worry about.
- Transmitter in position.
- Roger.
Running the bypass.
Checkmate.
Move up.
- What is that?
- That' s what will shut the Queen down.
Delivers a massive electrical charge.
Scrambles the mainframe and forces it to reboot.
Some kind of dormant defense mechanism.
- Opening the door tripped it.
- Put it back to sleep.
Working on it.
- Would you open that door now, please?
- I' m trying.
Hold your positions.
Everyone stay calm.
What' s that?
- Kaplan, quick!
- We gotta get them out of there!
- Kaplan, you' ve gotta hurry!
- Come on!
Get down!
- Look out!
Something' s killing them!
Come on, man.
Don' t do this to me!
Medic!
- Open the door!
- Open this door!
- I am trying.
- Stay conscious.
You' re going into shock.
Stay awake!
- I am almost there.
- Sir!
It' s coming back!
- Open the door!
- I' m trying!
Well, try harder!
It' s coming back!
Oh, God!
- Just do it!
- I' m almost there.
Come on!
- Shit!
- Got it.
All right.
Let' s do it.
Do what?
We have to complete the mission.
There is no way I' m going down there.
Her defenses are down.
Déjà vu, anyone?
Keep going.
Give me a hand.
Get out!
You can' t be in here.
Don' t listen to anything she says.
She' s a holographic representation of the Red Queen.
You have to get out!
Modeled after the head programmer' s daughter.
She' il try to deceive us, confuse us.
I wouldn' t advise this.
Disabling me will result in loss of primary power.
She' il say anything to stop us from shutting her down.
I implore you.
- Implore away.
- Please?
Please?
You' re all going to die down here.
That pulse forces the circuit breaker to shut down her mainframe for 30 seconds.
After that, if I don' t have her board, she can reboot.
They' re late.
I' m on it.
J. D., we got a survivor!
It' s okay.
We' re here to help.
You seem to be in some serious --
Get off of me!
J. D., get her off of me before I stab her ass!
Are you okay?
She took a chunk clean right out of me.
Stay down.
I' m warning you, stay down!
She' s crazy.
Come any closer, and I' il fire.
I mean it!
Damn you.
I shot her five times.
How was she still standing?
Bitch isn' t standing now.
- What was all the shooting?
- We found a survivor.
- And you shot him?
- She was crazed.
She bit me.
She' s gone!
That' s bullshit!
She fell right here, but she' s gone!
Look, look at this.
There' s blood, but it' s not much.
Looks like it' s coagulated.
- Yeah.
- It' s not possible.
Why not?
Because blood doesn' t do that till after you' re dead.
Can we go now?
We' re not going anywhere till the rest of the team get here.
- There' s no one else coming.
- What the fuck are you talking about?
Wait.
Quiet.
Fuck!
Don' t come any closer!
They' re behind us.
Jesus!
They' re everywhere.
They' re all around us.
I said stay back!
Why aren' t they dying?
The tank!
- Let' s go!
- Hurry up!
- Wait!
- Come on, let' s go!
- Move!
Come on!
Move!
I can help you get the virus.
I have access to security codes, surveillance plans, the works.
Shit!
- We lost the others!
- Keep moving!
- You waited?
- Didn' t know the code.
Come on, come on.
- Shit!
- Come on.
- Come on.
- Hurry up.
- Come on, man.
- Shit!
- What' s taking so long?
- I' m trying!
Come on.
- Move!
What' s the code?
- Hurry up!
I' m running out of ammo!
Zero, four, three, two -- No, five!
- What?
- Zero, four, three --
- What is the code?
- Zero, four... zero, three, one... nine, six, five.
- Got it?
- See how easy that was?
- Shit!
- J. D., no!
Grab my hand, man!
Come on!
Don' t let go!
- J. D.!
- Rain!
Where are the bodies?
Where did they go?
Fuck!
Whatever they are, there' s too many of them out there.
Whatever they are?
It' s pretty obvious what they are.
Lab coats, badges.
Those people used to work here!
All the people working here are dead.
Well, that isn' t stopping them from walking around.
Well, where did they come from?
Why didn' t we see them on the way in?
When you cut the power, you unlocked the doors.
You let them out.
We' re never gonna make it to the surface.
You are security operatives.
Security operatives placed there to protect that entrance.
I' ve got one in the breech and an extra mag.
Lisa?
I can help you get the virus.
I have access to security codes, surveillance plans, the works.
But?
- But there' s gonna be a price.
- Name it.
- Who was she?
- My sister.
Corporations like Umbrella think they' re above the law.
But they' re not.
There are hundreds of thousands of us who think the same... all over the world.
Some of us provide information... others give their support.
Some take more direct action.
Like you.
If your friends had been a little more thorough... they would' ve seen right through my false ID.
Then all the red flags would' ve gone off --
Quantico, NSA, ViCAP, all the rest.
There' s no way I could' ve infiltrated the Hive.
So you sent your sister.
We needed something concrete.
Anything to expose Umbrella to the press.
Proof of the research that was going on down here.
What kind of research?
The illegal kind.
Genetic.
Viral.
My sister was going to smuggle out... a sample of the virus they were developing.
So how was she going to make it out of here?
She had a contact within the Hive, someone I never met.
They had access to security codes, surveillance, everything she needed.
So why didn' t she make it?
Maybe she trusted the wrong person.
Maybe they set her up.
Kept the virus for themselves.
Do you know how much the T- virus would be worth on the open market?
- What, worth all this?
- Yeah.
To someone.
Don' t shoot!
- Close that door!
- They' re right behind us!
Get off!.
Stop it!
Son of a bitch!
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Right behind us.
What about this door?
- They' re waiting out there too.
- And that way?
It' s a dead end.
There' s no way out of the Queen' s chamber.
So we wait.
If someone doesn' t hear from you, they' il send backup or something.
Right?
What' s wrong?
We don' t have much time.
You know those blast doors we passed... on the way in from the mansion?
They seal shut in just under an hour.
If we' re not out of here by then, we' re not getting out.
What are you talking about?
They can' t just bury us alive down here.
Containing the incident is the only fail- safe plan they had... against possible contamination.
And you' re only telling us this now, when we' re trapped... half a mile underground?
We have to find a way out of this room.
What are you doing?
- Where are you taking those?
- I' m turning her back on.
- That is not a good idea.
- She' il know a way out of here.
That homicidal bitch killed my team.
That homicidal bitch may be our only way out of here.
Considering the way she' s being treated, I' m sure she' il be happy to help us out.
That circuit breaker you were talking about.
- Can you bypass it?
- Yeah.
So do it.
All right, circuit breaker is disabled.
This time if I hit the switch, she won' t be able to shut down.
She' s gonna fry.
Kaplan?
The initial charge must have damaged her boards.
Ah, there you are.
Things, I gather, have gone out of control.
Give me that fucking switch right now.
I' m gonna fry your ass.
I did warn you, didn' t I?
Tell us what' s going on down here.
Research and development.
What about the T- virus?
The T- virus was a major medical breakthrough... although it clearly also possessed highly profitable military applications.
How does it explain those things out there?
Even in death, the human body still remains active.
Hair and fingernails continue to grow.
New cells are produced... and the brain itself holds a small electrical charge... that takes months to dissipate.
The T- virus provides a massive jolt... both to cellular growth... and to those trace electrical impulses.
Put quite simply... it reanimates the body.
It brings the dead back to life?
Not fully.
The subjects have the simplest of motor functions.
Perhaps a little memory.
Virtually no intelligence.
They are driven by the basest of impulses... the most basic of needs.
Which is?
The need to feed.
How do you kill them?
Severing the top of the spinal column or massive trauma to the brain... are the most effective methods.
You mean shoot them in the head.
Why did you kill everybody down here?
The T- virus escaped into the air conditioning system... and an uncontrolled pattern of infection began.
The virus is protean... changing from liquid to airborne to blood transmission... depending on its environment.
It' s almost impossible to kill.
I couldn' t allow it to escape from the Hive... so I took steps.
- Steps.
- You must understand.
Those who become infected, I can' t allow you to leave.
Whoa.
We' re not infected.
Just one bite, one scratch from these creatures is sufficient... and then you become one of them.
A check of my systems indicates my main drive circuit breaker... has been disabled.
May I ask why?
Insurance.
We need a way out of here.
If you refuse to help at any time, we flip the switch.
Understand?
After you.
What the hell is this place?
The utility tunnels.
They run underneath the Hive for water, gas and power lines.
- It' s been in here before.
- Keep moving.
- We' re going around in circles.
- This is the route the computer gave us.
- Why are you listening to her?
- Enough already!
We have no choice but to keep moving 'cause those things are right behind us.
That mesh isn' t gonna hold.
Keep moving.
Jesus Christ!
Hold it!
There' s too many of them!
- Jesus!
- Fuck!
Up on the pipes.
Up on the pipes!
Quickly, everyone!
- Let' s go!
- Come on!
There' s a way up!
Watch out!
Keep 'em back!
Go on up!
Move it!
Shit.
Okay.
Get over here!
There' s too many of them!
Go, go, go!
Go on!
Go!
I can manage!
Gotcha!
What?
We have to do something about your wounds.
I' m fine.
I said I' m fine.
Huh?
You like the way it tastes, don' t you?
Like the taste of that?
She was right.
No.
We' re getting out.
All of us.
Kaplan, are you okay?
Oh, God!
Hold on!
- Help him.
- I can' t.
- What are you waiting for?
- I can' t focus!
I can' t see!
- Kaplan, go up!
- Get up there!
You almost got it.
Keep going!
- Come on!
- You can do it!
You got it!
- Okay, Kaplan.
- Just stay there!
Hold on.
We' re gonna come get you.
Cut this wire and throw it to him.
Then we can go get him.
Hold on!
That' s lucky.
I want you to go.
- We' re not leaving you, Kaplan.
- Yes, you are.
You can' t kill all of them.
And I' m not going anywhere.
I want you to go.
Now!
Please.
Just do it.
Just do it now!
Please.
Go!
You' re gonna have to work for your meal!
Come on.
Give me your arm.
Up over my shoulder.
Ready?
There we go.
I think I' m gonna get laid.
You might want to clean up a little bit first.
Hey, wait.
Are you okay?
Blue for the virus.
Green for the antivirus.
- There' s a cure.
- What are you talking about?
There' s a cure.
The process can be reversed.
There' s a cure!
You' re gonna be okay!
I was beginning to worry.
This is where they kept the T- virus.
How do you know all this?
Because I was gonna steal it.
I was your sister' s contact.
- You betrayed her.
- I don' t know.
- You caused all of this.
- I can' t remember.
The truth.
I don' t remember the truth.
I don' t understand!
It' s gone.
It' s not there.
I can' t.
I just can' t.
It' s over.
I can help you get the virus.
I have access to security codes, surveillance plans, the works.
But there' s gonna be a price.
Name it.
You have to guarantee me that you will bring this corporation down.
Spence?
Thank you.
Spence?
We can still make it out of here.
Come with me.
We can have everything we' ve ever wanted.
Money' s out there waiting.
You wouldn' t believe how much.
Is that how you thought all my dreams were gonna come true?
Please.
I wouldn' t want to shoot you.
Might need the bullets.
Back off.
I won' t take any part in this.
Okay, but you can' t just... wash your hands of this.
We work for the same company.
You knew what they did.
I was trying to stop them.
You really believe that... people like him... will ever change anything?
Nothing... ever changes.
Where is... the antivirus?
It' s on the train... where you found me.
Couldn' t have been standing more than three feet from it.
I so nearly made it out.
Didn' t realize that bitch of a computer had defense systems outside the Hive.
In or out?
In... or out?
I don' t know what we had... but it' s over.
Back... the fuck off.
I' m missing you already.
Your boyfriend' s a real asshole.
He shot the locking mechanism out.
I can' t believe that son of a bitch is gonna get away with this.
I don' t think so.
I' ve been a bad, bad girl.
Oh, my God.
What the fuck is that?
One of the Hive' s early experiments... produced by injecting the T- virus directly into living tissue.
The results were unstable.
Now that it has fed on fresh DNA, it will mutate...
becoming a stronger, faster hunter.
Great.
If you knew it was loose, why didn' t you warn us?
'Cause she was saving it for us.
Isn' t that right?
I didn' t think any of you would make it this far.
Not without infection.
Why didn' t you tell us about the antivirus?
This long after infection... there' s no guarantee it would work.
But there' s a chance, right?
I don' t deal in chance.
Fuck it.
No pressure, guys.
You require the four- digit access code.
I can give you the code, but first you must do something for me.
- What do you want?
- One of your group is infected.
I require her life for the code.
The antivirus is right there on the platform.
- It' s right there!
- I' m sorry.
It' s a risk I cannot take.
She' s right.
It' s the only way.
You' re gonna have to kill me.
Otherwise we all die down here.
The glass is reinforced... but it won' t hold forever.
- Do it.
- No.
- Get up.
- Just do it.
- Rain, please get up.
- Do it!
- You don' t have long to decide.
- Get up, please.
- You have no choice.
- Kill her.
Kill her now.
You don' t have any choice.
- Just do it now!
- Please.
- Do it.
- Kill her.
- Just do it.
Kill her now!
Kill her!
The bitch wouldn' t open the door, so I had to fry her.
Move.
What the fuck was that?
It' s a long story.
Start it up.
I' il get the virus.
I' m missing you already.
Okay, we' re in business.
Full power.
We' re leaving!
I don' t want to be one of those things... walking around without a soul.
You won' t.
When the time comes... you' il take care of it.
No one else is gonna die.
Okay?
Here.
I' m not dead yet.
I think I' il have that back.
I could kiss you, you bitch.
What' s going on back there?
- Get us the fuck out of here!
- Any faster, we' il come off the rails!
Open the doors!
Open the doors!
Now!
I failed all of them.
I failed.
Listen to me.
There is nothing else you could' ve done.
The corporation' s guilty here, not you.
And we finally have the proof.
That way Umbrella can' t get -- get away with this.
What is it?
You' re infected, but you' re gonna be okay.
I' m not losing you.
Help!
Help him.
What are you doing?
He' s mutating.
I want him in the Nemesis Program.
Get off!.
What' s happening?
I want her quarantined.
Close observation and a full series of blood tests.
Let' s see if she' s infected.
Take her to the Raccoon City facility.
Then assemble the team.
We' re reopening the Hive.
I want to know what went on down there.
Just do it.
Who' s in there?
Let me out!
Let me out!
Who' s in there?
My face is on fire!
Help!
Hold still!
Hold still!
Doc, Doc, i\ x9Ds Foster!
Okay.
Does anybody have any more bandages?
Ernie, you hit too?
You hit?
No, no, I' m okay.
Our guys are gonna come for us, aren' t they?
Yeah.
When?
Plug his wound.
Tha\ x9Ds the main LZ, but i\ x9Ds closed.
Go!
Move!
Go, Parker!
Get up in there!
This is too Tall.
I' m clear..
Crandall' s clear..
Colonel!
On that ridge there!
Look!
Yes, sir!
Okay!
Keep your head down!
To the top of the ridge!
Move it!
Come on, le\ x9Ds move!
Move!
Run!
Come on!
Captain Nadal, we' ve got to break through to that cutoff platoon!
We got an American platoon out there.
An Air Cav platoon cut off out there!
Air Cav!
Garry Owen!
He said, "Really?
Me too. "
I said, "I know.
Your mama asked me to give you $600. "
Good luck to you.
Hey, you got enough room for one more?
Ifyou' re crazy enough, get in.
Yes, sir.
Hey, what are those lights down there?
Enemy soldiers.
They use candles on the trail.
They' re moving into position to attack.
Here we go!
Unload that shit!
Le\ x9Ds go, le\ x9Ds go, le\ x9Ds go, le\ x9Ds go!
You and your boys have done a hell of a job today, Snake.
I\ x9Ds the last flight for the night, but you need us, you call us.
Who in the hell are you?
I' m a reporter, sir.
Yeah.
Joe Galloway, UPl.
How' s it going, Colonel?
We' ve been flat to the boards since last night, and we' re outnumbered.
More enemy coming too.
I saw a chain of lights coming down the mountain.
Is that so?
Yes, sir.
Well, I can' t guarantee your safety.
Yes, sir, I know.
Where you from, son?
Refugio, Texas, sir.
Well, tha\ x9Ds the first thing I heard all day that makes any sense.
Captain, you see those lights coming down the trails on the mountain?
On it right now, sir.
You fry them sons of bitches.
Whiskey- Six, this is Trojan- Three.
Fire mission.
Tango Foxtrot:
4- niner- 6- 5- 6- niner.
All operations are suspended for the evening.
Morning operations will be scheduled for 0530 hours.
Where' s Crandall?
Where' s Crandall?
He' s right there, sir.
You led my men into a hot LZ.
Somebody had to fly out the wounded.
Don' t you play hotshot with me.
You know the rules.
You suckered us in there.
Do it again, I' il have you busted!
You got the balls to face me, but not the balls to face the enemy?
Get outta here.
Whoa!
I ever see you again, I' il kill you.
Tha\ x9Ds right.
Quite a day, huh?
Tomorrow will be worse.
If they make it to tomorrow.
Ernie, i\ x9Ds pitch black.
I can' t see anything, but I can smell 'em.
Dead bodies stink, Bungum.
No, i\ x9Ds not the dead ones.
I can smell them crawling up on us.
I' m telling you.
I need illumination, 6- 5- 0, 1- 5- 0.
I need artillery on previously established targets!
Alpha, Bravo and Charlie!
Fire for effect!
Fire for effect!
Save your ammo!
Cease fire!
Is anybody hit?
Captain, ifyou guys are coming you gotta let us know.
I\ x9Ds pitch black out here.
I don' t wanna shoot any of our own guys.
Savage... we can' t make it tonight.
Don' t worry.
You' re gonna make it.
We' il come get you in the morning.
Yes, sir.
Out.
You' re doing a fine job, son.
Don' t worry.
We gave them more than they gave us today.
How you boys doing?
Fine, sir.
You keep doing what you' re doing, we' il be fine.
Your men have done a hell of a job today, Lieutenant Geoghegan.
They won' t get through us, sir.
You can count on it.
I know that, Jack.
Keep it up, son.
I\ x9Ds Rear Headquarters, sir.
How is it out there, Colonel?
We' re surrounded, but we' re holding on, sir.
Sir, I need a confirmed count of our dead and wounded.
I got to know where all my boys are.
You' il get it, Hal.
Here they come.
Captain Edwards.
We need illumination on the perimeter.
Whiskey- Five, this is Hot Wire- Six- Alpha.
We need illumination now.
Kathy?
A telegram.
A cab delivers a telegram.
"The Secretary of the Army... regrets..."
Mrs. Moore?
Colonel Moore' s wife?
Yes.
I need help finding an address.
I' m looking for...
You jackass!
Do you know what this is?
Do you know what you just did to me?
I don' t like this job, ma' am.
I' m just trying to do it.
Wait.
Wait.
I' il take it to her.
And if there are any others, just bring them to me.
Julie.
I just went by to see Catherine.
Everybody knows.
No chaplains or counselors?
Cab drivers?
The Army wasn' t ready.
I' il go with you.
Thanks.
Who' s it for?
I thought she would hate me.
Your husband didn' t start the war.
They all knew this could happen, and so did we.
I' il take care of this.
I' il go with you.
We' il do one at a time.
Okay?
We won' t look.
Okay.
Julie... do you think there' il be more telegrams tomorrow?
If there are, come and get me.
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, amen.
Out of the depths I cry unto Thee, O Lord.
Lord, hear my voice.
Let Thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.
Thou, O Lord, shall mark our inequities.
Lord, who can abide them?
With Thee there is mercy.
Grant them eternal rest, O Lord... and may perpetual light shine upon them.
And through the mercy of God, may they rest in peace.
Amen.
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.
Do you got a death wish, Galloway?
No, sir.
Well, then why are you here?
'Cause I knew these dead boys would be here, sir.
Why aren' t you a soldier?
You got the guts for it.
My daddy was a soldier.
My granddaddy, two of my great- granddaddies was soldiers.
Hell, tha\ x9Ds how I came to be.
Each of them lost a leg in the Civil War.
My Great- granddaddy Galloway, he lost his left... and my Great- granddaddy Reid lost his right.
They met in a shoe store in Galveston.
Every year after that, same date, same store, they' d get together... and pick out a new pair of shoes for the two of them.
You are shittin 'me.
No, sir.
I swear to God.
Anyway, one had a daughter, one had a son... my grandparents.
What do you suppose the odds of them having the same shoe size was?
I don' t know, Colonel.
It was meant to be, I guess.
Yeah.
Meant to be.
Sir, Galloways have been in every war this country' s ever fought.
But when it came to this one, I didn' t think I could stop the war.
I just thought maybe I might try and understand one.
Maybe help folks back home understand.
I just figure I could do that better... shooting a camera than I could shooting a rifle.
Well...
I sure hope you make it through this one.
You too, Colonel.
Right 20!
Put it right on 'em!
Colonel, sir.
Captain Nadal.
Sir.
What is it, sir?
Nothing' s wrong, except there' s nothing wrong.
Best get back to the termite mound.
You' il be fine.
Go on.
Come on!
All right, pass the word on.
Every man fire three rounds at anything that looks suspicious.
On my signal.
They' re gonna hit us like this along the whole perimeter.
We gotta get back to that termite mound.
Better hang here, sir!
Shit.
We need a medic!
Sir!
Sir!
Captain Edwards, Charlie Company, on the ridge.
Bob.
They' re inside the artillery!
I need...
I need a grenade!
Go, Willie!
Come on, le\ x9Ds go!
Godboldt down!
I' il get him!
Willie!
Get those guys help!
Captain Dillon, get Bravo Company to send a platoon across the LZ... and support Charlie Company.
Bravo- Six, this is Trojan- Three.
And tell Charlie Company to get real small in their holes.
I' m gonna drop some artillery right on top of' em!
Charlie Company, get small.
We got AT coming right on top of your position.
We' re being overrun!
Nah, boys!
We' re gonna win this fight.
Yes, sir, they brought a main force ofVC battalion against us too.
Colonel, I request you dispatch another company of reinforcements... for movement as soon as it can be accomplished without undue risk.
Done.
How bad is it, Hal?
I\ x9Ds getting pretty sporty down here, sir.
Get out of the way!
Medic!
Get a medic over here!
Wha\ x9Ds your name, soldier?
Jimmy Nakayama.
I got a baby being born today.
Oh, wow!
Congratulations!
Thanks!
Medic!
Medic!
Can' t take no pictures lying down there, sonny.
Down, right there.
I' m a noncombatant, sir.
Ain' t no such thing today, boy.
Shit.
Why aren' t those mortars firing?
Wha\ x9Ds the problem here?
These tubes are red hot, sir.
I' m afraid we' re gonna cook a round off and blow us all up.
We can' t cool 'em off' cause we' re all out of water.
Come on!
What are you waiting for?
Jimmy, come on.
Go, go, go.
Yeah, one more.
Gentlemen... prepare to defend yourselves.
Grenade!
Stand by!
My pilots do not see the enemy.
They cannot pick out our friendlies.
Bravo- Six, say again.
You gotta tell your company commander to pop smoke now.
They need to mark the lines now!
We have no lines!
We have enemies and friendlies mixed in all over the place.
Sir, our perimeter is collapsing.
Alpha Company and Bravo Company cannot hold.
Net call!
Hastings!
Broken arrow!
Broken arrow!
I say again!
Broken arrow!
We have br. oken ar. r. ow!
Confirm.
Broken arrow.
Broken arrow confirmed.
Broken arrow?
That means that an American unit has been overrun.
It calls in every combat aircraft for support.
My God, there' s no hiding it now.
Charlie Company, report!
Signal is out!
Bravo Company, report!
Roger that!
Planes are on their way, Colonel!
Sir!
Roger that!
We have planes at every 1, 000 feet... from 7, 000 to 35, 000... we' il get 'em, sir!
Advancing north on our position at 1 - 5- 0.
Nine- six- two- five- zero- seven --
They' re getting closer in on 3- 1 - 5 degrees!
Tha\ x9Ds 0- 5- 0!
Repeat, 0- 5- 0!
Goddamn it.
Company sighted out in the open, advancing north on our position.
They' re advancing on 3- 1 - 5 degrees at 1 - 5- 0.
Bring it closer in on 3- 1 - 5 degrees at 0- 5- 0...
Charlie, call that son of a bitch off!
Call an abort now!
Pull up!
Get down!
Charlie, listen to me.
You' re keeping us alive now.
You forget about that one and you keep 'em coming in.
You' re doing well, son.
Seven- oh- two...
Attack against the tree line.
Medic!
Medic!
Oh, God!
Jimmy.
You know this guy?
You know him?
Talk to him.
Just talk to him!
Jimmy, do you hear me?
I\ x9Ds Joe.
I\ x9Ds Joe Galloway.
Doc' s giving you morphine.
We' re gonna get you out of here.
We gotta get him to the landing zone.
Grab his legs!
You gotta get him out of here.
Hey!
Hey!
I can' t help you!
You gotta do it by yourself!
Get him on that chopper, okay?
Yes, sir.
Tell my wife I love her... and my baby!
You tell' em!
Captain Nadal.
Sir...
Now that we put 'em back on their heels, we got us a lull.
I want you to attack.
I want you to go overthere and rescue that cut off platoon.
Yes, sir!
First Squad, move out!
Come on, guys.
Move it!
Add fifty.
Keep moving the artillery forward!
Keep walking the artillery forward!
Spread it out!
Move it!
Move it!
Keep moving forward!
Sergeant Savage, you guys still here?
We have 40 KlA, we have two MlA.
These are the latest numbers.
Over.
Tha\ x9Ds a nice day, Sergeant Savage.
Forty dead, two unaccounted for, sir.
Right.
All right, boys, le\ x9Ds get 'em up and get' em out.
Le\ x9Ds get 'em out of here and get' em on the chopper!
Since most of the men being loaded on the chopper... are from Charlie Company...
I want you to take their place.
I' il show you where.
Follow me.
Yes, sir!
Le\ x9Ds go!
Captain, have your men dig some firing steps.
Throw some dirt on those bodies, keep the smell down.
Roger, Sergeant Major.
Kind of makes you wish you' d signed up for submarines, don' t it?
Brigade headquarters wants you out on the first chopper at dawn.
What idiot would keep ordering that in the middle of a goddamn battle?
Gen. Westmoreland wants a briefing.
Give me the horn.
I am in a fight... and I object to this order to return to Saigon.
Now, I will not leave my men.
Is that clear?
Out.
There' s two of my men unaccounted for out there... and i\ x9Ds where the worst of the fighting was... so they' il be out there someplace.
Le\ x9Ds go out and get 'em.
I' m with you, sir.
All right.
Le\ x9Ds go.
They... brought another...
Oh, God.
Julie, i\ x9Ds yours.
He died keeping my promise.
Sir, they' re ordering us all out.
All of us.
They' re gonna march reinforcements in.
They don' t understand a damn thing, do they?
Can' t get out.
He' s waiting up there in a cave, and tha\ x9Ds what he wants.
The minute he sees live soldiers hopping on a helicopter... he' il be all over us and then he' il get what he wants.
He' il get his massacre.
Requesting permission to rejoin the lines, sir.
All right, son.
Garry Owen, sir.
I wonder what was going through Custer' s mind when he realized... he' d led his men into a slaughter.
Sir, Custer was a pussy.
You ain' t.
Goddamn.
Hell.
Right now they' re planning their final attack... the one that will finish us off.
They' il nibble at us all night, then... come dawn they' il hit us with everything they got.
Tha\ x9Ds what I' d do if I was him.
Sergeant Major, hand out the last of the ammunition.
Yes, sir.
Fix bayonets.
You were wondering how Custer felt, sir.
You ought to ask him.
Sergeant Savage!
Checking the dead enemies for documents... and I found this on the guy that tried to bayonet you.
Translated some of it, mostly personal.
Thought you might wanna have a look at it.
What was that?
I\ x9Ds American artillery.
Friendly fire.
How many casualties?
What the hell happened here, Joe?
Hey, Joe.
Colonel Moore!
Colonel!
Colonel Moore!
What is the key to your victory?
Sir, tell us how you feel.
Do you feel the States will be forced... to take the North Vietnamese more seriously?
How do you feel about the loss ofyour men, sir?
Have you notified the families, sir?
I' m glad you made it, son.
Thankyou, sir.
You too.
I' il never forgive myself.
For what, sir?
That my men...
That my men died and I didn' t.
Sir, I don' t...
I don' t know how to tell this story.
Well, you got to, Joe.
You tell the American people what these men did here.
You tell 'em how my troopers died.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
All of our men, living and dead, are off the field, sir.
Well done, Sergeant Major.
In Saigon, Hal Moore' s superiors congratulated him... for killing over 1800 enemy soldiers.
Then ordered him to lead the men of the 7th Cavalry... back into the Valley of Death.
He led them... and fought beside them... for 235 more days.
Kids, go to bed.
Isn' t there someone at the door?
Go to bed!
Children, your daddy' s home!
Daddy!
Some had families waiting.
For others, their only family would be the men they bled beside.
There were no bands, no flags... no honor guards to welcome them home.
They went to war because their country ordered them to.
But in the end they fought not for their country or their flag.
They fought for each other...
Dear Barbara...
I have no words to express to you my sadness of the loss of Jack.
The world is a lesser place without him.
But I know he is with God and the angels.
And even heaven is improved by his presence there.
I know you, too, are sure of this... and yet this knowledge can' t diminish his loss... and your grief.
With abiding respect and affection, Hal Moore.
We who have seen war... will never stop seeing it.
In the silence of the night, we will always hear the screams.
So this is our story... for we were soldiers once... and young.
Your friend is late.
He' il be here.
Oh, yeah?
I do have other bidders.
I personally vouch for this man.
Oh, well, I trust you, Michael, but... yousee, with each degree of separation... comes a degree of uncertainty.
Mr. Turner.
Mr. Vas.
The KGB once tried to set me up... so I had to kill three of their agents... and then I hunted down their families.
The point is, if I sense anything out of the ordinary --...
No, the point is, I haven' t seen anything from youyet... to justify a payment of $20 million.
So, before I hand over a small fortune... and risk my life, I want to know 100%... that youcan, in fact, deliver the device.
That' s the point.
Very well.
Michelle... owner' s manual.
This is your show of good faith?
Well, you' re still alive.
Youconsider that a show of good faith.
- Down payment -- $1 million.
So, when do I get the device?
Let' s say ten days.
VAS:
Michael, youtake that telephone... and I will call you and tell youhow to proceed.
Youkeep it on youall the time.
As for you, sir, the next time we meet...
I suggest yoube on time.
Nice coat.
Well done.
See youaround.
- Yeah, so far.
- Kevin' s got a tail.
- ls it Vas?
They don' t look Russian, but they don' t look friendly.
We' d better go back for him.
Youordered us not to jeopardize our cover, sir.
Hey, turn left.
Turn left!
Kill him!
- Come on, faster....
Let' s go!
Get down!
Get down!
There he is!
Pull over!
You' re jeopardizing the mission.
Youare the mission.
God, that was close.
Did yousee who they were?
Kevin?
Doesn' t this all smack of extreme desperation?
A nuclear bomb that fits neatly into a carry- on suitcase?
Kevin spends two years getting close to these people... in order to position you as the buyer.
Vas won' t deal with anyone else... and we have nine days to make this work.
I' d say desperation was the order of the day.
Maybe Vas set Kevin up.
My guess is, it' s a rival buyer.
Could be Pakistanis, Chechnyans, North Koreans.
- Libyans.
- Try the entire Middle East.
Adrik Vas is a businessman.
He' il take anyone' s money.
Why kill Kevin if they could just outbid him?
We have deeper pockets.
He priced them out of the game.
- Who do youthink it is?
- Well, the cold war is over.
These guys don' t wave flags anymore... and fanaticism, terrorism is global.
Whoever it is decided to eliminate the competition... and force Vas to deal with them.
OAKES:
So, the future of the so- called free world... may rest in this young man' s hands.
Jake Hayes here -- Big- time Tickets.

[Beep]

Big- time Tickets.
Jake Hayes.
What youwant?
Checkmate.
"Lion King"?
I can' t do that.
Jake Hayes here.
Big- time Tickets.

[Beep]
Big- time Tickets.

Youalways workin '.

OK, I' m gonna pick youup from work.
Then we' il talk all about it.
Love you, too.
Bye.
I gotta pick up my girl, man.
So check this out -- you' re gonna do this, right?
You' re gonna do this.
I' m gonna do this.
Then you' re gonna do this.
But I' m gonna do this... and when you' re thinkin 'about this...
I' m gonna do this.
Then the game' s over.
- and we' il save twenty minutes?
- Screw you.
Youdidn' t know chess was a contact sport, did you?
Hey, honey.
MAN:
She' s a nurse' s aide.
They' ve been together three years.
She lives with her sister and brother- in- law... in Jersey City.
Amazing resemblance to Kevin, sir.
[Tape winding back]
Like seeing a ghost.
I don' t know how you' re gonna react.
Come on.
Wait a minute.
I should' ve known.
The mood swings, the weight gain.
What weight gain?
You' re pregnant.
I want everybody to know.
Hey, everybody!
My woman' s havin 'a baby, and we' re gettin' married!
I' m not pregnant.
We don' t have to get married.
Marriage is a big step.
We should wait a while.
We' re young.
I' m moving to Seattle.
Seattle, like, Seattle Supersonics, Seattle?
Wait a minute.
That' s pretty far.
I got offered a job there.
What kind of job are yougonna get in Seattle... that youcan' t get in New York?
A friend of mine from junior college called.
- Who?
- Kenneth.
Your ex- man Ken?
He' s managing a company out there, and he offered.
So, you' re leaving me and going back to Ken.
No.
- Are youleaving me?
- Sort of, but it' s not --...
So, you' re leaving me and going back to Kenneth?
- That' s what I asked you.
- The Ken part is just business.
And what' s the leaving me part?
Pleasure?
Pain.
Your sister put youup to this.
She never liked me.
- I know it' s been three years.
We' re in the same situation that we were in when we met.
Meaning, we' re not married.
We' re not married, we can' t afford to get married.
And it doesn' t look like it' s ever gonna change.
Youknow, poor people do get married.
I know, but I don' t feel like fighting with you... every day because we' re broke.
Marriage is hard enough without being poor.
Hey, what happened to the love?
What happened to all that romance?
Youknow I love you.
But youare living in this fantasy.
It' s like you' re waiting for some kind of miracle.
I gotta live in reality.
I am not gonna be young forever.
So yougotta put yourself back on the market... while the merchandise is still fresh.
Youact like there' s a damn expiration date... on your forehead!
I' m sorry.
Youthink I like living like this?
Movin 'tickets, hustlin' chess, DJing at these little clubs?
I should' ve stayed in college.
I messed up.
I messed up.
I' il go back to college.
I love you, Jake.
I love you, too.
But l --...
So, when are youleaving?
Couple weeks.
But l -- We' il talk before then.
Why?
Jake.
- What' s up, man?
- Hey, what' s up?
- What' s wrong?
- Julie left me.
Sorry.
I gotta go.
But I' il catch youtomorrow.
Hey, youget your shit together... or I' m gonna have to fire your ass!
That' s right!
Julie, I' m sorry.
Oh, I' m sorry.
Big- time Tickets.
Yeah, for what game?
How much youwant to spend?
Yeah, I can get it.
So. wlhenre youat?
Wlhenre tlhe lhell' s tlhat?
Thank youvery much.
Whatever.
- Hop out.
- Hey, what' s up?
- Give me your phone.
- What' s up?
Come on, now!
What y' all want?
- Hey, come on!
Youknow how hard it was for me to get a cab to come up here?
I hope y' all givin 'me a ride back.
I know you' re cops, man.
What do youwant, money?
Oh, I understand.
Y' all shot somebody, and now y' all need a suspect.
Mr. Hayes?
Jacob Hayes?
I' m Officer Oakes, that' s Officer Seale...
Officer Swanson, Officer Carew.
What' s that for?
"Crackers In my Ass?"
You' re gonna arrest me for scalpin 'tickets?
We just want to talk to you about something.
- About what?
- About your brother.
Yougot the wrong guy.
I don' t even have a brother.
That' s just a picture of me in a suit.
Youcould' ve got that off the internet.
I saw a picture of Bill Gates with three titties on the net.
OK, September 8, 1970...
Bellevue Hospital, New York City... a woman registered as Mary Jeffries... gives birth to identical twins... but suffers complications and dies the next day.
- What about the father?
- Thomas B. Jeffries.
Presumed alive.
Whereabouts unknown.
The state rarely separates twins... but one of the infants -- Jacob -- that' s you --... was diagnosed with severe lung infection.
Youstill have the scar from the chest tube... the incision mark.
An administrator at the hospital altered the birth record... to give the healthy child a better chance at adoption.
A week later, Roger and Glenda Pope... took in Kevin Jeffries.
The Popes never knew.
Kevin never knew.
So, I have a twin brother.
Big deal.
What' s the ClA have to do with this?
He couldn' t send me a letter?
Your brother' s dead.
How?
A helicopter crash.
We need your help, Mr. Hayes.
Your brother was working on something with us.
My twin brother was ClA?
Yeah, a clandestine operative.
And just before he was killed, he set up a deal.
What kind of deal?
A very important one.
So, we need youto stand in for him, just briefly.
- Pretend I' m him?
- Yeah.
- For how long?
- Nine days.
Nine days is not standin 'in.
Standin 'in is an hour.
Nine days is goin 'on tour.
- ls this shit dangerous?
- There' s some risk.
What kind of risk?
We talkin 'bad credit risk... or a bullet in the ass risk?
- You' d be well compensated.
- For a bullet in the ass risk?
I hope that' s a lot of compensation.
How much?
Throw out a number.
- A billion dollars.
- You' ve overshot.
I don' t know what kind of budget you' re working with.
let' s say... $25, 000.
Fifty.
Yeah, fifty.
I figure youstarted with 25, so I know yougot more.
Youain' t gonna give me all your money.
50, 000.
This is what I' m thinking, Mr. Hayes.
With $25, 000, your girlfriend Julie could go to college.
She wouldn' t have to go to Seattle.
Or work with Ken.
OK, here' s what I' m thinkin '.
You' re gonna give me $50, 000 tax- free.
OK, 50, 000 after taxes after the job is done.
Half now, half after.
Ten now, forty after.
Unless my mother had triplets... you' re gonna give me ten now, ninety after.
OK, yougot a deal.
- So, when do we start?
- Now.
Study it.
Study it.
So there' s homework.
- Preparation.
- OK.
Let' s see, Dad sits on the board of the New York Stock Exchange.
Mom, co- artistic director... at Lincoln Center.
Must' ve been nice.
In my foster house, we were so poor... we used to lick stamps for dinner.
Prep school at Exeter.
Then college at Dartmouth.
Served in the Naval Academy.
- That' s right.
- What' d he serve, lunch?
Oh, man.
"Rhoades scholar."
- So my brother was real smart?
- Yeah.
Damn, the ClA is cheap.
Y' all could' ve got me a queen size.
What' s this, jack size?
Hey, what' s "Záchod" mean?
It' s Czech for "bathroom."
You' il find the room labelled with phonetic translations.
Why?
Because the deal goes down in the Czech Republic.
- Czech Republic?
- Here' s a dictionary.
How do I get an outside line?
I need somebody to feed my cat.
Youdon' t have an outside line or a cat.
So what am I supposed to be doing here?
There' s a tape in the VCR.
It' s a video of your brother.
Watch it.
The way he talks and the way he moves.
I know there' s a lot to deal with here... but we' re all behind you.
We' il start in the morning.
Yougot any questions?
Yeah, if my brother was such a genius... then how come he' s dead?
- 5 A. M. - Hey, I don' t do 5 A. M.
So, bottom line, what are our chances?
I' d say anywhere between nil and zero.
Why do yousay that?
I grant you, he' s got potential.
He' s pretty street- smart.
In 6 months, he could probably fool his brother' s parents.
But eight days?
Yougotta be kidding.
Probably get himself killed on this mission... and anyone else who goes along with him.
Would youlike to be replaced on the mission?
Why?
You' re going ahead with or without me?
That' s precisely what I' m saying.
Well, sir, when do I tell him what this mission involves?
If I were you, I would tell him as little as possible.
Don' t put anything into his head he can' t use... and certainly nothing that could pop out at the wrong time.
- OK.
- What' s he doing now?
SWANSON:
We told him to learn... a few key phrases in Czech.
He seems dedicated.
What' s he saying?
He said, "I haven' t had my period in three months."
Now what?
"Where' s the hospital?
I have a vaginal infection. "
This is gonna be really interesting.
Can' t wait to get started.
Rise and shine, Mr. Hayes!
5 A. M., and all is well.
How about three more hours of sleep and some breakfast?
How about a nice shower?
Aah!
Aah!
Hey!
What' s wrong with you?!
Good morning.
Today we' il be covering basic operations protocol... for the acquisition of foreign assets... a procedure we like to call "The Three I' s" --... identifying the target, initiating the contact... and infiltrating the network...
Now youdo it like him.
Man, this is buggin 'me out.
lookin 'at old album covers.
Look at this guy.
He looks like me, but it' s not me.
- Yeah.
- So, what did he like to do?
What kind of sports was he into?
What kind of music did he listen to?
He liked music.
Jazz and classical.
- Classical, like Run- DMC?
- He didn' t like rap.
What 29- year- old brother don' t like a little bit of rap?
He didn' t listen to rap.
So, what kind of sports was he into?
Skiing.
OK, so yougot skiing, the Navy, no rap.
We' d have had a lot in common.
- Sir.
- Hmm?
What time?
All right.
Thanks.
So, what' s up with youand Swanson?
- Hmm?
- Aw, come on, man.
I see there' s something goin 'on there.
Yougot a little something goin 'on....
Look at you.
You' re blushing.
Do youmind if I say something to you, Mr. Hayes?
My friends, Officer Seale, Officer Swanson... they have faith in you.
I don' t.
And that creates a problem... because you' re in so deep with us now... we can never let yougo.
So you' d better learn this stuff... stone- cold by 0500 hours tomorrow morning.
Or what?
I' il kill you.
Can we start a few hours later tomorrow?
Get dressed.
It' s 4: 59!
Swirl.
Checking for sediment.
Sniff...
And taste.
Morning, Mr. Hayes.
No, 5: 01.
Pope.
Kevin Pope.
Look at this suit.
Man, I got initials on my cuffs.
The only thing I ever have on my cuffs is steak sauce.
They say "M. T."
What' s that for?
Michael Turner.
But I thought I was Kevin Pope.
Kevin Pope is Michael Turner.
Michael Turner is Kevin Pope' s cover identity.
He is a very successful, very knowledgeable... very sophisticated international dealer... in fine antiquities.
Well, if I' m Jake Hayes playing Kevin Pope... playing Michael Turner, then I should get two checks.
Cheers.
This is a very rare expensive cognac.
What do youthink?
Dry.
But never precocious.
I love your shirt.
Egyptian broadcloth?
Three days.
Pretty impressive.
Yeah, he' s bright.
- I think he can do it.
- He' s got my vote.
I said he was bright.
I didn' t say he was capable of saving the world.
- Let' s run a real test.
- Like what?
Send him up to New York.
Put him in Kevin' s apartment.
Let the neighbors, the doorman, everybody get a look at him.
See if they buy him as Michael Turner.
Might even serve a double purpose.
Whoever tried to kill Kevin as Michael Turner... probably doesn' t know he' s dead.
Might still be looking for him.
So we dangle him as bait, keep him in the dark.
- He' il be protected.
- What do we tell him?
You' re giving him a chance to practice being Kevin.
That' s all youneed to tell him.
You' re the boss.
Yousee the van in front of us?
The one behind us?
Those are our guys.
Here' s my cell phone number.
Use it if youget into any kind of trouble.
- What kind of trouble?
- Any kind.
Shark attack?
Call you.
All right.
Could youpop the trunk?
Take this.
Get yourself some shoes.
Little punk.
Mr. Turner, welcome back, sir.
Thanks, Jim.
How was Europe?
Like another country.
Youcould put this on MTV Cnribs.
Man, this is dope!
God damn.
So if I paid taxes... this is where the money would go, huh?
Could have a Puffy party in here.
Let' s get some music in here.
What' s that music?
- It' s terrible.
Jake, it' s your downstairs neighbor...
[Doorbell rings]
Don' t forget the radio.
OK.
Hi, Michael!
Welcome back.
- Vera, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.
Hi, Annabella.
We just came in and the doorman said youwere back.
- Annabella missed you.
I' ve been waiting desperately for youto come back.
Why?
- I bought a little treasure.
Come on down and tell me if I got a good buy.
- Oh, OK.
- Hold your baby.
- Yes, my baby.
- How was your trip?
This is gonna be a disaster.
Go see your nanny, baby.
What do youthink?
Is it a good piece?
- It' s exquisite.
Do youthink?
Go ahead, pick it up.
Feel it.
Just see how delicate it is.
Pick it up, right?
Yes.
Just grab it and pick it up.
Michael... that' s what we keep the doggy treats in.
Of course, I knew that.
I was just getting it... out of the way so I could see the --...
- The vase.
- Of course, the vase!
Yes!
May I ask, how much did youpay for this?
150, 000.
Good lord!
What yougonna put in it, cocaine?!
He fooled the doorman, he fooled the neighbor... and the neighbor' s dog.
What more do youwant?
Oakes, we need to know who' s after that bomb.
You' re willing to sacrifice him to find out?
Don' t be dramatic.
He' s got plenty of protection.
I' il tell youwhen to pull him.
Hope y' all not watching this.
I don' t have to watch this, do I, sir?
- Oh, no.
- Code red.
Code red.
Code red!
Code red!
Parish, McCain, cover the exits!
Help!
Help!
Help!
God.
Sir, he' s headed for the roof.
- We need him alive.
- Yes, sir.
Drop the knife.
Hey, Elvis, if youdrop the knife and step down... no one is gonna hurt you.
So... who' s got Jake?
Well, these last ten minutes will be used... as a teaching aid on how an operation can get totally --...
- Screwed up, sir?
- Thank you.
We' il find him, sir.
[Beep]
Where are you?
Bye!
I' il call youback!
I' m stuck in traffic.
I ask youto do --...
Give me that!
Yo!
Run fingerprints, DNA, anything we can get... on the guy who jumped off the roof.
- Yes, sir.
- He looks Afghani, sir.
Don' t assume anything.
[Ring]
- Yes, sir.
- Jake --...
And they' re gonna murder me!
- Let' s meet some place -- - No more bullshit!
We lost him because we lied to him.
No, youlost him because youlost him.
We treated him like an idiot.
He had a right to know what we were doing with him.
We' re wasting time!
Find him and bring him back... and spare me your conscience.
Spare my conscience.
- Take it easy, buddy.
- Bye. "It' s called clhillin '"...
Yeah?
Hello?
Pam, it' s Jake.
Can I talk to Julie?
- She don' t want to talk to you.
- Who' s on the phone?
I need to talk to Julie.
Please.
This is serious.
It is Jake?
Wait, let me talk to him!
- She' s moving on.
- Give me the phone.
We don' t need no more trouble, Jake... and youain' t nothing but trouble.
Two suits came around today looking for you.
Give me the phone!
Hey, hey, hey.
Shit, your phone' s tapped.
If Julie' s there, tell her I love her... and, Oakes, if you' re listening, kiss my ass!
- Youget a trace?
- No.
He hung up.
Mr. Hayes, where are you?
Where in the hell are you?.
Ma.
- Help!
Help!
- Ma!
- Ma!
Ma!
- Somebody help!
It' s me!
Ma, it' s me!
Jakey?
Yeah, yeah.
Yougonna break my arm.
Well, what are youdoing in the dark?
Some people are looking for me.
- What did youdo?
- I didn' t do nothin '!
It' s not what youthink.
It' s not the police.
It' s way too hard to explain.
Look at this.
Eight foster kids I' ve taken into my house over the years... and all of them made something of themselves... and not one of them had your potential!
Oh, come on, Ma!
Sellin ', scramblin' and hustlin '.
Ma, did youknow I had a brother?
Stop talking crazy.
Youhad lots of brothers.
How' s that nice girl I met last Christmas?
She left me.
Hand me that umbrella so I can hit youagain.
Youknow, Ma, maybe it wasn' t my fault?
- Youneed money?
- No.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I need money.
How much do youneed?
I won $250 at bingo.
It' s just for a little while.
I' il pay youback.
[Chuckles]
Want something to eat?
Youknow what?
I really gotta go.
I' m never giving up on you, Jakey.
You' re going to do something to make me very proud one day.
[Chuckles]
I owe youan apology.
Youhear me?
I was just wondering how many of your people are listening in.
We' re alone.
No cameras, no wires.
Just me.
Yougot the floor.
Your brother was assassinated.
By the same guys who came after me, right?
I guess so.
Doing the same job as you.
Which is what?
Your brother, as Michael Turner... was helping me buy something off the black market.
What?
Cuban cigars?
PlayStation 3?
What?
I can' t tell youif you' re not coming back in with us.
I' m not comin 'back in if youain' t telling me.
Your brother died saving my life.
Did youknow that?
Wish it had been otherwise, but that' s the way it is.
How are his parents taking it?
Youdidn' t tell his parents?
No.
That' s the way we want it.
How would youfeel if youdied and nobody told your wife?
I' m not married.
- There' s no Mrs. Spy?
- Not anymore.
Relationships and attachments are useless in this business.
So that' s how this job is.
Even if they don' t shoot you, they take your life....
I know it sounds hokey, but I honestly believe... our lives are about something bigger than ourselves... and I' m offering youa chance to commit yourself to something.
Youain' t offering me nothin '... but a chance at a bullet in my ass.
I don' t see the higher meaning in that.
Tell youwhat I' m gonna do.
- Thank you.
- No problem.
I' il tell the agency I couldn' t find you.
We can' t pull this job off without you.
We need you.
Think about it.
Oh, well.
That didn' t work, did it?
No.
"I' m gonna go outside and count to ten"?
Who the hell are you?
You' d have done better with "Bitch, get in the car."
OK.
Get in the car... bitch.
This is the man who tried to kill you.
We now know that he' s a member of a multi- national... terrorist organization led by this man.
Meet the man who killed your brother --...
Dragan Adjanic.
He' s wanted by The Hague for terrorist crimes... against humanity, so he' s a fugitive... everywhere in the world, including his own country.
He calls his movement "The Black Hand."
His members take a death pledge... becoming suicide soldiers to further their cause.
Last year, the FBI caught four of his men... in a Washington, D. C. motel... with enough urea nitrate to level the Capitol building.
He doesn' t like America and he doesn' t like you.
- Wait a minute.
- He' s your rival buyer.
For the item that this man has to sell.
Now, this is Adrik Vas.
He' s a Russian ex- army colonel, kingpin in the Russian mafia.
Up to his neck in prostitution, drugs, and extortion.
Sounds like anybody I went to high school with.
This is Vas' s right- hand man.
His name is Michelle Petrov... otherwise known as "The Hammer."
Remember these faces... because you' re going to be seeing them soon.
Why do they call this guy The Hammer?
Wha -- what?!
Good evening.
Isn' t this fun?
This is an exercise known as King' s Game.
It' s meant to test your awareness.
What can youtell me about your attackers?
They woke me up.
Look, man, if youwant me to spy...
- I' m gonna need my rest.
- How many were there?
Didn' t I just say they woke me up?!
That' s the weird thing about an ambush.
Next time we' il try and warn you.
Do youunderstand what happened to youjust now?
I was jacked!
- No, youpanicked.
When youthought youwere in danger, your brain shut down.
So what' s the point of having a good brain... if youcan' t keep it operating?
My brain didn' t shut down.
'cause I could feel her tits on my back.
I knew it was Carew 'cause his breath smelled like shit.
Probably from kissing your ass so much.
I knew it was Seale because I took his wallet.
Hey, Seale, why' s a married man need a condom?
Your wife know?
Youwant to know how I knew it was you?
OK, thank you.
Game' s over.
Good night.
Oh, where yougoing?
Yougonna leave like that?
Come back!
Y' all got me up!
Let' s do something!
Let' s hit a club or something.
Based on our intelligence projections... and the text manual provided by Agent Pope... this is a mock- up of what you' il be buying.
Does it play DVDs?
It' s a portable thermonuclear weapon.
- So that' s a bomb?
- It' s a reproduction.
Last year, a Russian suitcase bomb... was stolen from a dismantling facility in the Ural mountains.
Your brother tracked it down, we need youto recover it.
Two things you' re gonna have to do --...
Would one of them be shittin 'in my pants?
Welcome to Prague.
Looks like Newark.
Welcome back to the hotel, Mr. Turner.
Thank you.
Mr. Turner.
So glad to have youback, sir.
Thank you, Lempenka.
Hope youhaven' t given out my room.
Certainly not, sir.
This is beautiful.
Her name is Lenka.
Youjust called her "Lempenka," which means "cardboard."
Man, it' s gonna be hard to go back to Jersey.
We' il be in the suite across the hall... with full video and audio surveillance of this room.
All right, now, when I go to the bathroom... press the pause button.
Just stay in the room.
You' ve got nothing to worry about.
Except for my little date with a nuclear bomb.
OK, this is our lifeline.
Our only link to Adrik Vas.
Nothing happens till he calls.
Don' t let it out of your sight.
And remember, from now on, there' s no Jake... there' s no Kevin, only Michael Turner.
Well...
I think I' m gonna like being Michael Turner.
Think maybe youwant to take a look at this.
OK, what the hell' s he up to now?
Fish egg?
It' s 12, 000 crowns an ounce.
Party' s over.
Naw, the party just started.
I' m gonna have my ass buffed.
Hey!
This little piggy go to market...
Make sure youput my initials on the big toe.
People need to know whose feet this is.
That' s Vas.
Where' s the cell phone?
Phone, phone, phone.
Thank you.
Hello?
Yeah, we' il be there.
It' s Vas.
The deal' s on in an hour.
Now your eye.
Look right into the computer screen.
Blink for confirmation.
OK, that' s it.
All right.
From this point on... only youwill be able to access your computer.
Mnr.
We have visual.
You' il do fine.
Everyone' s nervous the first day of school.
I always cut the first day of school.
Don' t worry.
You' re covered from every angle.
I can' t wait to meet "The Hammer."
Oh, these guys must be "The Toolbox."
Should we move in, sir?
No.
Not until we' re sure they brought the bomb.
There' s too much at stake.
Nice coat.
Gentlemen, are we going to do business or aren' t we?
Depends, Michael.
Where have youbeen for the last nine days?
I don' t believe that concerns you.
On the contrary.
It concerns me very much.
We make a deal, youdisappear.
Doesn' t look good, my friend.
Heads up, McCain.
Be advised, targets are armed.
Maintain your positions.
Everyone maintain your position.
Copy that, sir.
Do we have a problem?
I don' t know.
Youtell me.
Do we have a problem?
Do we?
Give me the cell phone I gave youearlier.
Don' t worry.
I only made collect calls.
Look, I don' t know what this is about, but --...
No, youdon' t, so shut up.
Neither does Mr. Turner.
Yousee, this cell phone has a global positioning system.
In a moment, it' il tell me exactly where you' ve been... the last nine days.
Fantastic, eh?
Well, haven' t youbeen busy?
Oh, youget around.
Heh.
And not one decent treasure to show for it.
Now, where' s the money?
Where' s the product?
Nearby.
So, how do we do this?
I' m gonna call you on this cell phone... then youhave one hour to get the money, Michael.
Then I' il call youagain and tell you... where to bring it to.
Youunderstand?
I' m gonna have to run some tests... so make sure youbring authentic merchandise.
Fair enough.
Ha!
Are we agreed?
Yes.
OAKES:
We' re not bringing money anywhere.
No?
I' il have someone transfer the remaining 19 million... when Mr. Turner tells us we have a viable device.
It' il be done by computer.
One of my men will be standing by at this address.
Youwill send one of your brain trusts... to verify the money is in your account, and that' s it.
Give youa hostage?
And youget one.
We' il call it a security deposit... which neither of us will get back if we screw up... or if we leave a mess.
It' s that simple.
Now we have an agreement, I think.
Agreed.
Don' t yougo disappearing on me again, Michael.
Hey, youdid real well, Mr. Hayes.
Hey, youdid real well, Mr. Hayes.
Youknew they wouldn' t bring it, right?
Standard procedure.
Guys like him won' t risk... getting screwed on the first date.
What if youhadn' t changed the chip in the phone?
It would have told him that the phone had already... traveled to ClA headquarters in Langley... and they would have shot both of us in the heads.
- I' m hungry.
How about you?
- I' m gonna pass.
Then good night.
Michael!
Hi.
This place comes with everything, huh?
Could youget me a towel?
Ahem.
I knew you' d be surprised.
I didn' t think you' d be shocked.
Youwant some room service?
No.
I' d like a good stiff drink.
- Oh, shit.
It' s Nicole.
- What?
This isn' t exactly the welcome I expected.
Wassup?
Honey, I made dinner reservations...
- at our favorite place.
- I love that place.
Honey, aren' t youhappy to see me?
- Yeah.
- Good.
I gotta get that.
I' il be right back.
How are youdoing?
- Yousee how I' m doing.
- Yeah.
We have a problem.
Where I' m from, people pay a lot of money... for problems like that.
That' s Nicole.
That' s Michael' s girlfriend.
She works for CNN in Europe.
So how come didn' t youtell me Michael had a girlfriend?
Well, they broke up several weeks ago.
They had a fight, and she walked out.
Well, it looks like she forgave him.
What the hell did he fight with her fine ass for?
Well, apparently he had intimacy problems.
He was distant, some kind of psychotherapy crap.
Anyway, she went off to cover the Balkans.
OK, so what do you want me to do?
Take her to dinner.
She' s CNN.
If youhandle this badly, she could blow your cover.
- OK.
- Good.... Cheat.
Just... don' t cheat... just... don' t cheat... just... don' t cheat... just say...
That was Jehovah' s Witnesses!
- Just...
- Michael...
I hope you' re hungry, baby.
Hey!
Julie. and tlhe kids.
Julie, it' s Jake.
Are youthere?
OK, if youhaven' t left yet, please wait for me.
Please, please.
I got a new job.
It' s totally legit.
And I' ve changed.
I' ve totally changed.
I' m a new man.
I' m the man who loves you.
I love you.
I love youso much.
I didn' t even know how much I loved youtill 2 minutes ago.
It' s Jake.
- Julie!
- I love him!
No, youdon' t!
Honey, what' s taking you so long?
Big sacrifices.
Please wait for me.
Please wait for me.
Jake, I heard you.
I heard every word, baby.
I' m not going anywhere.
I' il be right here.
[Beep]
Jake?
Jake?
Hello!
Jake!
Thank you.
So are yougonna make me grovel?
No, not unless youwant to.
Is this fish?
Yeah, of course.
Youlove fish.
That' s right.
I love fish... but that' s before I became a vegetarian.
Oh, waiter, waiter!
I can' t eat this.
Can youget me something else?
How about a steak, medium well, please.
- Ah, thanks a lot.
I thought youwere a vegetarian.
Vegetarian?
I' il eat a pig' s ass if they cook it right.
But enough about me.
How about those Balkans?
I missed you, Michael.
I' m sorry I left.
What' s the matter?
There' s somebody else.
There is?
When did that happen?
- Right after youleft.
- I left youtwo weeks ago.
I mean...
Did youmeet her here in Prague?
No, in Jersey.
New Jersey?
Yeah, I was in New York... and Jersey' s right next to New York... and I just took a little day trip.
Who is she?
What does she do?
She' s a nurse' s aide at Saint Sebastian' s Hospital.
Her name' s Julie.
She' s got curly hair.
I get it.
OK.
I have it comin '.
But I' m willing to work for it.
Ah- ah- ah -- Nicole!
Youhurt me really bad.
And I can' t just let you yo- yo with my heart, OK?
Youhurt me, and I' m never gonna let it happen again!
Love don' t live here anymore!
Michael, I' ve never seen youlike this.
So... open.
So... so in touch with your feelings.
Like youcould really be in love with a nurse from New Jersey.
You' re just much more --... mmm... warm and vulnerable and funny!
Youdidn' t used to be funny before.
That' s funny "ha ha" funny... or funny "this milk tastes funny" funny?
See?
That' s funny!
You' re not Michael Turner.
Charlie!
I wasn' t so sure you' d be on the bus.
Didn' t want your white brothers thinking you were the best we had.
SOLOMON ISLANDS 1943
Watch out!
My hand!
Goddamn!
We' re running out of ammo.
We gotta get out of here.
Come on!
Come on!
We got nothin ', Enders!
We' re out of ammo!
Nobody else needs to die.
We can go!
We can get outta here!
We got orders!
They told us to hold the position!
And that' s what we' re gonna do!
Get up, marine!
Hold the goddamn position!
Get down!
Tommy.
Goddamn you!
Oh, no!
No!
- Bill!
- I' m out.
Come on!
Goddamn you, Joe Enders.
No!
No!
Raise your right hand.
State your full name...
- I, Ben Yahzee...
CAMP PENDLETON, CALlFORNlA... do solemnly swear to support and defend the constitution of the US...... against all enemies, foreign and domestic...... against all enemies, foreign and domestic...
Jap Ha- Go.
Who can give me the code word for "tank"?
You boys wanna be codetalkers.
Show me some brains.
Think!
What do we call a tank?
Chay- da- gahi.
Tortoise.
Good.
Artillery.
Code word?
In code.
Private Whitehorse.
Be- al- doh- tso- lani?
Very good.
Japanese Zero.
Code word?
KANEOHE BAY US NAVAL HOSPlTAL 1943
We can go!
We can get outta here!
They told us to hold the position!
Nice day, huh?
Joe?
Joe.
Didn' t hear a word, did you?
That' s what happens to a man when he' s talking to a beautiful woman.
It happens when you' re not watching my lips, Joe.
Watch this.
You' re a mess, Joe.
You' re not fooling anybody.
No, Rita.
He' s a mess.
I' m getting better every day.
You got a perforated eardrum, Enders.
Your equilibrium' s all screwy.
You can' t go back to war if you can' t stand up.
Let' s go, marines.
This war ain' t gonna wait forever.
Let' s go.
Joe...
Why don' t you just stay here, Joe?
Somebody' s gotta keep the WAVES company.
Are you gonna help me or not?
Marked improvement.
And his left ear is the worse of the two?
It' s... amazing.
TBYhasn' t got the range of the TBX.
So you may need a relay to get your transmission to command post.
But what it really comes down to is speed and accuracy under pressure.
Transcribe now.
Victor, Victor.
This is X- ray.
Over.
Damn it!
We got a unit under fire!
We' re losing men.
I need this message decrypted.
"Request fire support.
We have target at one- one- niner, Baker one- five. "
"Pillbox with heavy machine gun.
Fire at will. "
Beginner' s luck.
You' re up, mac.
- Corporal Enders reporting, sir.
- At ease.
You' ve done well as a marine, Corporal.
Better than you did as a civilian.
Stole a motorbike, crashed it.
Got kicked out of high school.
Assault and battery... on one Father Crispin O' Donnell?
A priest?
Assistant principal at Archbishop Keenan High School, sir, and head disciplinarian.
Public- school boy myself.
Some minor problems in boot.
A commendation for valor in Shanghai.
And you made a hell of a stand on the Solomons.
Tough bit of business there, huh?
Pretty tough, sir.
But you' re prepared to jump right back into it?
Yes, sir.
Very much so.
Very much so.
Well...
The Japs have pretty much busted every code we' ve thrown at 'em, Corporal.
You men on the Solomons were lost to a broken code.
Tell me something.
You ever run into any Indians on the Solomons?
- Indians, sir?
- Navajo, to be exact.
The Corps has developed a new code based on their language.
It' s had quite an impact.
So much so the navy have decided to go to great lengths to protect it.
That' s why you' re here.
You' re to pair with one of them, keep his ass safe.
Your job is to keep him alive so he can do his job.
Begging the major' s pardon, but I believe I' d best serve the Corps killing Japs, not baby- sitting some Indian.
Enders, we didn' t pick your name out of a hat.
We need good marines.
That' s why you' re standing here.
Take a look.
It' s a Navajo.
Or it was.
Tortured to death by Japanese intelligence trying to bust our code.
Fortunately, he couldn' t help them even if he wanted to.
- Sir?
- Man' s a Navajo, not a codetalker.
Code' s based on their language, but it is still a code.
Tojo would like nothing more than to catch a live one.
What I' m about to tell you, Corporal, cannot leave this room.
Under no circumstances can you allow your codetalker to fall into enemy hands.
Your mission is to protect the code... at all costs.
You understand me?
Yes, sir, I do.
Good.
Congratulations.
You just made sergeant.
Keep those hands vertical.
Way to go, marine.
Fortino, take over.
That was you, right, sitting in front of the major' s office?
Yeah.
Listen, I' m Pete Henderson.
They call me Ox.
Not cos of my big muscles or anything.
I' m from Oxnard, California.
Just north of Hollywood a ways.
So you' re with JASCO too, huh?
Hey, know where we might find 2nd Joint Assault Signal?
Hey, know where we might find 2nd Joint Assault Signal?
No fuckin 'idea, mac.
Thanks.
Thanks a bunch.
I' ve never seen so many white men.
They' ve never seen so many Navajo.
Looks to me like you got to see a little action there.
Me too.
Jap sons of bitches shot me right in the ass.
You believe that shit?
I wasn' t running or nothin '.
So, your duty with JASCO have anything to do with these Navajo radiomen?
I' m not at liberty to say.
I see you got a new stripe there.
Me too.
So I' m guessing the orders you can' t tell me are the same orders I can' t tell you.
Hell of a thing, huh?
Ain' t a democracy, Sergeant.
It' s the marines.
Yeah.
They look pretty normal, I guess.
Expecting them to wear war paint?
Maybe we ought to go introduce ourselves.
They look a little lost to me.
Henderson.
I wouldn' t get too friendly.
How!
Just kiddin '.
I' m Ox.
Whitehorse.
This is Yahzee.
Ben.
- Next.
- Beautiful.
Beautiful.
Close your eyes.
It' il taste better.
Who' s next?
Mind if I join you?
I' m Ben Yahzee.
Guess the Corps paired us up.
How you doin '?
You' re blocking my view.
Oh, sorry.
What do they call this crap anyway?
Marines call it chow.
Well, there' s a propaganda effort.
Sorry.
You can have mine.
Shit.
What' d you say your name was again, Private?
It' s Yahzee.
Ben Yahzee.
Hold this.
Shit.
How' s your white man?
Hungry.
I' m in for a couple more.
You writing to your son?
Tell him I say hello.
Pair of cowboys for Big E.
- Possible straight for the Greek.
- Possible thumb up the Greek' s ass.
Oh, a pair of twos for the kid.
Lookin 'good.
- Oh, come on!
- Now there' s a bold move.
All right.
Oh, another mess for the Sunshine State.
- What, are you mad at me?
- Just want your money.
Hey!
Look at that.
A trio of nines.
Pretty.
- You shuffle that deck?
- I certainly did.
Nines bets.
I' il raise it two bits.
Call.
We all got thumbs up our asses.
You won' t for much longer.
I got a buddy in Intel that says we ship out in a week.
I been hearing "next week" for a month.
I didn' t know you knew anybody in Intelligence, Harri.
Next year' d be all right with me.
Look at that.
Nines and fours.
Full boat, baby.
Cowboys over queens.
Read 'em and die.
Ouch.
- Fuck it.
- Yeah.
I' m gonna go write the missus.
God knows what a girl will do without reassurance.
Son of a bitch.
Hey, looks like we got a coupla seats opening up.
You wanna come join us?
Are you serious?
What, Injun poker?
Hey, how do you boys do that again?
Card on the head, only fool can' t see it is you.
You want to come on over, or what?
Cut me in.
I' m thinkin 'Fiery Cross, high- low, hoggers OK, ace plays both ways...
I' m thinkin 'Fiery Cross, high- low, hoggers OK, ace plays both ways...
Hey, don' t let him scare you.
If you' ve ever played a high- low game, it' s like any other.
Waste of time and money.
Chief.
How' d you know I was a chief?
You must' ve seen me showering with my war bonnet.
- Deal 'em up, deal' em up.
- You know, we don' t take wampum here.
Beautiful.
All right, then.
Orders finally came through.
We ship out tomorrow morning.
Destination: the island of Saipan, which is one of the stepping stones we gotta take on our road show to Tokyo.
It' s of strategic importance that we capture this island.
We can get ourselves an advanced naval base and an airstrip to land and refuel B- 29' s and get our bombers within range of Tokyo.
Now, Saipan is Japanese soil, and there' s 30, 000 of 'em dug in.
They' re gonna fight for every square inch, because it' s their home, but we' re gonna take it away from 'em!
Yeah!
Kill me some Japs!
We' re gonna be in front of the whole damn division.
We' re gonna be the eyes and the ears.
We' re gonna be sniffin 'out enemy positions, coordinating the naval gunfire - exactly what we' ve been training to do for the last four months.
All right?
Now, we got some new radiomen from headquarters.
There' s a Private Whitehorse...
and Yahzee... and a couple of sergeants, Enders and Henderson, who, if I' m understanding these orders correctly, will be covering our Navajos' asses.
Goddamn you, Joe Enders!
... but I' m tellin 'you, we' il be steppin' into our share of the shit nonetheless.
Any questions?
Sounds like you' re dying.
These might help get rid of the taste.
Charlie and I, we both lost it on the boat ride from San Diego.
Not many bodies of water in Arizona.
Life Savers really helped.
You want a Life Saver?
What are you doin 'here?
Just trying to help.
Not what I meant.
You mean what am I doing in this uniform?
It' s my war too, Sergeant.
I' m fighting for my country, for my land, for my people.
Not your people I' m worried about.
Listen, Enders, I' m a codetalker.
It takes me two- and- a- half minutes to do what used to take an hour.
Now, somebody wearing a lot more stripes than you thinks that' s worth something.
Remind me to time you when you got bullets flying over your head.
What the hell' s wrong with you?
Shave his belly with a rusty razor
Shave his belly with a rusty razor Early in the morning!
From the halls of Montezuma
To the shores of Tripoli
We will fight our country' s battles
On the land and on the sea
And to keep our honor clean
We are proud to claim the title
Of United States Marines
Hi.
How' s that ear?
Not that you' d ever admit it, but if it starts aching, take a couple of those.
And call me in the morning.
You' re not gonna be here in the morning, are you?
Shipping out without even buying me a drink.
Ought to be ashamed of yourself, hustling a... hustling marines.
What' s your poison?
Jeez, might as well go all out.
I' il get a shot of something.
Rum.
Eddie, give me a shot of Bacardi.
Make that two.
May as well join me, huh?
- Why not?
- OK.
Thank you.
Well... to war.
THE JAPANESE ISLAND OF SAlPAN JUNE 16, 1944
Let' s go, let' s go, let' s go!
Get those men spread out!
Charlie, come on, come on, come on!
Come on, keep up!
Let' s go, let' s go, let' s go!

Go!
Get him outta there!
Get me outta here!

You sons of bitches!
Fortino!
Cover me!
Whitehorse, get down!
Get down!
Pappas!
Corpsman!
Helmet goes on your head!
Corpsman!
Take care of him.
Put a hand on this.
Tank!
Tank!
Tank!
You ready?
Go!
Harrigan, light it up!
Let' s go, boys!
Keep up the fight!
Are you hit?
Are you hit?
You' re OK.
You' re good, you' re good.
- Are you OK, Chick?
- Still in the hunt, Gunny.
- Harri?
- You ain' t gettin 'rid of me that easy.
- Stay low!
- Nellie?
Pappas?
Yeah, we' re good.
Greek' s predisposed to hyperventilate.
What?
I can' t breathe when I get excited.
Goddamn!
Must be hell on your gal!
Enders, get the navy on the horn and tell 'em to dig out those guns.
Target reference... dog one... right 700.
Elevation zero- five- zero.
Relay the damn coordinates!
Arizona!
Arizona!
USS CALlFORNlA
It sounds like they' re underwater.
Is it English?
Target reference, dog one, south 700, elevation zero- five- zero.
Up 50.
Fire for effect.
Let' s go!
Move!
Harrigan!
Torch the box!
Kill him!
Goddamn it!
Shit.
Nellie.
Take the satchel charge.
You hear me?
Move!
You' re gonna cover me, right?
I' il go with you.
We flank left.
I' il cover you.
Smoke and cover.
I can do this.
I can do this.
Smoke 'em up!
Cover up.
Shit!
Shit.
Goddamn Nipponese touchdown!
Heads up around 0500.
You' re going to have replacements and ammo coming up.
Over.
Roger.
Make sure they have the new password.
"Wind." Answer:
"Talkers."
That' s what one of our Navajo brothers calls us.
What do you think?
Over.
"Windtalkers," I like it.
OK, Kemo Sabe, keep your butts down tonight.
Over.
Biscuits?
How can you ruin biscuits?
You are a whiny son of a bitch right now, aren' t you?
2200 hours in jungle hell - what does that make it on the East Coast?
How the fucking hell should I know?
Just seven...
It' s 8am, Sunday morning.
I hope my side of the bed didn' t get taken up Saturday night.
Nell, you' il give yourself an ulcer, you keep worrying about her.
Might get my ass sent back to Rhody, though.
There' s plenty of dollies outside of Rhode Island, Nell.
Many plenty.
- Well, there sure as shit ain' t any here.
- Ain' t that the truth.
That' s cos they' re all in Daytona Beach.
The most beautiful women in the world.
I' m lyin 'on the beach and this sweet little thing named Molly comes out the water.
She walks straight up to me and asks me if I' m hungry... cos she' s havin 'a weenie roast.
Shit!
Damn.
Yeah, me and Molly, oh boy.
Now I' m on Saipan with this giant Zippo strapped to my back and I' m roastin 'human beings.
Why I volunteered... beyond me.
Damn, I' m proud to be here.
My whole family' s been in the Corps.
My old man, he' s a lifer.
An ass- kicker on the land and on the sea.
Around the house too.
Maybe now he' il back off.
Pappas, I...
I want you to do me a favor.
If anything should happen to me, you make sure that my wife gets this.
I mean, she picked them out and all.
Don' t talk like that, Nell.
You don' t even joke about shit like that.
Now you put that ring back on.
You' re goin 'home.
Hey.
Don' t thank me till you' ve tried it.
You missed mail call.
What the hell are they doin '?
I don' t know.
They' ve been doin 'it since sundown.
Sounds like some kind of prayer.
Maybe they know our orders.
Think you could do it, Joe?
Give it a rest, Henderson.
Give it a rest?
I keep tryin ', but...
I' m here to kill Japs, not marines.
I saw you a warrior, Yahzee...
You will make your family proud.
What the hell you think you' re doin ', boy?
Getting on my uniform.
You know the difference between you and a Jap, Yahzee?
It' s that uniform.
That' s it.
See, I know you people.
I know what kind of slanty- eyed savage you are, boy.
You ought to be careful out here all alone.
No baby- sitter.
I might just take you for a Jap.
You gonna let me get dressed, Chick?
Or keep demonstrating what an ignorant fool you are?
How' s that for an ignorant fool?
Go ahead, try again.
You gonna do somethin '?
Chick!
Come on!
Get off me!
- You OK, Ben?
- Yeah.
Ben?
Shit.
I thought he was a Jap.
You know, killed some marine for that uniform.
Sure you did, Chick.
Damn Injun looks just like a Jap, don' t he?
Look, I' m no damn Injun.
I' m Navajo, of the Bitter Water People, born for the Towering House clan.
But you do look like a Nip.
Next time you decide to take a bath, Private, let me know, or I' il kick your ass.
Fuckin 'shitbird.
Supposed to be with a baby- sitter all the time, I thought.
Out here huntin 'salmon and shit.
That ceremony you saw last night?
It' s called a protection ceremony.
Navajo believe, until a body' s given a proper burial, the spirits stay near it.
Chindis - that' s what we call evil spirits.
Demons.
I haven' t thought much about it since I was a kid.
Till I saw those dead bodies.
You telling me you saw ghosts, Private?
No, Sergeant.
No, Sergeant.
I' m telling you I won' t freeze up again.
Because your buddy smeared ash on your forehead?
That' s right.
Cos my buddy smeared ash on my forehead.
You ever see ghosts?
No more stupid questions today, Private.
That' s an order.
Sounds beautiful.
You, uh, you self- taught?
My dad was always playing.
You know what they say: if you can' t beat 'em...
No shit.
My dad, he... he gave me this thing.
Used to call me the Pied Piper of the Pigs.
Used to bring 'em in for feeding with this little tune I played.
like you just said, if you can' t beat 'em...
I don' t think it' s gonna work.
Well, we ain' t got much else to do out here.
What the hell?
OK.
All right, you lead off.
I' il follow you.
2nd Recon Company will move out at 0600 and scout along road 04.
You can expect light resistance northwest of the palm grove.
Over.
Roger.
What do you mean, light?
No resistance is light!
Over.
Remember, marine, "Ours is not to question why, ours is but to do or die."
Semper Fi.
Over.
Dear Joe, how the hell are you?
Or, given that you' re not much of a writer, should I not expect an answer?
The newspapers say our boys are doing great.
But I don' t think the reporters have been to Kaneohe Bay Hospital.
I found a stray dog the other day on Waikiki.
I gave him a bath and took him in.
He reminded me of you - but cuter.
At least he keeps me warm at night.
I try not to think about you.
About what might be happening over there.
But sometimes, when I' m lying in bed,
I can' t keep myself from wondering where you are.
How you' re doing.
What the hell you doin '?
Writing a letter to my son.
Forget your orders?
No letters out.
Command don' t want postmarks going to the reservation.
Hey!
You hear me?
I thought that he might read 'em when I get home.
What' s his name?
Your son.
It' s George.
George Washington.
George Washington Yahzee.
It' s got a bit of a ring to it.
My wife wasn' t so sure.
She' s a little more traditional.
- Let' s see, Yahz.
Yeah, that George, he' s quite a character.
He' s got a mind of his own.
Can I try one of those?
- You smoke?
- Not really.
- Dismount!
- Get out of the truck!
Let' s go!
- Follow me!
- Let' s go!
- I' m hit!
- Yahzee!
Yahzee!
I' m hit!
Take it off!
It burns!
You' re not hit.
Just shut up.
You' re not hit.
- Spread out!
- Move!
- Where the hell are they comin 'from?
- From us.
- What?
- They' re not Jap guns.
- We' re getting shot at by our own guys?
- We' re supposed to be on road 04.
- Get the regiment on the horn.
- I can' t!
- I can' t!
The radio' s out.
It' s been hit.
- They' re firing too short!
- The Japs gotta be way ahead of us.
Do somethin '.
Shit...
Follow me!
- We' re on the wrong fuckin 'road!
- Goddamn it!
God.
Son of a bitch!
I got you, mac!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Nellie!
Corpsman!
You were right, Joe.
I do look like a Nip.
What the hell are you talking about?
Putting on that Jap uniform.
Trying to get one of their radios, call off our guns.
- That' s stupid.
- Shut up.
Let him talk.
- He' s not goin 'out there.
- You' re not in charge here, Enders.
I got orders, Gunny. He' s my responsibility!
What' s wrong with you?
Senator, we' re making our final approach into Coruscant.
Very good, Lieutenant.
[Man]
There was no danger at all.
Cordé.
I' ve failed you, Senator.
No.
Milady, you' re still in danger here.
- I shouldn' t have come back.
Cordé did hers.
Senator Amidala, please.
I don' t know how much longer I can hold off the vote, my friends.
More and more star systems are joining the separatists.
- If they do break away -- - I will not let this Republic... that has stood for a thousand years be split in two.
My negotiations will not fail.
If they do, you must realize there aren' t enough Jedi to protect the Republic.
We' re keepers of the peace, not soldiers.
Do you think it will really come to war?
Hmm, the dark side clouds everything.
Impossible to see the future is.
- Good.
Send them in.
We will discuss this matter later.
Senator Amidala, your tragedy on the landing platform -- terrible.
Seeing you alive brings warm feelings to my heart.
Do you have any idea who was behind this attack?
Our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners on the moons of Naboo.
I think that Count Dooku was behind it.
He is a political idealist, not a murderer.
You know, milady, Count Dooku was once a Jedi.
He couldn' t assassinate anyone.
But for certain, Senator... in grave danger you are.
Master Jedi, may I suggest... the senator be placed... under the protection of your graces.
Do you really think that' s a wise decision under these stressful times?
Chancellor, if I may comment, I do not believe --
The situation is that serious?
I realize all too well that additional security... might be disruptive for you... but perhaps someone you' re familiar with.
An old friend, like Master Kenobi.
He' s just returned from a border dispute on Ansion.
Please?
The thought of losing you... is unbearable.
I will have Obi- Wan report to you immediately, milady.
You seem a little on edge.
- I haven' t felt you this tense... since we fell into that nest of gundarks.
You fell into that nightmare, Master... and I rescued you, remember?
Oh... yes.
You' re sweating.
Take a deep breath.
I haven' t seen her in ten years, Master.
Obi!
Mesa so smilen to seein yousa!
Mesa palos here!
Desa Jedi arriven.
It' s a great pleasure to see you again, milady.
It has been far too long, Master Kenobi.
Ani?
Grown more beautiful, I mean.
Ani, you' il always be that little boy I knew on Tatooine.
Our presence here will be invisible, milady, I can assure you.
I' m Captain Typho of Her Majesty' s security service.
I am grateful you are here, Master Kenobi.
The situation is more dangerous than the senator will admit.
I don' t need more security.
I want to know who' s trying to kill me.
We are here to protect you, Senator, not to start an investigation.
We will fiind out who' s trying to kill you, Padmé.
- I promise you.
- We will not exceed our mandate... my young Padawan learner.
We will not go through this exercise again, Anakin...
- and you will pay attention to my lead.
What?
Why else do you think we were assigned to her if not to fiind the killer?
Protection is a job for local security, not Jedi.
It' s overkill, Master.
We will do exactly as the council has instructed.
And you will learn your place, young one.
Perhaps with merely your presence... the mystery surrounding this threat will be revealed.
I will retire.
I' il have an offiicer stationed on every floor, and I' il be in the control center downstairs.
Mesa busten wit happiness seein yousa again, Ani.
She hardly even recognized me, Jar Jar.
I' ve thought about her every day since we parted, and... she' s forgotten me completely.
Happier den mesa seein her in a longo time.
You' re focusing on the negative, Anakin.
She was pleased to see us.
Now, let' s check the security.
I hit the ship, but they used a decoy.
We' il have to try something more subtle this time, Zam.
My client is getting impatient.
They' re very poisonous.
Zam, there can be no mistakes this time.
Captain Typho has more than enough men downstairs.
No assassin would try that way.
- Quiet as a tomb.
I don' t like just waiting here for something to happen to her.
- [Beeping]
- What' s going on?
Ah, she covered the cameras.
I don' t think she liked me watching her.
She programmed R2 to warn us if there is an intruder.
[Obi- Wan]
I know, but we also want to catch this assassin, don' t we, Master?
You' re using her as bait.
Don' t worry.
I can sense everything going on in that room.
Trust me.
Besides, your senses aren' t that attuned, my young apprentice.
And yours are?
Possibly.
You look tired.
Because of your mother?
I don' t know why I keep dreaming about her.
Dreams pass in time.
I' d much rather dream about Padmé.
Just being around her again is... intoxicating.
Be mindful of your thoughts, Anakin.
You' ve made a commitment to the Jedi order, a commitment not easily broken.
And don' t forget, she' s a politician, and they' re not to be trusted.
[Anakin]
[Obi- Wan]
It is my experience that senators... focus only on pleasing those who fund their campaigns... and they' re in no means scared of forgetting the niceties of democracy...
At least not on the economics of politics.
And besides, you' re generalizing.
- The chancellor doesn' t appear to be corrupt.
I have observed that he is very clever... in following the passions and the prejudices of the senators.
My --
I sense it too.
Stay here!
Are you all right, milady?
- What took you so long?
- There he is. with the open cockpit and the right speed capabilities.
If you spent as much time practicing your saber techniques as you do your wit... you would rival Master Yoda as a swordsman.
- Only in your mind, my very young apprentice.
- Pull up, Anakin.
Pull up!
- You know I don' t like it when you do that.
- Sorry, Master.
I don' t mind flying, but what you' re doing is suicide.
Anakin!
- Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! - stay away from power couplings!
That was good!
Where are you going?
He went that way.
Master, if we keep this chase going any longer... that creep is gonna end up deep- fried... and, personally, I' d very much like to fiind out who he is and who he' s working for.
This is a shortcut.
I think.
Well, you' ve lost him.
I' m deeply sorry, Master.
That was some shortcut, Anakin.
He went completely the other way.
- Once again you' ve proved -- - If you' il excuse me.
I hate it when he does that.
Anakin!
- Patience.
Use the Force.
- Sorry, Master.
- He went in there to hide, not to run.
- Next time, try not to lose it.
- Yes, Master.
- This weapon is your life.
I try, Master.
Why do I get the feeling you' re going to be the death of me?
You' re the closest thing I have to a father.
- I am trying.
- Can you see him?
- I think he is a she... and I think she is a changeling.
In that case, be extra careful.
- Go and fiind her.
For a drink.
Thank you.
You wanna buy some death sticks?
You don' t want to sell me death sticks.
- You want to go home...
- I want to go home and rethink my life.
[Moaning, Grunting]
Go back to your drinks.
- Do you know who it was you were trying to kill?
It was a senator from Naboo.
And who hired you?
Who hired you?
Tell us now!
It was a bounty hunter called -- [Gagging]
Toxic dart.
Track down this bounty hunter you must, Obi- Wan.
Most importantly, fiind out who he' s working for.
What about Senator Amidala?
She will still need protecting.
Handle that your Padawan will.
Anakin, escort the senator back to her home planet of Naboo.
Travel as refugees.
As the leader of the opposition, it will be very diffiicult... to get Senator Amidala to leave the capital.
Until caught this killer is... our judgment she must respect.
Anakin, go to the senate... and ask Chancellor Palpatine to speak with her about this matter.
I will talk with her.
I know her well enough to assure you of that.
Thank you, Your Excellency.
And so, they' ve fiinally given you an assignment.
Your patience has paid off.
Your guidance more than my patience.
You don' t need guidance, Anakin.
In time, you will learn to trust your feelings.
Then you will be invincible.
I have said it many times:
You are the most gifted Jedi I have ever met.
He is not ready to be given this assignment on his own yet.
The council is confiident in its decision, Obi- Wan.
[Windu]
But he still has much to learn, Master.
His abilities have made him, well, arrogant.
A flaw more and more common among Jedi.
Too sure of themselves they are.
Even the older, more experienced ones.
Remember, Obi- Wan, if the prophecy is true... your apprentice is the only one who can bring the Force back into balance.
[Padmé]
It will be your responsibility to take my place in the senate.
- Representative Binks, I know I can count on you.
Mesa accept this with muy, muy humility and, uh --
Milady.
I do not like this idea of hiding.
Now that the council has ordered an investigation... it won' t take Master Obi- Wan long to fiind this bounty hunter.
I haven' t worked for a year to defeat the Military Creation Act... to not be here when its fate is decided.
Sometimes we must let go of our pride and do what is requested of us.
Anakin, you' ve grown up.
Master Obi- Wan manages not to see it.
Obi- Wan is a great mentor.
As wise as Master Yoda and... as powerful as Master Windu.
I am truly thankful to be his apprentice.
I' m really ahead of him.
I' m ready for the trials... but he feels that I' m too unpredictable.
He won' t let me move on.
- That must be frustrating.
- It' s worse.
He never listens.
He -- He doesn' t understand.
All mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like.
It' s the only way we grow.
[Sighs]
I know.
Anakin.
Don' t try to grow up too fast.
You said it yourself.
Please don' t look at me like that.
- Why not?
- It makes me feel uncomfortable.
Sorry, milady.
- Be safe, milady.
- Thank you, Captain.
Take good care of Dormé.
He' il be safe with me.
- You' il be fiine.
I worry about you.
What if they realize you' ve left the capital?
Well, then my Jedi protector will have to prove how good he is.
Don' t do anything without fiirst consulting either myself or the council.
Yes, Master.
You' il be back here in no time.
I' il be most grateful for your speed, Master Jedi.
- It' s time to go.
Anakin, may the Force be with you.
May the Force be with you, Master.
Suddenly I' m afraid.
This is my fiirst assignment on my own.
I am too.
- [Laughing]
I do hope he doesn' t try anything foolish.
I' d be more concerned about her doing something than him.
Jedi, by the looks of him.
- Obi- Wan!
I' il be right with ya.
- Oh, yes.
Thank you.
[Both Laughing]
So, my friend, what can I do for ya?
You can tell me what this is.
Well, whattaya know!
I ain' t seen one of these since I was prospectin '... on Subterrel, beyond the outer rim.
[Obi- Wan]
Can you tell me where it came from?
This baby belongs to them cloners.
What you got here is a Kamino saberdart.
I wonder why it didn' t show up in the analysis archives.
It' s these funny little cuts on the side that give it away.
Those analysis droids only focus on symbols.
wisdom.
Well, if droids could think, there' d be none of us here, would there?
Kamino.
I' m not familiar with it.
It' s beyond the outer rim.
I' d say about, uh, 12 parsecs... outside the Rishi Maze.
[Chuckles]
These, uh, Kaminoans keep to themselves.
Damn good ones too.
- Cloners.
Are they friendly?
Depends on what, Dex?
On how good your manners are... and how big your, uh... pocketbook is.
Did you call for assistance?
- Yes, yes, I did.
- Are you having a problem, Master Kenobi?
Yes, um, I' m looking for a planetary system called Kamino.
- It doesn' t show up on the archive charts.
It' s not a system I' m familiar with.
Are you sure you have the right coordinates?
According to my information, it should appear in this quadrant here... just south of the Rishi Maze.
I hate to say it, but it looks like the system you' re searching for... doesn' t exist.
Perhaps the archives are incomplete.
If an item does not appear in our records... it does not exist.
- [Beeping]
- [Chirping]
- Must be diffiicult, having sworn your life to the Jedi... not being able to visit the places you like or do the things you like.
Are you allowed to love?
I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi.
Possession is forbidden.
Compassion, which I would defiine as unconditional love... is central to a Jedi' s life.
So you might say that we are encouraged to love.
- You' ve changed so much.
- Ah, you haven' t changed a bit.
You' re exactly the way I remember you in my dreams.
Sense the Force around you.
Use your feelings you must.
A visitor we have.
Hello, Master Obi- Wan.
I' m sorry to disturb you, Master.
What help can I be, Obi- Wan?
I' m looking for a planet described to me by an old friend.
I trust him, but the systems don' t show on the archive maps.
- How embarrassing.
How embarrassing.
Liam, the shades.
Clear your minds... and fiind Obi- Wan' s wayward planet we will.
It ought to be... here... but it isn' t.
Gravity is pulling all the stars in the area towards this spot.
Gravity' s silhouette remains... but the star and all the planets... disappeared they have.
How can this be?
A thought?
- [Yoda]
Master?
Truly wonderful the mind of a child is.
The Padawan is right.
Go to the center of gravity' s pull... and fiind your planet you will.
The data must have been erased.
That' s impossible, isn' t it?
Dangerous and disturbing this puzzle is.
But who and why, harder to answer.
Meditate on this I will.
I wasn' t the youngest queen ever elected... but now that I think back on it, I' m not sure I was old enough.
The people you served thought you did a good job.
I heard they even tried to amend the constitution so you could stay in offiice.
I was relieved when my two terms were up.
I couldn' t refuse her.
I agree with her.
I think the Republic needs you.
I' m glad that you chose to serve.
If the senate votes to create an army...
- I' m sure it' s going to push us into a civil war.
There hasn' t been a full- scale war since the formation of the Republic.
Do you see any way through negotiations... to bring the separatists back into the Republic?
Not if they feel threatened.
My guess is they' il turn to the Trade Federations or the Commerce Guilds for help.
Nute Gunray is still the viceroy of the Trade Federation.
I fear the senate is powerless to resolve this crisis.
We must keep our faith in the Republic.
The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it.
Let' s pray that day never comes.
In the meantime, we must consider your own safety.
What is your suggestion, Master Jedi?
Oh, Anakin' s not a Jedi yet.
He' s still a Padawan learner.
But I was thinking --
- Hold on a minute.
I was thinking I would stay in the lake country.
There are some places up there that are very isolated.
I' m in charge of security here, milady.
And this is my home.
That is why we' re here.
I think it would be wise if you took advantage of my knowledge in this instance.
Sorry, milady.
[Queen Jamillia]
It' s settled, then.
There it is, R4, right where it should be.
Our missing planet Kamino.
The prime minister is expecting you.
- I' m expected?
After all these years... we were beginning to think you weren' t coming.
Now, please, this way.
May I present Lama Su... prime minister of Kamino.
And this is Master Jedi --
Please.
And now to business.
You will be delighted to hear that we are on schedule.
200, 000 units are ready... with a million more well on the way.
That' s good news.
Please tell your Master Sifo- Dyas... that his order will be met on time.
I' m sorry.
Jedi Master Sifo- Dyas is still a leading member of the Jedi Council... is he not?
Master Sifo- Dyas was killed almost ten years ago.
Oh, I' m so sorry to hear that.
But I' m sure he would have been proud of the army we' ve built for him.
- The army?
A clone army, and I must say, one of the fiinest we' ve ever created.
Tell me, Prime Minister... when my master fiirst contacted you about the army... did -- did he say who it was for?
This army is for the Republic.
But you must be anxious to inspect the units for yourself.
That' s why I' m here.
We used to come here for school retreat.
We would swim to that island every day.
I love the water.
We used to lie out on the sand and let the sun dry us... and try to guess the names of the birds singing.
I don' t like sand.
It' s coarse and rough and irritating... and it gets everywhere.
Not like here.
Here, everything is soft... and smooth.
I shouldn' t have done that.
I' m sorry.
- Very impressive.
- I' d hoped you would be pleased.
Clones can think creatively.
You will fiind that they are immensely superior to droids.
We take great pride in our combat education and training programs.
This group was created about fiive years ago.
You mentioned growth acceleration.
Oh, yes, it' s essential.
Otherwise, a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow.
Now we can do it in half the time.
They are totally obedient... taking any order without question.
We modifiied their genetic structure... to make them less independent than the original host.
And who was the original host?
A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.
And where is this bounty hunter now?
Oh, we keep him here.
Fett demanded only one thing: an unaltered clone for himself.
- Curious, isn' t it?
Pure genetic replication.
I should very much like to meet this Jango Fett.
I would be very happy to arrange it for you.
Magnifiicent, aren' t they?
- I don' t know.
Sure you do.
You gonna use one of your Jedi mind tricks on me?
They only work on the weak- minded.
All right.
We were both in the Legislative Youth Program.
Dark, curly hair.
All right, I get the picture.
Whatever happened to him?
I went into public service; he went on to become an artist.
- You really don' t like politicians, do you?
[Both Chuckle]
I don' t think the system works.
How would you have it work?
We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problem... agree what' s in the best interest of all the people, and then do it.
The trouble is that people don' t always agree.
Well, then they should be made to.
- By whom?
You?
- I don' t know.
Someone.
- But someone.
Someone wise.
Sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me.
Well, if it works.
- No.
I' d be much too frightened to tease a senator.
Ani!
Ani, are you all right?
Boba, is your father here?
Yep.
May we see him?
Sure.
Dad, Taun We' s here.
Jango, welcome back.
Was your trip productive?
Fairly.
This is Jedi Master Obi- Wan Kenobi.
He' s come to check on our progress.
You must be very proud.
I' m just a simple man trying to make my way in the universe.
Ever made your way as far into the interior as Coruscant?
- Once or twice.
- Recently?
Possibly.
Then you must know Master Sifo- Dyas.
Master who?
Is he not the Jedi who hired you for this job?
Never heard of him.
Really?
I was recruited by a man called Tyranus on one of the moons of Bogden.
Curious.
Do you like your army?
I look forward to seeing them in action.
They' il do their job well.
I' il guarantee that.
Thank you for your time, Jango.
Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.
What is it, Dad?
Pack your things.
We' re leaving.
And when I got to them, we went into aggressive negotiations.
"Aggressive negotiations"?
- [Laughing]
If Master Obi- Wan caught me doing this, he' d be very grumpy.
From the moment I met you... all those years ago... not a day has gone by when I haven' t thought of you.
I' m in agony.
The closer I get to you, the worse it gets.
I can' t breathe.
I' m haunted by the kiss that you should never have given me.
My heart is beating... hoping that that kiss will not become a scar.
You are in my very soul... tormenting me.
What can I do?
I will do anything that you ask.
If you are suffering as much as I am, please, tell me.
I can' t.
It' s... just not possible.
Listen to me.
No, you listen.
Come back to it.
I' m -- I' m a senator.
If you follow your thoughts through to conclusion... it' il take us to a place we cannot go... regardless of the way we feel about each other.
Then you do feel something.
I will not let you give up your future for me.
That is something I know I cannot do.
Believe me, I wish that I could just wish away my feelings... but I can' t.
I will not give in to this.
Well, you know, it... wouldn' t have to be that way.
We could keep it a secret.
We' d be living a lie... one we couldn' t keep even if we wanted to.
I couldn' t do that.
Could you live like that?
No.
You' re right.
It would destroy us.
Tell your council that the fiirst battalions are ready.
And remind them, if they need more troops... it will take more time to grow them.
- I won' t forget, and thank you.
- Thank you.
Scramble code fiive to Coruscant, care of the old folks' home!
I have successfully made contact with the prime minister of Kamino.
They are using a bounty hunter named Jango Fett to create a clone army.
I have a strong feeling that this bounty hunter... is the assassin we are looking for.
Do you think these cloners are involved in the plot to assassinate Senator Amidala?
There appears to be no motive.
Do not assume anything, Obi- Wan.
Clear your mind must be... if you are to discover the real villains behind this plot.
Yes, Master.
They say Master Sifo- Dyas placed an order for a clone army... at the request of the senate almost ten years ago.
I was under the impression he was killed before that.
Did the council ever authorize the creation of a clone army?
Whoever placed that order did not have the authorization of the Jedi Council.
Bring him here.
Question him we will.
Yes, Master.
I will report back when I have him.
[Sighs]
I think it is time we informed the senate... that our ability to use the Force has diminished.
Only the dark lord of the Sith knows of our weakness.
If informed the senate is... multiply our adversaries will.
No.
Don' t.
Don' t go.
I don' t want to disturb you.
Your presence is soothing.
You had another nightmare last night.
Jedi don' t have nightmares.
I heard you.
I saw my mother.
She is suffering, Padmé.
I saw her as clearly as I see you now.
She is in pain.
I know I' m disobeying my mandate to protect you, Senator... but I have to go.
I have to help her.
I' il go with you.
I don' t have a choice.
Dad, look!
Boba, get on board!
[Grunts]
- Wait right there.
Let me help you with that.
What?
What do you want?
Wait!
Whatever it is, I didn' t do it.
I' m looking for Shmi Skywalker.
- Ani?
Little Ani?
[Laughing]
A Jedi!
[Chuckles]
My mother.
Shmi.
I sold her.
- You sold her?
Sorry, Ani, but you know, business is business, huh?
Yeah, I sold her to a moisture farmer named, uh, Lars.
At least I think it was Lars.
[Chuckles]
Do you know where they are now?
Someplace over on the other side of Mos Eisley, I think, mmm.
I' d like to know.
Eh, sure.
[Chuckles]
[Chuckles]
I think we' re being tracked!
He must have put a homing device on our hull.
We' il move into the asteroid fiield... and we' il have a couple of surprises for him.
[Cackling]
Seismic charges!
Stand by.
He doesn' t seem to take a hint, this guy.
Watch out!
Get him!
Oh, blast!
This is why I hate flying!
- We' iljust have to fiinish him.
See you tomorrow.
I' m in.
We' re almost there.
- Sir, are you sure about this?
- I told you, we' re going to be all right.
It' s just that I' m scoping some serious sentinel activity up here.
- Link.
Given your situation, I can' t say I understand your reasons...... for volunteering to operate onboard my ship.
However, if you wish to continue to do so, I must ask you to do one thing.
What' s that, sir?
To trust me.
I will, sir.
- I mean, I do, sir.
Yes, sir.
Still can' t sleep?
You wanna talk?
They' re just dreams.
If you' re afraid of something....
I just wish....
That' s all.
I just wish I knew.
She' s gonna call.
Here you are.
- Are we ready to go?
- We' re already late.
These geotherms confirm the last transmission of the Osiris.
The machines are digging.
They' re boring from the surface down to Zion.
- Mother -- - They' il avoid the perimeter defense.
How fast are they moving?
Control estimates their descent at 100 meters an hour.
- How deep are they?
- Almost 2000 meters.
- What about the scans from the Osiris?
- They can' t be accurate.
- They may be.
- It' s not possible.
That' d mean there are a quarter- million sentinels.
- That' s right.
- That can' t be.
Why not?
A sentinel for every man, woman and child in Zion.
That sounds exactly like the thinking of a machine to me.
Niobe.
My apologies to all.
But as you are undoubtedly aware...... it' s become difficult to locate a secure broadcast position.
- Squiddies got our best spots.
And if Niobe' s right, in 72 hours there' s gonna be a quarter- million more.
What are we gonna do?
We' re gonna do what Commander Lock ordered.
We' il evacuate broadcast level and return to Zion.
And does the commander have a plan for stopping 250, 000 sentinels?
A strategy is still being formulated.
I' m sure it is.
What do you think we should do, Morpheus?
- We should proceed as ordered...
- What is it?
I don' t know.... however, I must ask one of you for help.
Some of you believe as I believe, some of you do not.
Those of you that do...... know we are nearing the end of our struggle.
The prophecy will be fulfilled soon.
But before it can be...... the Oracle must be consulted.
If we return and recharge now...... we can be back in 36 hours, well before the machines reach this depth.
Do you understand what you' re asking?
I am asking that one ship remain here in our place...... in case the Oracle should attempt to contact us.
Bullshit.
That' s right, I am.
But we well know that the reason most of us are here...... is because of our affinity for disobedience.
What happens when you get back to Zion...... and the commander throws you in the stockade?
He won' t.
Goddamn it, Morpheus, you ain' t never gonna change.
Shit, I' il do it just to see what Deadbolt does to you.
You got 36 hours.
I' m looking for Neo.
- Never heard of him.
- I have something for him.
A gift.
You see, he set me free.
Fine, whatever.
Now piss off.
- Who was that?
- How did you know someone was here?
He gave you this.
He said you set him free.
Is everything all right, sir?
The meeting is over.
Retreat to your exits.
- Agents are coming.
Go.
- It' s him.
- The anomaly.
- Do we proceed?
- Yes.
- He is still -- - Only human.
Upgrades.
- That went as expected.
- Yes.
It' s happening exactly as before.
Well, not exactly.
- What happened?
- I can' t figure it out.
Agents just came out of nowhere.
Then the code got all weird.
Encryption I' ve never seen.
- Okay?
Shit, you should' ve seen him.
Where is he now?
He' s doing his Superman thing.
Where are you?
This is the Nebuchadnezzar, requesting access through Gate Three.
Nebuchadnezzar, this is Zion Control.
Maintain present velocity and stand by.
This is Control requesting immediate stand- down of arms at Gate Three.
We have the Nebuchadnezzar on approach.
Let' s open her up.
Roger that, Control.
Welcome home.
No place like it.
Zion Control, stand by for Gate Three lockdown.
Bay Seven.
Understood.
Captain Mifune.
Captain Morpheus.
Are you here to escort me to the stockade, captain?
- I' m just here to keep the peace.
Requests your immediate counsel, sir.
- Link.
Understood, sir.
- Morpheus and Lock?
- Captain Niobe?
Now she' s with Lock.
What happened?
Morpheus went to the Oracle.
After that, everything changed.
Yeah, she can do that.
Neo!
- How does he always know?
Doesn' t he have anything better to do?
You know what they say about the life you save.
I didn' t save his life.
Hiya, Neo.
- Trinity, Link.
- It' s great to have you back.
- Thanks.
It' s good to be back.
- Can I carry that for you?
- No, I can carry my own bag.
- Trinity?
- I' m fine.
- You can carry these.
- Yeah, sure, Link.
I' ve been thinking about it, and I' ve made my decision.
Let me guess.
I want to join the Nebuchadnezzar.
Morpheus hasn' t filled the other positions, except for you, Link.
I' m sure he has reasons...... but the more I think about it, the more I think it' s meant to be.
You know, it' s fate.
You' re the reason I' m here, Neo.
I didn' t find you.
I know, but you got me out.
You saved me.
You saved yourself.
- Morpheus.
- Commander Lock.
I wanted to offer you a chance to explain your actions.
I wasn' t aware that my actions required any explanation.
You were given an order to return to Zion.
- I did.
- You asked for one ship to remain behind.
I would have stayed, but I needed to recharge my ship.
So you admit to a direct contravention of your duty.
We need a presence inside the Matrix to await contact from the Oracle.
I don' t want to hear that shit!
I don' t care about oracles or prophecies or messiahs!
To do that I need soldiers to obey my orders.
With all due respect, commander, there is only one way to save our city.
How?
- Neo.
- Goddamn it, Morpheus.
Not everyone believes what you believe.
My beliefs do not require them to.
Everyone' s talking.
A lot of people are scared.
No one remembers the last time so many ships were docked.
- Hey.
We' re not allowed to say anything, so stop asking.
Goddamn, it' s good to be home.
I' m recommending that you be removed from duty.
That is, of course, your prerogative, commander.
If it were up to me, you wouldn' t set foot on a ship for the rest of your life.
Then I am grateful that it is not up to you.
- Councillor Hamann.
- Commander.
- Captain.
- Councillor.
Council' s asked me to speak tonight at the temple gathering.
The presence of the fleet and the persistence of rumors must be addressed.
Of course, councillor.
But might I advise a level of discretion concerning specific details.
- We do not wish to start a panic.
- Quite right.
A panic is not what anyone wants.
What would you advise?
The truth.
No one will panic, because there is nothing to fear.
That army won' t reach the gates of Zion.
- What makes you so sure?
- Consider what we have seen, councillor.
Consider that in the past six months...... we have freed more minds than in six years.
This attack is an act of desperation.
I believe very soon the prophecy will be fulfilled and this war will end.
I hope you' re right, captain.
I do not believe it to be a matter of hope, councillor.
It is simply a matter of time.
My stop.
Hopefully not too soon.
Let' s go, kid.
These two got things to do.
Are you thinking what I' m thinking?
I am if you' re thinking this elevator is too slow.
- How long do we charge the Neb?
- Twenty- four, maybe 30 hours.
Some people go their entire lives without hearing news that good.
Neo, please, I have a son, Jacob, aboard the Gnosis.
- Please, watch over him.
- I' il try.
I have a daughter on the Icarus.
No, wait.
They need you.
- I know.
There' s time.
- Hey!
- Uncle Link!
Oh, my God!
- No!
Now, we' re gonna have to work together here, okay?
Oh, my God!
Come on, kids.
It' s time to go.
- Hey.
- Good to have you home, Link.
- Good to be home.
You be careful with her.
He' s the one that' s gonna get it.
Both of you, march!
I' m gonna get what?
Every ship up there' s been home two, even three times more than the Nebuchadnezzar.
Come on, Zee.
I thought we were past this.
- I can' t do that.
- Why?
- You know why.
Maybe.
But it' s too late now.
I made a promise, and some promises can' t be unmade.
- It' s not fair.
- Nobody said it was gonna be.
You think Cas thinks it' s fair that I' m here and Dozer' s not?
I lost two brothers to that ship, Link.
I' m afraid of it.
It won' t.
How can you say that to me?
Because of Morpheus.
He said that this is it, that it will be over soon.
- Link, Morpheus is crazy.
But Tank and Dozer believed him.
And I' il tell you what...... after being on that ship and seeing Neo do the things he can do, I gotta say...... l' m starting to believe him too.
Be careful, Link.
Please be careful.
- They started yet?
- Only Councillor Hamann' s opening prayer.
These are our husbands and wives, our brothers and sisters...... our children.
Let us remember those that have been lost...... and let us give thanks for those that have been found...... and who stand here beside us.
Now I would like someone else to close this prayer...... someone who hasn' t spoken here in a long time...... but who I believe has something to say that we all need to hear.
I give you Morpheus.
Zion!
Hear me!
It is true what many of you have heard.
The machines have gathered an army, and as I speak...... that army is drawing nearer to our home.
Believe me when I say we have a difficult time ahead of us.
But if we are to be prepared for it, we must first shed our fear of it.
I stand here before you now truthfully unafraid.
Why?
Because I believe something you do not?
No!
I stand here without fear because I remember.
I remember that I am here not because of the path that lies before me...... but because of the path that lies behind me.
I remember that for 100 years we have fought these machines.
And after a century of war, I remember that which matters most:
We are still here!
Tonight...... let us send a message to that army.
Tonight, let us shake this cave.
Tonight, let us tremble these halls...... of earth, steel and stone.
Let us be heard from red core to black sky.
This is Zion and we are not afraid!
I remember.
I remember you used to dance.
I remember you were pretty good.
There are some things in this world, Captain Niobe...... that will never change.
Niobe!
Some things do change.
Excuse me.
- I missed you.
- I can tell.
I was thinking, everyone is here.
Follow me.
Neo, what is it?
What' s wrong?
It' s okay, you can tell me.
Trinity....
Don' t be afraid.
I can' t lose you.
You' re not gonna lose me.
You feel this?
I' m never letting go.
Good night, Zion.
Sweet dreams.
- You all right?
- I' il make it.
Did you see that agent?
I' ve never seen anything like that.
All that matters is this.
You first.
- Oh, God.
- "Smith" will suffice.
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.
- Care for some company?
- Councillor Hamann.
I don' t want to intrude if you' d prefer to be alone.
- No, I could probably use some company.
So could I.
Very calm.
It feels like everyone is sleeping very peacefully.
Not everyone.
I hate sleeping.
I never sleep more than a few hours.
I figure I slept the first 11 years of my life, now I' m making up for it.
- What about you?
- I just haven' t been able to sleep much.
- It' s a good sign.
- Of what?
That you are in fact still human.
Have you ever been to the engineering level?
I love to walk there at night.
It' s quite amazing.
- Would you like to see it?
- Sure.
Unless, of course, there' s a problem.
Nobody cares how it works as long as it works.
I like it down here.
I like to be reminded this city survives because of these machines.
These machines are keeping us alive while other machines are coming to kill us.
Interesting, isn' t it?
-... and the power to end it.
- We have the same power.
Yeah, I suppose we do, but...... sometimes I think about those people still plugged into the Matrix.
And when I look at these machines...... I can' t help thinking that, in a way, we are plugged into them.
Of course not.
How could they?
The idea is pure nonsense...... but it does make one wonder just...... what is control?
If we wanted, we could shut these machines down.
Of course.
You hit it.
That' s control, isn' t it?
If we wanted, we could smash them to bits.
Although if we did, we' d have to consider what would happen to our lights...... our heat, our air.
So we need machines and they need us.
No point.
Old men like me don' t bother with making points.
There' s no point.
Is that why there are no young men on the Council?
Good point.
Why don' t you tell me what' s on your mind, councillor.
There is so much in this world...... that I do not understand.
See that machine?
It has something to do with recycling our water supply.
I have absolutely no idea how it works.
But I do understand the reason for it to work.
I have absolutely no idea how you are able to do some of the things you do.
But I believe there' s a reason for that as well.
I only hope we understand that reason before it' s too late.
- Ballard.
- ls he here?
Neo, it' s from the Oracle.
It' s time to go.
Morpheus said this was how it was gonna happen.
I don' t know.
Maybe the prophecy' s true, maybe it' s not.
All I know is, that ship needs an operator.
Right now, that operator' s me.
I know.
- I want you to wear it.
- You know I don' t believe in this stuff.
- But I do.
It' s always brought me luck.
- Maybe it' il bring me you.
- I' m coming back.
I promise.
No matter what it takes, I' m coming home.
Just keep it with you.
Please.
Okay.
- Neo!
- How the hell --?
Bane.
Is something wrong?
No, I' m fine.
I just wanted to catch you to say...... good luck.
Thanks.
We' il see you.
Neo!
Just in time.
- You' re gonna see the Oracle?
- There' s no time.
I had to give something to Neo.
A gift from one of the orphans.
He made me swear to get it to you before you left.
He said you' d understand.
Thanks.
I was just told you cleared the Nebuchadnezzar for takeoff.
That is correct.
Am I still in charge of our defense system?
Of course.
I believe I need every ship we have if we' re going to survive this attack.
I understand that, commander.
Then why did you allow the Nebuchadnezzar to leave?
Because I believe our survival depends on more than how many ships we have.
Be careful.
Hello.
- You seek the Oracle.
- Who are you?
I am Seraph.
I can take you to her, but first I must apologize.
Apologize for what?
For this.
Good.
I had to be sure.
- That you are the One.
- No.
You do not truly know someone...... until you fight them.
Come.
She' s waiting.
Where the hell did they go?
These are back doors, aren' t they?
Programmer access.
- How do they work?
- A code is hidden in tumblers.
One position opens a lock and another position opens one of these doors.
Are you a programmer?
Then what are you?
I protect that which matters most.
I ain' t gonna bite you.
Come around here and let me have a look at you.
My goodness, look at you.
You turned out all right, didn' t you?
- How do you feel?
I know you' re not sleeping.
We' il get to that.
Why don' t you come and have a sit this time.
- Maybe I' il stand.
- Well, suit yourself.
- I felt like sitting.
- I know.
So...... let' s get the obvious stuff out of the way.
- You' re not human, are you?
- It' s tough to get more obvious than that.
If I had to guess, I' d say you' re a program from the machine world.
- So is he.
- So far, so good.
But if that' s true, that could mean you' re part of this system...... another kind of control.
- Keep going.
- I suppose the most obvious question is...
-... how can I trust you?
It is a pickle, no doubt about it.
Bad news is...... there' s no way you can really know if I' m here to help you or not.
So it' s really up to you.
Just have to make up your own damn mind...... to either accept what I' m going to tell you or reject it.
Candy?
- Do you already know if I' il take it?
- Wouldn' t be much of an oracle if I didn' t.
But if you already know, how can I make a choice?
Because you didn' t come here to make the choice.
You' ve already made it.
You' re here to try to understand why you made it.
I thought you' d have figured that out by now.
- Why are you here?
- Same reason.
I love candy.
But why help us?
We' re all here to do what we' re all here to do.
I' m interested in one thing, Neo: the future.
And believe me, I know, the only way to get there is together.
- Are there other programs like you?
- Well, not like me, but....
See those birds?
At some point, a program was written to govern them.
A program was written to watch over the trees and the wind, the sunrise and sunset.
There are programs running all over the place.
The ones doing their job, doing what they were meant to do, are invisible.
You' d never even know they were here.
But the other ones....
Well, you hear about them all the time.
- I' ve never heard of them.
- Of course you have.
Every time you' ve heard someone say they saw a ghost or an angel...... every story you' ve ever heard about vampires, werewolves or aliens...... is the system assimilating some program...... that' s doing something they' re not supposed to be doing.
Programs hacking programs.
- Why?
- They have their reasons...... but usually a program chooses exile when it faces deletion.
- And why would a program be deleted?
- Maybe it breaks down.
Maybe a better program is created to replace it.
Happens all the time.
And when it does, a program can either choose to hide here...... or return to the source.
- The machine mainframe.
Where you must go.
Where the path of the One ends.
You' ve seen it...... in your dreams, haven' t you?
A door made of light?
What happens when you go through the door?
I see Trinity...... and something happens...... something bad.
She starts to fall, and then I wake up.
- Do you see her die?
- No.
You have the sight now, Neo.
You are looking at the world without time.
Then why can' t I see what happens to her?
We can never see past the choices we don' t understand.
Are you saying I have to choose whether Trinity lives or dies?
No, you' ve already made the choice.
Now you have to understand it.
No.
I can' t do that.
I won' t.
- Well, you have to.
- Why?
Because you' re the One.
What if I can' t?
What happens if I fail?
Then Zion will fall.
Our time is up.
The Keymaker?
He disappeared.
We didn' t know what happened to him until now.
He' s being held prisoner by a very dangerous program...... one of the oldest of us.
- And he won' t let him go willingly.
- What does he want?
What do all men with power want?
More power.
Be there at that exact time...... and you will have a chance.
We must go.
Seems like every time we meet I got nothing but bad news.
I surely am.
But for what it' s worth...... you' ve made a believer out of me.
Good luck, kiddo.
Mr. Anderson.
Did you get my package?
- Yeah.
- Well, good.
- Smith?
- He' s not reading like an agent.
- Surprised to see me?
- Of what?
Our connection.
I don' t fully understand how it happened.
Perhaps some part of you imprinted onto me...... something overwritten or copied.
It is, at this point, irrelevant.
What matters is...... that whatever happened, happened for a reason.
And what reason is that?
I killed you, Mr. Anderson.
I watched you die.
With a certain satisfaction, I might add.
And then something happened, something that I knew was impossible...... but it happened anyway.
You destroyed me, Mr. Anderson.
Afterward, I knew the rules, I understood what I was supposed to do...... but I didn' t.
I couldn' t.
I was compelled to stay...... compelled to disobey.
And now, here I stand because of you, Mr. Anderson.
Because of you, I' m no longer an agent of this system.
Because of you, I' ve changed.
I' m unplugged.
Like you, apparently free.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
But as you well know, appearances can be deceiving...... which brings me back to the reason why we' re here.
We' re not here because we' re free.
We' re here because we are not free.
-... we would not exist.
- It is purpose that created us.
- Purpose that connects us.
- That guides us.
- That drives us.
- It is purpose that defines.
- Purpose that binds us.
We are here because of you, Mr. Anderson.
We' re here to take from you what you tried to take from us:
Purpose.
- What' s happening to him?
- Don' t know.
Yes, that' s it.
- You.
- Yes, me.
Me, me, me.
Me too.
More.
It is inevitable.
Come on, get out of there.
Are you all right?
- It was Smith.
- Now there' s more than one of them?
- A lot more.
- How is that possible?
- I don' t know.
Somehow, he' s found a way to copy himself.
- I don' t know what he was doing...
-... but I know what it felt like.
- What?
It felt like I was back in that hallway.
It felt like dying.
The machines are tunneling to avoid our defense system.
But I believe they will intersect certain pipelines to control them.
These points of intersection are crucial...... because I believe they' re vulnerable to counterattack.
This is the single greatest threat we have ever faced...... and if we do not act accordingly, we will not survive.
Commander Lock, the Council is well aware of the seriousness of this attack.
You have our leave to prepare our defense by any and all means necessary.
- Thank you, Council.
- However...... we ask if there' s been word from the Nebuchadnezzar.
No, councillor.
Nothing.
Then we request a ship be dispatched to ascertain the fate of the One.
-... can suffer the loss of another ship.
- It will, commander, if it must.
It could take one ship days to find the Nebuchadnezzar.
- Then send two.
- This is insane.
Careful, commander.
Forgive my frustration, councillors.
But I wish I were able to comprehend the Council' s choice in this matter.
Comprehension is not a requisite of cooperation.
There' s no need for such an order.
They can answer for themselves.
The Council is calling for two volunteers to aid the Nebuchadnezzar.
Are there two among you that would answer such a call?
Captain Soren of the Vigilant will answer the Council' s call.
You understand the situation, Captain Soren?
- Yes, ma' am.
- Thank you, captain.
Is there another?
- What?
You have gone crazy.
- Listen -- - Shut your hole, Bane...... before I put you in one.
Is there no other?
Be hard for any man to risk his life...... especially if he doesn' t understand the reason.
Captain Niobe of the Logos will answer the councillor' s call.
- Thank you, Captain Niobe.
Commander Lock, you have your orders.
This Council is hereby adjourned.
- Niobe, what are you doing?
- What I can.
Why?
Because some things never change, Jason...... and some things do.
What can you see, Neo?
It' s strange.
The code is somehow different.
- Encrypted?
- Maybe.
Is that good for us or bad for us?
Well, it looks like every floor is wired with explosives.
Bad for us.
Here we go.
We are here to speak with the Merovingian.
Well, of course.
He has been expecting you.
Follow me.
Here he is at last.
Neo, the One himself.
Right?
And the legendary Morpheus.
And Trinity, of course.
You honor me.
Please, sit.
This is my wife, Persephone.
Something to eat?
For the sake of appearances.
- No, thank you.
Who has time?
But then, if we do not ever take time, how can we ever have time?
Château Haut- Briond, 1959.
Magnificent wine.
I love French wine like I love the French language.
I have sampled every language.
French is my favorite.
Fantastic language...... especially to curse with.
It' s like wiping your ass with silk.
I love it.
You know why we are here.
I am a trafficker of information.
I know everything I can.
The question is, do you know why you are here?
We are looking for the Keymaker.
Oh, yes, it is true.
The Keymaker, of course.
But this is not a reason, this is not a why.
The Keymaker himself, his very nature, is a means, it is not an end.
-... what?
- You know the answer to that question.
But do you?
You think you do, but you do not.
You are here because you were sent here.
You were told to come here, and then you obeyed.
It is, of course, the way of all things.
You see, there is only one constant...... one universal.
It is the only real truth.
Causality.
Action, reaction.
- Cause and effect.
No.
Wrong.
Choice is an illusion created between those with power...... and those without.
Look there at that woman.
My God, just look at her...... affecting everyone around her.
But wait.
Watch.
You see, I have sent her a dessert...... a very special dessert.
I wrote it myself.
It starts so simply...... each line of the program creating a new effect, just like...... poetry.
Her heart flutters.
You can see it, Neo, yes?
She does not understand why.
Is it the wine?
No.
What is it then?
What is the reason?
And soon it does not matter.
Soon the why and the reason are gone...... and all that matters is the feeling itself.
And this is the nature of the universe.
It is a lie.
Beneath our poised appearance...... the truth is, we are completely...... out of control.
Causality.
There is no escape from it.
We are forever slaves to it.
Our only hope, our only peace, is to understand it, to understand the why.
"Why" is what separates us from them...... you from me.
"Why" is the only real source of power.
Without it, you are powerless.
And this is how you come to me, without why, without power.
Another link in the chain.
But fear not.
Since I have seen how good you are at following orders...... I will tell you what to do next.
Run back and give the fortuneteller this message:
Her time is almost up.
Now I have some real business to do, so I will say adieu and goodbye.
- This isn' t over.
- Oh, yes, it is.
The Keymaker is mine, and I see no reason why I should give him up.
- No reason at all.
- Where are you going?
We are all victims of causality.
I drank too much wine, I must take a piss.
Au revoir.
Touch me and that hand will never touch anything again.
Well, that didn' t go so well.
Are you certain the Oracle didn' t say anything else?
- Maybe we did something wrong.
Or didn' t do something.
No, what happened couldn' t have happened any other way.
- How do you know?
- We are still alive.
If you want the Keymaker, follow me.
Get out.
I am so sick and tired of his bullshit.
Pompous prick.
A long time ago, when we first came here, it was so different.
He was so different.
He was like you.
I' il give you what you want, but you have to give me something.
- What?
Excuse me?
I want you to kiss me as if you were kissing her.
- Why?
She loves you.
It' s all over you both.
A long time ago, I knew what that felt like.
I want to remember it.
I want to sample it.
That' s all.
- Why don' t you sample this instead?
Such emotion over something so small.
It' s just a kiss.
Why should we trust you?
If I don' t deliver you to the Keymaker, she can kill me.
All right.
But you have to make me believe I am her.
All right.
Terrible.
Forget it.
Wait.
Okay.
Yes.
That' s it.
I envy you.
But such a thing is not meant to last.
Come with me.
Not again.
It' s all right, boys.
They' re with me.
These fellas work for my husband.
They do his dirty work.
They' re very good, very loyal.
Aren' t you, boys?
Yes, mistress.
They come from a much older version of the Matrix.
But like so many back then, they caused more problems than they solved.
My husband saved them because they' re notoriously difficult to terminate.
How many people keep silver bullets in their gun?
You can either run and tell my husband what I have done...... or you can stay there and die.
He' s in the ladies' room!
Hurry.
- My name is Neo.
I' m the Keymaker.
I' ve been waiting for you.
You betray me.
- Cause and effect, my love.
- Cause?
There is no cause for this.
What cause?
What cause?
How about the lipstick you' re still wearing?
Lipstick.
What craziness are you talking about, woman?
There is no lipstick!
She wasn' t kissing your face, my love.
Woman, this is nothing.
It is only a game.
- So is this.
Have fun.
All right.
Let us find out where this goes.
You two, get the Keymaker.
That' s a nice trick.
I cannot go back.
I' il handle them.
You' il handle us?
You know, your predecessors had much more respect.
Okay, you have some skill.
Kill him.
He' s just a man.
Goddamn it, woman, you will be the end of me.
Mark my words, boy, and mark them well.
I have survived your predecessors, and I will survive you.
I got nothing, sir.
No sign of Niobe or Ghost.
Nothing but blue pills.
- Should we try to contact them?
My gut says they' re down.
- We should start back.
- lf that ship can fly, we need it.
I was afraid you' d say that.
Sweep as wide as possible, as fast as possible.
- Lines are crawling with calamari.
- The sooner we find them the better.
- Thought you could use something to eat.
Any change?
No.
- How is he?
- He' s gonna be fine.
At least until he wakes up.
- What do you mean?
- Captain has some questions for him.
He' d better have some good answers.
You see these cuts?
I think they' re self- inflicted.
- Why?
- VDTs maybe.
I don' t know.
But like I said, the answer better be good.
Roland, I' d like to run another search through the Matrix.
- For what?
- For Neo.
How could he be in the Matrix, sir?
He' s not plugged in.
Please, for me.
This is what keeps bothering me.
What?
His neural patterns don' t read like someone who' s in a coma.
The strange thing is, I see these patterns all the time.
- Where?
- On someone jacked in.
{Y: i} The big bupkes.
Nada</ i>.
He' s not in there.
- Sir, I got the projections.
Based on point of entry and the past speed, the machines will be in Zion in 20 hours.
Jesus H. Christ.
All right, let' s move with a purpose.
AK, I want you on holographics.
Mauser, I want forward and aft guns manned at all times.
And make sure we are running on as few pads as possible.
- Hey!
- What?
Operator.
It' s Seraph.
You must come at once.
Good morning.
- Who are you?
Your name is Neo.
My papa says you' re not supposed to be here.
He says you must be lost.
Are you lost, Neo?
- Where am I?
- This is the train station.
- This isn' t the Matrix?
- That' s where the train goes.
That' s where we' re going, but you cannot go with us.
- Why not?
- He won' t let you.
- Who won' t?
I don' t like him.
But my papa says we have to do what the Trainman says...... or else he will leave us here forever and ever.
Morpheus, Trinity, thank you for coming.
One thing I' ve learned in all my years...... is that nothing ever works out the way you want it to.
- Who are you?
- I' m the Oracle.
I wish there was an easy way to get through this, but there ain' t.
I' m sorry this had to happen.
I' m sorry I couldn' t be sitting here like you remember me...
-... but it wasn' t meant to be.
- What happened?
I made a choice, and that choice cost me more than I wanted it to.
What choice?
To help you, to guide Neo.
Now, since the real test for any choice is having to make the same choice again...... knowing full well what it might cost...... I guess I feel pretty good about that choice...... because here I am, at it again.
- Do you know what happened to Neo?
He is trapped in a place between this world and the machine world.
The link is controlled by a program called the Trainman.
He uses it to smuggle programs in and out of the Matrix.
If he finds out where Neo is before you get to him...... then I' m afraid our choices are going to become difficult.
- Why?
- Because of who the Trainman works for.
The Merovingian.
He has placed a bounty on your lives.
You must be careful at all times.
He' il go with you.
For years he has protected me.
I hope he can do the same for you.
Please, follow me.
Oracle....
I know, Morpheus.
I can see you' re filled with doubt, clouded by uncertainty.
After everything that has happened, how can you expect me to believe you?
I don' t.
I expect just what I' ve always expected:
For you to make up your own damn mind.
Believe me or don' t.
All I can do is tell you that your friend is in trouble, and he needs your help.
He needs all our help.
- Are you from the Matrix?
- Yes.
No.
- I mean, I was.
- I had to.
- I had to leave my home too.
Come here, darling.
Leave the poor man in peace.
Yes, Papa.
I am sorry.
- I know you.
- Yes, in the restaurant of the Frenchman.
I am Rama- Kandra.
This is my wife, Kamala.
My daughter, Sati.
We are most honored to meet you.
- You are programs.
I am the power- plant systems manager for recycling operations.
My wife is an interactive software programmer.
She is highly creative.
What are you doing here?
You do not belong here.
Kamala!
Goodness, I apologize.
My wife can be very direct.
It' s okay.
I don' t have an answer.
- I don' t even know where "here" is.
- This place is nowhere.
It is between your world and our world.
- Who' s the Trainman?
- He works for the Frenchman.
Why did I know you would say that?
The Frenchman does not forget, and he does not forgive.
- You know him?
- I know only what I need to know.
I know that if you want to take something from our world into your world...... that does not belong there, you must go to the Frenchman.
Is that what you' re doing here?
- Rama, please.
- I do not want to be cruel, Kamala.
He may never see another face for the rest of his life.
I' m sorry.
- You don' t have to answer that question.
The answer is simple.
I love my daughter very much.
I find her to be the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.
But where we are from, that is not enough.
Every program that is created must have a purpose.
If it does not, it is deleted.
I went to the Frenchman to save my daughter.
- You do not understand.
- I just have never --
Heard a program speak of love.
- It is a human emotion.
What matters is the connection the word implies.
I see that you are in love.
Can you tell me what you would give to hold on to that connection?
Anything.
Then perhaps the reason you are here is not so different than the reason I am here.
That' s him.
Get away from me!
- We don' t want trouble.
- Get the hell away from me!
- We need your help.
I can' t help you!
No one can help you!
Oh, no!
Damn it!
- When is the train due?
It' s not like the Trainman to be late.
- You think it has something to do with me?
Who knows such things?
Only the Oracle.
- You know the Oracle?
- Everyone knows the Oracle.
I consulted with her before I met with the Frenchman.
She promised to watch Sati after we said goodbye.
Goodbye?
- You' re not staying with her?
- It is not possible.
Our arrangement with the Frenchman was for our daughter only.
- My wife and I must return to our world.
- That is our karma.
- You believe in karma?
Karma is a word, like love.
"What I am here to do."
I do not resent my karma.
Grateful for my wonderful wife, for my beautiful daughter.
They are gifts, and so I do what I must do to honor them.
- Papa, the train!
Find your bag.
Quickly.
Can I carry that for you?
All right.
Hurry it up, I' m late!
- Who are you?
- He is a friend.
I know you.
- So that' s what they wanted.
- I need to get back.
I' il pay you whatever you want.
One way or another, I' m getting on this train.
Oh, no, no, no.
You' il stay here until the Merovingian says different.
If I know him...... you' re gonna be here for a long, long time.
- I don' t want to hurt you.
I built this place.
Down here, I make the rules.
Down here, I make the threats.
Down here, I' m God.
Get on the train or you' il stay here with him.
We should return to the Oracle.
She will know what to do.
No.
We know what has to be done.
Shit.
You gotta be kidding.
Holy shit, it' s wingless.
I get it.
You must be ready to die.
I need to speak with him.
Only way you' re getting through this door is over my big, dead ass.
So be it.
There are no weapons allowed in the club.
At the bottom of this elevator, there is a coat- check girl...... and if we are lucky, one man for checking weapons.
And if we' re unlucky?
There will be many men.
Can I take your --?
What in the hell?
I don' t believe this.
The prodigal child returns.
Are you here for the bounty, Seraph?
Tell me, how many bullets are there in those guns?
I don' t know, but I don' t think you have enough.
- We only want to talk.
- Oh, yes.
You have fought through Hel to do so.
I' il tell you what I will do.
Put down the guns, and I will promise you a safe passage out of here.
- All three of us?
- Oh, yes, yes.
Of course.
Who could have guessed we would see each other so soon after our last meeting?
The Fates are too kind, eh?
And since you, my little Judas, have brought them here...... I can only surmise that the fortuneteller has found herself another shell?
Disappointing, but not unexpected.
I do hope, however, she has the good manners to learn her lesson...... and to remember that there is no action without consequence.
And if you take something from me, you will pay the price.
You know why we are here?
Come now, what kind of question is this?
Of course I know.
It is my business to know.
Some might think this is a strange coincidence, but I do not.
I am curious, though, as to how it actually happened.
- Do you know?
- No.
No?
But it is always best to ask, huh?
We want to make a deal.
Always straight to business, huh, Morpheus?
Okay.
I have something you want.
To make a deal...... you must have something I want, yes?
And it so happens there is something I want.
Something I have wanted ever since I first came here.
It is said they cannot be taken...... they can only be given.
What?
The eyes of the Oracle.
I told you before, there is no escaping the nature of the universe.
It is that nature that has again brought you to me.
Where some see coincidence, I see consequence.
Where others see chance...... I see cost.
Bring me the eyes of the Oracle...... and I will give you back your savior.
It seems a perfectly fair and reasonable deal to me.
Yes?
No?
I don' t have time for this shit.
You wanna make a deal?
You give me Neo, or we all die, right here, right now.
Interesting deal.
You are really ready to die for this man?
- Believe it.
- She' il do it.
If she has to, she' il kill every one of us.
She' s in love.
It is remarkable how similar the pattern of love is to the pattern of insanity.
Time' s up.
What' s it gonna be, Merv?
Okay.
You got yourself in here...... you can get yourself out.
Are you ready for us?
Almost, sir.
They got some pretty ancient hacks here.
- But you found Neo?
- Can' t you see him?
No, sir.
We read something, but I couldn' t tell what.
I can' t leave yet.
I have to see her.
Now?
It' s my last chance.
That' s the secret.
- You' ve got to use your hands.
- Why?
Cookies need love like everything does.
Neo!
I was hoping to have these done before you got here.
Sati, honey, I think it' s time for a tasting.
Take the bowl to Seraph and find out if they' re ready.
Okay.
- I' m glad you got out.
- Me too.
So do you recognize me?
- A part of you.
- Yeah, that' s how it works.
Some bits you lose, some bits you keep.
I don' t yet recognize my face in the mirror...... but I still love candy.
No, thank you.
Remember how you were when you first walked through my door?
Jittery as a June bug.
And now, just look at you.
You sure did surprise me, Neo, and you still do.
You gave me a few surprises too.
I hope I helped.
You helped me to get here, but my question is, why?
Where is this going?
- Where does it end?
- I don' t know.
- You don' t know or you won' t tell me?
- I told you before...... no one can see beyond a choice they don' t understand, and I mean no one.
- What choice?
- It doesn' t matter.
It' s my choice.
I have mine to make, same as you have yours.
Does that include what things to tell me and what not to?
- Of course not.
- Why didn' t you tell me about the Architect?
About Zion and the ones before me?
Why didn' t you tell me the truth?
- Because it wasn' t time for you to know.
- Who decided it wasn' t time?
You know who.
Know Thyself
I did.
Then I think it' s time for me to know a few more things.
So do I.
Tell me how I separated my mind from my body without jacking in.
Tell me how I stopped four sentinels by thinking it.
Tell me just what the hell is happening to me.
The power of the One extends beyond this world.
It reaches from here all the way back to where it came from.
- Where?
That' s what you felt when you touched those sentinels, but you weren' t ready for it.
You should be dead, but apparently you weren' t ready for that either.
The Architect said that if I didn' t return to the source, Zion would be destroyed tonight.
Please.
You and I may not be able to see beyond our own choices...... but that man can' t see past any choice.
- Why not?
- He doesn' t understand them.
He can' t.
To him, they are variables in an equation.
One at a time, each variable must be solved, then countered.
That' s his purpose.
To balance the equation.
What' s your purpose?
To unbalance it.
Why?
What do you want?
I want the same thing you want, Neo.
And I' m willing to go as far as you are to get it.
The end of the war.
Is it going to end?
One way or another.
Can Zion be saved?
If there is an answer, there' s only one place you' re going to find it.
- Where?
- You know where.
And if you can' t find the answer...... then I' m afraid there may be no tomorrow for any of us.
What does that mean?
Everything that has a beginning...... has an end.
I see the end coming.
I see the darkness spreading.
I see death.
And you are all that stands in his way.
Smith.
Very soon, he is going to have the power to destroy this world.
He can' t.
He won' t stop until there' s nothing left at all.
What is he?
He is you.
Your opposite, your negative.
The result of the equation trying to balance itself out.
- And if I can' t stop him?
- One way or another, Neo...... this war is going to end.
Tonight, the future of both worlds will be in your hands...... or in his.
How are you feeling?
Are you all right?
I need time.
- That figures.
- Captain Roland.
- Bane is.
Good.
Maybe he' s got some answers.
I love that smell.
I sure am going to miss it.
- Oracle.
I know.
Sati, honey.
Take a few cookies and go with Seraph.
I would like to come back.
- I would like that too.
- Then I' il see you tomorrow.
I hope so, hon, I hope so.
I' m scared, Seraph.
Come.
He' s following us.
Well, well, it' s been a long time.
I remember chasing you was like chasing a ghost.
I have beaten you before.
Yes, true, but as you can see, things are a little different now.
And you must be the last exile.
- The Oracle told me about you.
- Really?
What did she say about me?
That you were a bad man.
Oh, I' m not so bad, once you get to know me.
The great and powerful Oracle, we meet at last.
I suppose you' ve been expecting me, right?
The all- knowing Oracle is never surprised.
She knows everything.
But if that' s true, then why is she here if she knew I was coming?
Why wouldn' t she leave?
Maybe you knew I would do that, maybe you didn' t.
If you did, that means you baked those cookies and set that plate there...... deliberately, purposefully...... which means that you' re sitting there also deliberately, purposefully.
What did you do with Sati?
"Cookies need love like everything does."
You are a bastard.
You would know, Mom.
Do what you' re here to do.
Yes, ma' am.
I really wish I could help, but I just....
I don' t remember any of it.
What about the cuts on your arms?
Those cuts are more than one day old.
Yeah, definitely.
You' re right about that, sir.
They look like they might be self- inflicted.
But why would I do something like that to myself?
Unless, of course, I wasn' t myself.
But if I' m not me, then who am I?
- Has this man been tested for VDTs?
It was negative.
But he is showing a lot of unusual neural activity.
Some cross- synaptic firing, as well as signs of recent trauma...... with fresh fibrotic scarring throughout the cortex.
I want the truth.
Make him remember.
Sir, we found her.
{Y: i} - The Logos</ i>?
About time we had some goddamn good news.
Are the thermals picking up any signs of life?
Nothing yet.
- What about the ship?
- Holographic says the hull' s still intact.
- Drop down and keep a man in the turret.
- Yes, sir.
Get a full diagnostic on that ship as fast as humanly possible.
The squids are sneaky bastards.
It could be a trap.
What was that?
All she needs is a jump.
- Niobe.
- Morpheus.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I' m fine.
We didn' t know what happened after....
- I' m sorry.
- It' s okay.
I' m happy to see you too.
- Did you get Neo out?
- How did you know about that?
- The Oracle.
- You saw her?
- Just before the sentinels found us.
- What did she tell you?
- The same thing she always does.
Exactly what I needed to hear.
In 12 hours, the machines will breach the dock walls.
Every simulation we' ve run, we' ve seen that once the machines are inside the city...... the odds of our survival decrease dramatically.
Thus, our primary objective must be...... to destroy or disable the diggers inside the dock.
If we can do that, perhaps we can prevent them from ever reaching the city.
If not, the only place we will be able to mount a defense...... will be at the entrance of the temple.
It is small and will force them into a bottleneck...... allowing us to concentrate the remainder of our defense.
We understand that you' ve requested additional volunteers.
That is correct.
Precisely what size force are you planning to commit to the primary dock objective?
Right now, the entire APU Corps and half the infantry.
- Half the infantry?
- lf it were up to me, councillor...... I' d take every man, woman and child, put a gun in their hand...... and march them into that dock.
Perhaps it is best that it is not up to you.
Time will tell, councillor.
Commander, just one more question.
{Y: i} Has there been word from the Nebuchadnezzar</ i>?
None, and at this point there' s no reason to expect there will be.
Perhaps.
But we can hope.
I' m afraid hope is an indulgence I don' t have time for.
- Zee, what are you doing?
- Making shells.
They' re evacuating our level.
- I' m not going with you.
- What?
They' ve called for volunteers to hold the dock.
Kids, you stay here.
- I have to.
- Why?
Because I love him.
I love him the same as he loves me.
And if I were out there and he were here, I know what he' d do.
But you' re gonna get yourself killed.
It' s crazy, Zee.
Maybe it is.
But ask yourself, if it were Dozer...... and you knew the only chance you had to see him was to hold the dock...... what would you do?
Make shells.
What the shit is going on over here?
An accident, sir.
- I' m sorry.
- Who the hell are you?
A unit volunteer, sir.
What' s a pod- born pencil- neck like you doing volunteering for my Corps?
I want to do my part, sir.
We gotta hold the dock.
- How old are you, kid?
Should have said 16, I might have believed that.
Okay, I' m 16.
Minimum age for the Corps is 18.
The machines don' t care how old I am.
They' il kill me just the same.
Ain' t that the goddamn truth.
Give me a chance, sir.
I won' t let you down.
You do, and you' il find me and the machines have got something in common.
Okay, charge the igniter.
She lives again.
Yeah.
Could you clean the windshield while you' re at it?
I' m bringing her back online.
Looking good, except....
Something' s wrong with the Matrix feed.
No, there' s not.
You' re looking at what we' re looking at.
{Y: i} - What' s going on in there? </ i>
- Whatever it is, it can' t be good.
The machines have taken Junction 21.
The way I see it, if we drop down from broadcast here...... intersect 153, we might surprise them.
We' il go first, hammer as deep as we can, then blow our EMP.
Hopefully we can punch a hole big enough for you to get through.
It ain' t pretty, but the way I see it, it' s the only way back.
No, it' s not.
There' s another way.
A support line.
It drops down right here, 1000 meters short of 21.
If we' re lucky, we may be able to slip down without them ever knowing.
That' s a mechanical line.
- No one can pilot a mechanical.
- I can.
- Bullshit.
- I' ve done it.
- That was a long time ago, Niobe.
- I said I can do it.
So what?
There' s no way we can follow you.
Hi.
I know time is always against us.
I' m sorry that I took so long.
- But I wanted to be sure.
- Sure of what?
- What?
There' s no easy way to say this, so I' il just say it.
- I have to take one of the ships.
- What?
To go where?
To the machine city.
No, it' s not.
You' re out of your goddamn mind.
I still have to go.
In 100 years, no ship has been within 100 kilometers of it.
- You' il never make it.
- I have to try.
- Is this what the Oracle has told you?
This is asinine.
If you want to kill yourself, do it...... but do it without wasting our ships.
I have to go.
- Bullshit!
I say where it has to go!
And this ship will go to hell long before I let you take it anywhere.
- He can take mine.
- You can' t do that.
Don' t try to tell me what I can or cannot do...... with my ship after that little speech.
- But for chrissake, Niobe -- - I' il pilot this ship, he can take mine.
If we leave inside the hour, we should reach Zion as the machines do.
That' s as good a plan as any.
It' s a waste.
A goddamn waste.
Two ships, two directions.
Sounds like providence, doesn' t it, Morpheus?
- You' ve never believed in the One.
- I still don' t.
Then why are you doing this?
I believe in him.
Thank you.
- What' s that for?
- To help you relax.
To make it easier for you to remember.
What if I don' t want to remember?
Why would you want that?
What if I blew that EMP?
What if I did destroy those ships...... and I am responsible for the deaths of all those men?
If I did that...... it wouldn' t be very safe for me here, would it?
Of course, it might not be very safe for you either.
I' m ready.
Trinity...... there' s something I have to say.
Something you need to understand.
I know I' m supposed to go.
But beyond that...... I don' t know.
You don' t think you' re coming back.
I knew it the moment you said you had to leave.
I could see it in your face.
Just like you knew the moment you looked at me that I was coming with you.
I' m scared, Trin.
So am I.
It took me 10 minutes to buckle up one boot.
But I' il tell you something.
Six hours ago, I told the Merovingian...... I was ready to give anything and everything for you.
Do you know what' s changed in the last six hours?
No.
Nothing.
{Y: i} - Finished loading ammunition? </ i>
We are out of time.
You' re not leaving them anything?
He said he didn' t need it.
I' m saying good luck.
Thank you.
I can only hope you know what you' re doing.
Me too.
It was an honor, sir.
No, the honor is still mine.
{Y: i} - We' re read, sir. </ i>
- About damn time.
We' re already late, captain, so let' s hit it and hit it hard.
Take good care of them.
Ready?
Engine' s still firing.
I' il check it out.
- I should' ve known he' d send his bitch first.
No one ever got away from me as many times as you did.
Every time, I thought it was the last.
Every time, I was sure we had you, but you' d slip through our fingers.
I really can' t express just how aggravating that can be.
What are you talking about?
I think I might enjoy killing you as much as killing him.
He' s psychotic!
You' re gonna pay for that.
{Y: i} - Twenty- seven kilometers to go.
- We got an emergenc. </ i>
{Y: i} - What is it, AK?
- It' s Maggie, sir. </ i>
{Y: i} She' s dead, murdered. </ i>
I think it was Bane. </ i>
Goddamn it.
I knew he was out of his goddamn mind.
He fired that EMP.
Goddamn it, I should have beaten it out of him.
We searched the whole ship, captain.
He ain' t here.
{Y: i} - I know where he is.
- The Logos</ i>.
- We gotta go back.
- Too late.
- What if they need our help?
- Why?
- Because if he' s killed them...... he' il control another EMP.
At this point, they' re on their own.
Just like us.
Mr. Anderson.
I see you are as predictable in this world as you are in the other.
- What?
- He' s out of his mind.
But Mr. Anderson and I know...... that appearances can be deceiving.
Confused, Mr. Anderson?
It' il all become clear in a moment.
Thank you for bringing me the gun.
You can set it down there.
Don' t do it.
- Shoot.
- Yes, shoot.
Fry us.
Do it.
If you don' t, he' il kill us both.
He knows he should do it, but he won' t.
- He can' t.
Back away from the gun and turn around.
Let her go.
Somehow familiar, isn' t it?
We' ve been here before, you and I, remember?
I do.
I think of nothing else.
- Who are you?
- Still don' t recognize me?
I admit, it is difficult to even think encased in this rotting piece of meat.
The stink of it filling every breath, a suffocating cloud you can' t escape.
Disgusting.
Look at how pathetically fragile it is.
Nothing this weak is meant to survive.
- What do you want?
- I want what you want.
Yes.
That' s it, Mr. Anderson.
Look through the soft gelatin of these dull cow eyes and see your enemy.
- No.
- Oh, yes, Mr. Anderson.
- It can' t be.
There is nowhere I won' t find you.
- It' s impossible.
- Not impossible.
Inevitable.
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.
It' s gotta be.
Oh, no.
I wish you could see yourself, Mr. Anderson.
Blind messiah.
You' re a symbol for all of your kind, Mr. Anderson.
Helpless.
Pathetic.
Just waiting to be put out of your misery.
I can see you.
It' s not over.
- Trinity!
- Neo.
Oh, no.
Your eyes.
I' il be okay.
It' s all right, Trin.
But I think you' re gonna have to drive.
Seismic' s projecting 22 minutes to breach.
They can' t know we don' t have an EMP.
They' il have to attack in waves.
Concentrate our offense on the diggers.
Order the APUs into position.
Yes, sir.
All right!
This is it.
Now, you all know me, so I' il just say this as simple as I can.
If it' s our time to die, it' s our time.
All I ask is, if we have to give these bastards our lives...... we give them hell before we do!
- You scared, Charra?
- Shit, yeah.
But I' il make you a deal.
You keep loading, I keep shooting.
Deal.
- Holy Christ, would you look at that.
- How far to the opening?
- 1. 4 kilometers.
- We' re still generating too hot a field.
- Ghost, kill all auxiliary systems.
Drop down four pads.
- It' il bottom out.
- Easy, baby.
- Seven hundred meters.
If we can just get close enough....
Six hundred meters.
There.
Shit!
- Jig' s up, here they come.
- Give me full power.
Man the gun turrets, every goddamn one of them.
Ghost, you' re the best gunner, go with them.
Morpheus, take his place.
I' m coming, baby.
Here they come.
{Y: i} - Slow down, this ain' t the</ i> Logos.
- Hang on to your lunch, Roland, here we go.
Holy Christ, I didn' t know this ship could do that.
Breach!
The dock is breached!
Knuckle up!
For Zion!
Shit.
Come on, let' s go.
Knuckle up!
Reload!
Reload nine!
Go, go!
Move, move!
Watch your left!
Don' t let them through!
Zuka!
Oh, my God.
Where the hell' s my infantry?
I want that goddamn machine taken down!
Dig this!
Oh, shit!
- Goddamn it!
Shit, she' s got a fat ass.
- Keep them off me!
- Christ, there' s a shitstorm of them.
- You see that?
Stop them!
Damn it!
Grab my belt.
Just give me one clean shot.
Damn it!
- I got incoming!
- We got a dock full of incoming!
But this is different, sir.
- What?
I think it' s one of ours, sir.
- That' s impossible.
- Holographics are trying to confirm.
I want access codes.
There' s no response.
It' s a trick.
That' s not one of ours, it can' t be.
That' s a mechanical line.
No one can pilot mechanical.
- Forward aft, 30 degrees at 80 percent.
- Thirty degrees, 80.
- Sixty degrees.
Come on, keep up!
Do you find me sadistic?
Well, I bet I could fry an egg on your head right now... if I wanted to.
You know kiddo,
I' d like to believe that you' re aware enough even now... to know that there is nothing sadistic in my actions.
Maybe towards those other jokers, but not you.
You know kiddo, this moment, this is me at my most non- sadistic.
Bill, it' s your baby.
Coming.
- Carol, I cannot believe you are early!
Come on.
Mommy, I' m home.
Hey baby.
Mommy, what happened to you and TV room?
Oh, that little dog of yours, got his ass into the living room and acted like a damn pool.
That' s what happened baby.
Barney did this?
Baby, you can' t come in here.
You could cut yourself.
This is an old friend of mommy' s I haven' t seen in a long time.
What' s your name?
Her name is Nikki.
Nikki, such a pretty name for such a pretty girl.
How old are you Nikki?
Nikki,?? (bleep) asked you a question.
I' m four.
Four years old, eh.
You know, I had a little girl once.
She' d be about four now.
I want you to go in your room now and leave us alone till I tell you to come out.
OK?
Nikkia.
In your room, now.
You want some coffee?
Yeah, sure.
This Pasadena' s homemaker' s name is Jeanny Bell.
Her husband is doctor Lawrence Bell.
But back when we were acquainted four years ago, her name was Vernita Green.
Mine, black Mamba.
Can I have a towel?
Yeah.
Still take cream and sugar, right?
Yeah.
I suppose it' s a little late for an apology, huh?
You suppose correctly.
I need to know if you' re going to start any shit around my baby girl.
You can relax for now.
I' m not going to murder you in front of your child, OK?
You need to be more rational because I don' t know what you' re capable of.
It' s mercy, compassion, and forgiveness I lack.
Not rationality.
I know I fucked you over.
I fucked you over bad.
I wish to God I hadn' t, but I did.
You have every right to get even.
Even Steven?
Then wait for your husband the good doctor Bell to come home and kill him.
That would leave us square.
Look, if I could go back in a machine I would, but I can' t.
All I can tell you is that I' m a different person now.
Oh, great.
I don' t care.
Be that as it may, I know I don' t deserve your mercy or your forgiveness.
However, I beseech you for both what happened and for my daughter.
You can stop right there.
Just because I have no wish to murder you before the eyes of your daughter... does not mean that parading her around in front of me is going to inspire sympathy.
You and I have unfinished business.
And not a God damned fucking thing you' ve done in the subsequent 4 years, including getting knocked up, is going to change that.
When do we do this?
It all depends.
Tomorrow?
The day after tomorrow?
How about tonight, bitch?
Splendid.
Where?
There a baseball diamond where I coach a little league about a mile from here.
We meet there around 2: 30 in the morning, dressed all in black, your hair in black stocking, we' il have a knife fight.
You won' t be bothered.
And now, I have to fix Nikki cereal.
Bill always said you were one of the best ladies he ever saw with an edge weapon.
Fuck you bitch.
So you, you can kiss my mother fucking ass just like mamba.
Mamba.
I should have been more like mother fucking mamba.
It' s a weapon of your choice and you can stick with your butcher knife if you want, that' s fine with me.
Very funny bitch.
Very funny.
It' s not my intention to do this in front of you.
For that I' m sorry.
Your mother had it coming.
When you grow up, just don' t feel wrong about it.
I' il be waiting.
Well, give me the gory details on that one.
It' s a God damn massacre, pop.
They wiped out the whole wedding party, execution style.
Give me a figure.
Nine dead bodies.
We' re talking the whole chebang.
Bride, groom, reverend... reverend' s wife.
Hell, they even shot that old colored fellow that played the organ.
Appears to me somebody objected to the union that wasn' t able to hold their piece.
What' d I tell you, pop!
Like a God damn Nicaraguan death squad.
This is a shit can mess of war in the house of the lord.
Sorry pop.
My guesstimate it' s a lumber hit squad.
Four, maybe five strong.
How can you tell?
Well it' s sure a steady hand did this.
It ain' t no squirrelly amateur.
This was the work of a salty dog.
You can tell by the cleanliness of the carving that killed crazy ram pig, though it may be, though cut a fine line.
If he wasn' t a moron, he' d almost get a merit.
Who' s the bride?
Don' t know.
That' s a fake.
We' ve always been calling her the bride on account of her dress.
You can tell if she' s pregnant.
The man had to be a mad dog to kill a damned good looking gal like that in the head.
Look at her.
A colored hair, big eyes.
She' s a blood splattered angel.
- Son number one...
- Yeah.
The cock sucker ain' t dead.
I might never have liked you.
Quite in fact, I despise you.
But this shouldn' t suggest I don' t respect you.
Dying in our sleep is a luxury that are kinda rarely afforded.
My gift... to you.
Hello Bill.
What' s her condition?
Comatose.
Where is she?
I' m standing over her right now.
That' s my girl.
Elle, you' re going to abort the mission.
We owe her better than that.
No, you don' t owe her shit.
Will you keep your voice down?
You don' t owe her shit.
May I say one thing.
Speak.
You all beat the hell out of that woman, but you didn' t kill her.
You put a bullet in her head but her heart just kept on beating.
Did you not?
We' ve done a lot of things to this lady.
And if she wakes up, we' il do a whole lot more.
But one thing we won' t do is sneak into her room in the night,
like a filthy rat and kill her in her sleep.
And the reason we won' t do that thing is because that thing would lower us.
Don' t you agree Miss Driver?
Do you really have to guess?
I know.
Come on home, honey.
Affirmative.
I love you very much.
I love you too.
Bye- Bye.
You thought that was pretty fucking funny, didn' t you?
Don' t you ever wake up.
At this moment, this is me, in my most sadistic moment.
Bill, it' s your...
The price is 35 dollars a fuck, my friend.
Think you can get the freak on or what?
Oh yeah boy.
Now here' s the rules.
Rule number one, don' t punch her.
The nurse comes in tomorrow and she' s got a shiner or some less teeth, the jig' s up.
No knuckle sandwiches under no circumstances.
And by the way, this little cunt' s a spirit, it' s a motor reflex thing.
Spirit or no, no punching.
Now are we absolutely positively clear on rule number one?
Good.
No monkey bites or hickeys.
In fact, don' t leave no marks of no kind.
After that, it' s all good, buddy.
There' s no one down at work till tomorrow, so feel free to come back all you want.
Keep the noise down and try not to make a mess.
I' il be back in twenty.
Oh shit.
By the way, not all the times, but sometimes this chick' s cooch can be as dry as a bucket of sand.
If she' s dry, lube up with this and you' il be good to go.
Don' t ask to keep it buddy.
You are the best looking girl I' ve had today.
Yo, stud, time' s up buddy.
Coming in, ready or not.
Hey buddy, did you have yourself a good time?
Where' s Bill?
Please stop hitting me.
I don' t know who Bill is.
Bull shit.
She' s a real slice of cutie pie they say, you know.
Jane Doe.
They don' t know shit about you.
My name' s Buck, and I' m here to fuck.
Your name' s Buck, right?
Right?
Wiggle your big toe.
I could see the faces of cunts who did this to me.
And the dick responsible.
Members all of the Deadly Vipers Assassination Squad.
When fortune smiles on something as violent and ugly as revenge, it seems proof like no other that not only does God exist, you' re doing his will.
At a time when I knew the least about my enemies, the first name on my death list,
O- Ren Ishii was easiest to find.
But of course when one manages the difficult task of becoming queen of the Tokyo underworld, one doesn' t keep it a secret, does one?
O- Ren Ishii was born on an American military base in Tokyo, Japan.
The half Japanese, half Chinese American army brat made her first acquaintance with death at the age of nine.
It was at that age that she witnessed the death of her parents at the hands of Japan' s most ruthless Yakuza boss, Boss Matsumoto.
She swore revenge.
Lucky for her, Boss Matsumoto was a pedophile.
At eleven, she got her revenge.
Take a good look at my face.
Look at my eyes.
Look at my mouth.
Do I look familiar?
You murdered!
By twenty she was one of the top female assassins in the world.
At twenty- five she did her part in the killing of nine innocent people, including my unborn daughter, in a small wedding chapel in El Paso, Texas.
But on that day, four years ago, she made one big mistake.
She should have killed ten.
However, before satisfaction be mine,
First thing first, wiggle your big toe.
Hard part' s over.
Now, let' s get these other piggies wiggling.
Welcome to Arrow.
May I help you?
Okinawa... One way.
Hi.
Welcome.
You English?
Almost... American.
American.
Welcome then.
My English... very good.
You said domo, very good, can you speak Japanese?
Just a few words I learned since yesterday.
Um, may I sit at the bar?
Oh sure sure, please, sit.
What other words did you learn?
Oh, excuse me.
Shut up, get your ass out here.
You' il excuse me.
Oh, let' s see.
Arigato.
Arigato... mm
Yeah.
Oh yea yea yea.
Konijiwa.
Konichiwa.
Ah, that' s good.
- Now you' re making fun of me.
- No no no.
See, serious business.
Pronunciation very good.
You say arigato, like we say arigato.
Well thank you.
I mean, arigato.
No kidding.
I heard it was kind of hard.
Most of the them, but you have a Japanese tongue.
OK OK omachikasama.
Oh my God,
I beg your pardon?
Drink.
Oh yes, um, a bottle of warm sake please.
Do you understand?
Do you understand me?
Sorry.
Uh huh.
What brings you to Okinawa?
I came to see a man.
Oh yeah.
You have a friend that you are in love?
Not quite.
A friend?
I never met him.
Never?
May I ask?
Hattori Hanzo.
You must have big rats if you need Hattori Hanzo steel.
Huge.
May I?
Wait.
Try the second one from the top.
You like a samurai sword, I like baseball.
I wanted to show you these.
I no longer make instruments of death.
I keep for their aesthetic and sentimental value.
Yet, proud as I am of my life' s work.
I have retired.
Then give me one of these.
These are not for sale.
I didn' t say sell me.
I said give me.
Why... should I give you?
Because my vermin is a former student of yours.
And considering the student, I' d say you have a rather large obligation.
You can sleep here.
It was one year after the massacre in El Paso, Texas, the Bill backed his Nippon progeny financially and philosophically in her Shakespearian- in- magnitude power struggle with the other Yakuza clans over who would rule vice in the city of Tokyo.
When the final sword...
The future... has not been written.
There is no fate for what we make us for ourselves.
I wish I could believe that.
My name is John Connor.
They tried to murder me, before I was born.
When I was 13, they tried again.
Terminators...
Judgement Day.
The beginning of war between men and machines.
I would lead the war with the rest of human race and alternate victory.
It hasn' t happended.
No bombs fell.
Computers didn' t take control...
We stopped Judgement Day.
But, I don' t.
No address...
No one... and nothing can find me.
I can' t erase my dreams.
I feel the weight of the future bearing down on me.
So, I keep running.
As fast as I can...
Nowhere...
Oh my god!
Are you OK?
Show me call you 911?
I like this car.
Wait!

He' s... really... not... human...
I know what is like to be a hostage situation.
I' ve been myself.
The adrenalin...
You' il find yourself imagining things. impossible things...
Crazy things..
Insane things...
It take years to go.
Go!
Drop your weapon!
And, the coffine!
Get hime down!
ROUNDS FlRED... 250 VEHlCLES DESTROYED... 004
HUMAN CASUALlTIES... 000
Resume fire!
We must require Catherine Brewster.
What makes her so sure god damn important?
Through him... we contact to GunMan of U. S. Military... and, learn how to fight SkyNet. and cooperate with Resistance.
Later, your children will be coming importance.
What?
- She' s your wife.
Get in.
You wanna leave?
It were Scott!
Your fiance?
The T- X is foamlaredic... able to detect a form of anything he touches.
Your fiance is dead.
Oh my god!
Do... something!
Get down!
We need a new vehicle.
PRlMARY WEAPON DAMAGED
SEEKlNG REPLACEMENT
Hey!
We' ve gotta keep moving.
She killed Scott, because of me...
Sometimes, things happen or we can take changes.
It' s not your fault.
Sure about this?
For her and I mean...
Your confusion is unaddressional.
She is a healthy female and a breeding ages.
Take these or more... to it or not?
My database has nothing composed of Dynamics of Human Fear Banding.
Terminatrix... how many others does she have in her list?
22!
Anderson Elizabeth.
Brewster Robert.
My father?
TX will resume his T4 program.
She' s gonna kill my father, too?
This is a high properliaty.
No!
Who is he?
What does he do?
Weapon Design...
I don' t know it exactly...
General Robert Brewster is the program director of C. R. S.
Cyber Research Systems...
A Dyna Weapons Decison.
SkyNet
You' re talking about SkyNet, Aren' t you?
SkyNet is the one of the Digital Defence Systems develped by Brewster' s supervision.
God!
Oh... my God!
Of course!
My sense now...
Everything hadn' t changed...
She and I will have to got together, then...
I...
I don' t understand that...
This is all about your father.
He always was...
Your father is one who can shut SkyNet down.
You see only one who ever could.
We have to get to him further T- X does.
I can' t drop on my mission.
To save people!
My mission is to ensure the survival of John Connor and Catherine Brewster.
I' m giving you an order!
I' m not programmed to follow your orders!
After the nuclear war, we have to leave.
- Nuclear war?
- That doesn' t have to be a war!
We can stop it!
It' s an insufficient time.
The first launch sequences will be initiated at 6: 18 PM.
What...
Today?
- Affirmative!
- John, What is he saying?
It' s today... 3 hours from now.
2 Hours and 53 Minutes.
Escape to the primary plascell' s zone.
But, we have to get to her dad.
The Mohalli area was sustained its significant nuclear fallout.
You will not survive.
You mean... we may just go run and hide somewhere in a hole or other... bombs fall?
It is your destiny.
- Fuck my destiny.
- John!
You can not self terminate.
You can' t.
I can do whatever the hell I wanna do.
I' m not the god damn robot.
- Cyborgnetic organism - Whatever!
Either, we go to her father...
Or... so much for the great John Connor.
I don' t want any part of it.
Based to your pupil dialation... skin temperature, motor functions... are calculated 83% properbility... did you will not trigger.
Please do it as he said!
You have to save my father!
We can reach CRS in approximately 1 hour... depending on traffic conditions.
I can' t get on- line.
The whole works are down.
SkyNet is summoning control of global communications and prepration for its attack.
So... this war is between people and machines...?
Why are you on our side?
The Resistance captured me. and reprogrammed my CPU.
I was originally designed for assasination missions.
You don' t really care for this mission successes or not.
If we get killed... does that mean anything to you?
If you would die...
I' il become useless.... don' t be no reason for me to exist.
Thank you for doing this.
I' m programmed to follow your commands.
Her commands?
It was Catherine Brewster who had reactivated me and sent through time and space field.
What is exactly am I in the future of yours?
You' re John Connor' s spouse and second in Command.
No!
What?
You' re a mass!
Yeah! you' re not exactly my type, either.
So, why didn' t I send you back?
I' m not authorized to answer your question.
Why didn' t he send you back?
He was dead.
It well sucks...
Humans inevitably die.
Yeah...
No... maybe I...
How does he die?
John Conner was terminated at July, 4th, 2032.
I was selected for the emotional touchment he develped his modern number to do these boys of experiences.
What are you saying?
I killed you.
They were!
Only survailant sectors were infected.
That' s all everything.
Then, a few minutes ago, we' ve got the guidance computer bannable crash.
But, not it looks like a virus.
- What?
- Signal from hampers and satellite was scrambled and beyond ignitions.
What about the Missile silos and subs?
We lost contacts.
Do you got...
Did you say this is completely open to attack?
Theoretically, we can be under attack already.
Who' s doing this?
Some power or some computer hackering garage...
We can' t trace a virus and we can' t pan it down.
Some... somebody he is we' ve never seen before It keeps growing and changing.
And, It' s like an mind of its own.
This can' t be happening.
Sir! the Pentagon is on the secure line.
Right.
None is gonna happen.
Bomb won' t fall.
You won' t have to kill me someday... will never gonna exist...
You and I become... go to the separate ways.
How' s first on my first kissed guy.
Really?
You' il never be good... if relief intention in the fear of death.
Brewser!
Well... what' s the hell you got the kind of solution for this?
But, SkyNet is not ready for this system wide connection.
That sounds a discovery on a kind of approximity over there which they just told me.
They say we didn' t stop this stand by the virus.
But, your boys are saying we will plug the SkyNet into all my systems.
Mr. Chairman!
If we are uplink now, SkyNet will control your military.
But, you' re in good at control of SkyNet!
That is correct, Sir!
If your thing works... you' il get over fundings you ever need.
Yes, Sir!
EXECUTE Y/ N? _
Sir?
Shall we?
No.
It' s my job, now.
We are in!
Passed the firewalls and local defence net in a minimum subs.
SkyNet is holding up Rational Processing at 60 TerraBlop per sec.
Must pretty god this works.
SKYNET DEFENCE SYSTEM NOW ACTlVATED.
Power failure?
No.
Tony, What the hell is going now?
Daddy!
What are you doing here?
Get away from him!
Watch out!
Daddy!...
Don' t move!
She' il be back!
We should shut down Skynet!
Where is the system core?
Somewhere in this building?
The virus has defected SkyNet.
SkyNet is the virus!
It' s the reason everything' s falling apart!
In 1 hour, it will initiate a massive nuclear attack on this enemy.
What enemy?
Humans!
This machine' s started to take over.
My office... on this for us we do...
The access codes are in my safe.
Why are they killing everyone?
It destroyes any possible threat to SkyNet.
Which one is the code?
Red in the half!
Crystal Pea...
You have to get to Crystal Peak!
What?
What was he saying?
Crystal Peak!
52 miles north to east appearing 0. 5 degrees.
That' s the system core?
You need a plane.
A port of survaillable reach to the wrong way.
Take care of my daughter.
Oh... kitty my daughter...
I' m sorry...
I opened Pandora' s box...
Daddy!
Get down!
No!
This is not what you can do.
It is not safe here!
We have to go.
He wanted you to come with me.
Come on!
Run!
Let' s go!
That' s it!
We' il have to follow it to the run way.
Come on!
What?
Nothing!
You remind me of my mother.
She' s coming.
What are you doing?
Powering up.
Come on!
MAGNETlC FlELD ACTlVATE
It' s working.
You bitch!
Come on!
There is my father' s plane.
I' ve tried flying!
He made it.
Get away from me!
Now!
Let' s go, John!
- The mass is on!
Let' s go!
Please You can' t do this one.
I have no choice.
The T- X... has corrupted my system.
You said you so...
Let him go!
You' re fighting right now.
But,... I can' t control the other functions.
You don' t have to do this.
You don' t wanna do this.
This era... is irrelvant.
I' m a machine.
What is your mission?
Ensure of survival of John Connor and Catherine Brewster.
You' re about to fail... that mission.
I can...
You know what you have to do...
You know my destiny!
I have to live...
Are you OK?
What happened?
He couldn' t do it.
He shut himself down.
Can you fly?
015 degrees.
52 mile. about Aerial speed is 160.
You' ve got 32 minutes.
It' s just you and me, now.
John, What if we can' t stop it?
That' s enough C- 4 here to take our 10 super computers.
You' ve gotta make it, Kate!
The future is up to us!
That' s gonna be it!
> RESTART
There will be more of them.
Come on!
It' s a some kind of blast store.
Three is no way that we can go to this thing.
Look!
B
It' s the code' s log.
Type in.
Dacoda 775
POWER ON
We' ve got all of this thing!
Put it in!
Move!
I' m back.
Now!
- Thank you.
Go!
Come on!
You' re terminated!
The elevator!
I' ve set the ignator 5 minutes.
That' s we get some of time we' ve make be about to go.
What is this place?
This computer' s 30 years old.
This is SkyNet?
This nothing here!
This is a fallout shelter for the VlPs.
Only did they get no warning!
This nothing here!
Why didn' t he tell us?
Why did he lead us down here?
To live...
That was his mission.
That was not any way stopping it.
We could just... let it go.
Hello?
Somebody hear me?
This is Montana Civil Defence!
- Hello?
- Anybody reading me?
- We are under attck - CQ?
Is anybody there?
Connor?
What the hell is happening?
Who' s in charge of there?
I am.
Connor, can you help us?
This is Montana Civil Defence.
By the time SkyNet became self weird, it has spreaded into millions of computer' s servers across the planet ordinary computers in office buildings..., dorm rooms... everywhere...
There was no system core.
It could not be shut down.
Judgement Day
The day the human race has been really destoyed by the weapons they' d protect himself.
Because, we knew it we will survival it.
Together...
The terminator knew it.
He tried to tell us.
But, I didn' t want to hear it.
I don' t know.
All I know is what the Terminator taught me.
Never to stop fighting.
And, I never will.
Battle was... just began.
There have been two teams...
Fighting for championship on all circuits in the world:
the "Vaillants" and... "the leader" the leader, No. 13!
Michel Vaillant...
It' s a incredible fight!
70th Le Mans 24 hours race
Michel Vaillant attacks!
Collision!
Another fierce collision between the two cars!
Michel!
Michel is in the flames!
What happened, dear Calm down, it will be alright!
Michel is healthy and well.
Just like the real thing...
Every time you have unpleasant dream, actually nothing happened

How can I be any more humble?
I like my best friends winner' s pure humility!
You will see how humble I could be.
Are you a female wheel?

Michel, stop playing with your cousin Listen to me!
Thanks for your coming!
This is important for me For I have 2 things I want to share with you.
I also have the great news!
The Good is that Peugeot called me today... and their famous motor "Evolution 5" is ready and has been promised to us!
When shall we get them?
It should be in May, but he is operational against half June I. e.... for Le Mans!
The 70th Le Mans 24 hours race!
That' s good news, what' s the great news?
The great news is for David.
You get a steering wheel for Italy,
If you perform well, with Michel as a team for Le Mans
This is incredible!
Henri!
This is real the most wonderful day of my life!
I swear I didn' t know about this, mom.
What' s difference?
Look it is not really the first time that we are gonna take in Le Mans.
But it is well the first time that I dream so terribly
13.
Mom, bless me!
For David, it' s a big day
Julie, I wish you were there!
YOu will be so proud of me!
What?
The weather?
And I am happiest man!
What if I take a photograph of them!
You were not even born, Natasha!
I know that?
Le Mans in memory of 70th...
Let me introduce to you the latest car nations have known for more than 20 years
"No. 13" is the most expected team
And they have Le Mans selected for their large return.
I have it naturally over the team Of "the leader"!
Left us 5 years ago
She leads her team Malaca
Many of you know my father, how stubborn he was
Winning means everything for him.
Be ensured, I am my father' s daughter!
Don' t worry
Really worry about it!
Don' t be afraid of your mom' s nightmare
How is that?
I hope that the young lady is more honest than her father is.
Calm down!
I' m quite calm!
I have things to do!
Dad, please!
And then now, as we do in every year, we will proceed to auctions as the social works of Le Mans.
A. 4, 000 Euros for the gloves of Alain Prost.
4, 000, twice.
Nobody?... 4, 000, third...
Awarded to the young lady!
And then now a quite fine piece of the helmet of Juan Manuel Fangio
Five world champions winner.
An exceptional piece. first bid is at 5, 000 Euros.
5, 000 Euros?
Cheek!
10000!
11000, Michel Vaillant... 12000 12000 13000 13000 once... 14000 once 14000 twice, 15000

30000
No regret?
Are you sure?
Cheek!
43.
The famous Michel Vaillant
Le Mans is not begun yet And you' re already losing.
Not a good sign, is it
I had never thought that your helmet of Fangio deserves the amount!
It was a good affair.
Really great
Actually
It' s your helmet?
Yes, that' s what we call "unexpexted"
Who is she?
A "nightmare"
What are you doing totally in the dark?
Where is No. 13?
For 30 years
I have never talked about the affairs
Please don' t go through with it!
It' s impossible
Being a champion has nothing to do with the nightmare
I can' t do that
David who used to be as fast as a rabit
Now becomes a tortoise
120!
Right!
Turn right!
What' s the matter?
No!
80!
Turn! full gas!
Straight ahead!
320!
Left!

Why doesn' t it run?
100! left!
380!
Bridge!
David, don' t do like a idiot!
Override him!
Bridge!
150!
Danger!
Bridge!
Bridge!
Stop!
You are cought!
David!
Are you ok!
Damn!
Can' t go out!
Ok!
We' re not gonna let Cramer take it!
Go, hurry up!
Tell Michel to "catch up with them"!
You are alright?
Good
That is Giulio!
Vehicle is damaged!
How about David?
He is intact
Michel!
Michel, stand aside!
Stand aside!
David!
Stand aside!
I' m Michel
I know who you are
Thanks for your coming all these way
You mean a lot to david
Maybe he looks on you as family
He meant a lot to us, too
And Steve Warson.
Father has asked for appologise for not able to being here It' s really a lot to him
We will all be here with you
I' ve heard about Le Mans
That' s his child dream...
time?
1 minute and 24 seconds
And is that good?
Good for the cars
What do you mean by that?
That is the same as 9 light- years.
You must try hard to win
Currently it' s hard to win
Idiot!
Maybe it' s because of the car
We have a contract...
Shut up!
Get out of here!
You could wait for me at office
I am too curious.
David has spoken about it a lot...
Come on
Is that Michel?
No, it' s me
You were a driver?
Hundreds of years ago.
Don' t you miss it?
And I' m the one brakes more slowly than the other...
Is the application still in effect?
Of course, Julia?
I' d like to have my husband' s place.
Now only less than 24 hours remains
Look at this!
Who is that?
Julie Wood
Not bad at all!
She said she want to replace David in Le Mans!
Have you said yes to her?
I' ve already tested 2 persons who can replace David
Why shall we let her in?
Just want her to test
To see her ability is limited
How much?
55 seconds 55 seconds 9
The first result is not bad!
How are you doing?
I pilot her around the track!
Michel here, are you ok?
Fine!
Since don' t know the track very well.
I know that!
Follow me!
Big turn!
Left! right! tempo 5!
Tempo 6!
Along the stone!
Accelerate at the exit!
Your turn!
No problem!
Left 160R!
Go in!
Do it yourself!
Yourself!
What' s the guy doing?
What' s up?
Because if we promise her, she will try her best anyway
Julia wants to race in memory of David that' s not enough
"want to try" is really uncommon
Besides, the stopwatch will give you equal chance.
The job record is 51" 1
Let us assume that they get it within 4 seconds then they really stand a chance to win!
I give wants her 3 seconds as they usually get.
Great!
53" 9!
That is less than 3 sec.
I understand
So?
It is not too good
But, you and your brother have an agreement on...
Look, no favors ok.
If I' m not good enough, just tell me!
Your results is less than 3 seconds
Really?
I' m sure This is for you
Welcome to the team Vaillants!
Thanks!
Well done!
Thank you!
Stop!
Drawer Jonquie?
Yes, all 3 generations live here
And around this house I rode my first car.
How old was you then?
6
Stop!
Stop! can' t you hear!
Michel, do something!
Be right back!
Uncle Michel!
Quite good, Laura!
You must look ahead when you drive the car
Stop!
Brake
Good!
And stop at the gate.
But I can' t reach the pedals
Ok, turn left slowly
At the gate, stop at the driveway
Brake slowly
Great!
You are great, Laura.
Henri Vaillant, the grandfather of the child who commands me
Before learning to drive I want you to learn to obey!
I can drive already
Then then only thing you need to learn is to obey!
The insurance company understands but don' t know what causes the explosion
We have carry the wreck here to let Jos have a look
Jos, what do you think?
Proteus crystals.
Which let the vehicle lose control
Basically there is no danger if it' s in the gasonline tank
Only when the vehicle runs in the match, the crystal reach the electric circuits
Then.... Bang
So how does this crystal get in his gasoline tank?
I don' t know
Who put it?
This id Gabrielle Steve, this is you
This is Giulio
That imprint is the mark
If it' s downwind, 85 meters is too short
So he go straight ahead
And where are you?
Here
You see the forest?
This time of the year there are many falling leaves and keep the air cool.
The temperature is thus lower here, the air is more density
So it' s easy to brake
Zig and Zag?
So it does
Then what about other circuits?
It' s from ancestors'... wisdom
How is the currently tyre imprint?
Good
Le Mans will start tomorrow What do we need now?
Hamburgers!
My treat
What do you say?
Great!
Let' s go!
Go!
Taste like my hometown...
Turn right at the 6th crossing Straight 200 sign, then turn left
You' ve been in the curcuit for over one hundred times You should know it well
Sturdy right, in 2.
Brake softly, turn left
Rush
Yes! understand!
I know it by heart!
That means with the eyes closed.
It' s impossible.
Why must you say that?
Where is he going?
Just follow him
Where to go?
Cover my eyes with your hands
Are you sure?
Ready?
Go
Sign!
Michel!
Sign!
Slow down!
Alright!
Watch out!
Sign!
Brake... Sign!
Sign!
Are you okay!
Goodbye
What' s up?
Don' t go to Le Mans
Sorry, dear
I hope my worry is wrong
I hope you are safe
Damn!
No signal!
Welcome to the qualify run for the 70th anniversary of 24 hours of Le Mans
"The leader" returns to the match
It is indeed their first participation since...... The passing on of Gentleman Cheek.
We are expecting the their duel with the Vaillantes
I' ve just been told that the Vaillantes is not ready yet
Hopefully it goes well
Jos has not called me.
Why didn' t they carry it yesterday?
Afraid of being breaking
That' s Jos' s judgement
Really strange!
The vehicle is sent 3 hours ago
Where is Jos' s handphone?
It will be 2 hours 5 minutes later
If the vehicle is not around in one hour it is disqualified for the race!
We can get contact with them
Jos!
Speak louder!
What?
Where?
Where!
We got 18 minutes for 60 kilo!
2 cars come together
The circuit!
You have yet 15 minutes
They are coming
Yes
If you let her in via the Porsche- curve Can they yet make a launched round
I can' t imagine a Le Mans race without Vaillants
Give them a chance
Open the 8th gate!
They must run a round in allowed time!
15 minutes left or they are disqualitified
It' s emergency, the helicopter will pay you
Does helicopter also need fuel?
I doubt it
54 "!
From gate 8!
Faster!
That' s on time!
They are qualified!
Vaillants
Find another way
It' s 10pm
It' s the beginning of the night performance.
Time is 2 hours
Tyre...
That' s alright
What happened this afternoon?
Yes, how is it?
Just take photos, don' t ask question!
Want to replace Gabrielle Spangenberg
Changing driver for the No.
Julie...
Now ¡°Laura¡ ± 's Schneid...
It' s yours?
Don' t leave your dog running around
Seems at the time of changing tyre
It' s possible that someone destructs
Where is the vehicle?
"The leader" doesn' t show up yet
But Cramer wasn' t there.
Where is the truck?
It' s not my fault
That' s it for tonight.
Good night, see you tomorrow
Seems I come at right time.
What' s up?
I come to appologize for her
Really kind
She would do anything for me!
Do you know about me?
Who is for you?
Thank you!
I look on that as a compliment.
What can I do to make it up?
Michel!
The setting you mentioned...
Good evening, Mr. Vaillant!
Soory, I wanted to talk to you last night.
I must falling asleep
Me too...
Excuse me
Calm down, Speak slowly
Disappeared?
Oh, no, mom...
He slept next to the door
He was tired...
He will call you as soon as he is awake
I love you, too, bye!
Is something wrong?
Where is my father?
Good morning!
Answer me in 10 seconds!
Threats?
Michel, you insult me!
But if you don' t believe me...
Now, to answer your question
Yes, I do know where your father is
He is very well
He dies
You win Le Mans, he dies
You don' t race, he dies
The only way you see your father live again is you race and lose
I want you to know what' s humiliation what' s loss
Good morning, welcome to the 24 hours of Le Mans
Bravo at the early birds.
It will be quite a long day today
I' m really sorry, Michel
I relaxed... and drank a cup or two, so...
Are you angry?
Last night, Ruth kidnap my father
You are her witness of not being there
She asked me to race and lose That' s the deal...
I' m gonna have a word with this bitch!
We are talking about my father' s life!
Lose "The leader" in purpose, is it ok?
Don' t do that!
We have no choice, catch the time!
Time to think
As soon as we have the solution We come in action!
You may count on me.
Michel
I want to say thank you for David and for me as well
See you later
The green flag waved...
The cars startup then... for a complete round in the order...
That they acquired during the qualified positions.... and then the 70th 24 hourse of Le Mans begins!
We are going to watch a fierce battle!
Vaillants doesn' t attack
Seems there is a problem
Keep eyes on the situations!
We really try our best from the first rounds?
I wish I knew
Michel, is there any problem?
Everything is cool.
So what' s up with the hero?
Okay. stand aside!
It' s strange!
It' s rare
It' s rare that 2 cars put on their seeds at the same moment
What' s happened?
I hit bricks on the track
Cooperate with each other
Change tyre!
Change tyre!
Vaillants is still in the seed
When would you change the tyre?
Move the tyre in it!
Cramer leaves the seed...
Oddly enough Michel Vaillant makes no use of this advantage.
We let him win seconds and he forfeits it
Wait for me outside!
How do you like the show?
I know you love your son
Why do you do that?
For my father
I watch him suffer the whole life because of you
As a child, I suffered from seeing my father like that
Now Michel and you will precisely feel what we have felt for years
For your childhood, I' m sorry
He always a cheater.
And I think you are more despicable than he is
Don' t be your father, just be be yourself!
Let me go home, I' il forget those unhappy things
Impossible!
Why do you stay behind "the leader"?
Of course not.
It is a long race.
That' s ok
Michel, you owe me an explanation...
What' s the earth going on there?
Everything ok?
So what do we do?
Send Julie to come here
What' s up?
Don' t ask anything!
What does it mean?
I want you to take my place!
Take you place?
What for!
Take your place?
One hour is enough only Jean- Pierre knows.
Can I count on you, Julie?
Thank you!
"58 kilo" a water castle Saint- Andreaskruis...
Good evening...
Nice to see you again
I caught him in your car.
Back into the seeds of... the leader of Bob Cramer!
What' s happened there?
He seems have hit something undoubtedly.
Someone helps him out from his car.
His sight is piece.
He will undoubtedly let Boorman take his place
What are you doing here?
What' s happened?
Accident, A Pigeon.
You must win...
"the leader"!
Michel...
There is something happening
It has nothing to do with me
It' s Cramer who put the crystal in the David' s car...
He wa just slowing him down...
The accident...
Be careful
What are you doing?
Drivers change, and it is Cramer
Quick!
Ruth herself... commands
Go now race and win!
Be a good child your father like!
Michel of Vaillantes shows up again!
Julie, have a rest!
Slow down!
Vaillant!
Why are you here, mom?
Oh...
Where is your father?
Over there
He said he wants to listen to the sound of motor...
I accompany you
No, I just have a sit
Danger!
Don' t worry, I can take care of myself!
Be back soon, ok?
Vaillants attacks!
Seems want to break away from Cramer
The two cars hit each other!
A furious fight
What' s up?
It loses control
But after an escapade on the grass, "the leader" succeeds finding its way back!
How come!
But Michel Vaillant is again in the attack of "the leader"!
Mom!
A horrible collision!
The Vaillante flies away!
Stand aside!
It' s me, look, it' s me!
Julie!
Yet no news about the health... of Bob Cramer and Michel Vaillant a dreadful accident...
Let' s go!
Mom!
Michel!
I' m alright, don' t worry!
Nor hurt
Where is my father?
I' m on the way getting him
Great!
Oh my children!
Gabrielle Spangenberg has already sit there for almost 4 hours
If no reasons... no qualification for the race
He is totally alone.
The others are far behind.
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Get on the car!
A bit sick
Let me see!
Shit!
30 goes faster and faster!
22 of "The leader" takes the leaderhip
Alright?
It goes well.
Besides, we have no choice.
Let' go!
Noway!
Only 15 minutes left, can' t stop!
Michel!
Second in the racers that is behind "the leader",... is the Vaillante no.

Your body- guard!
Hopefully you ring me with a good reason.
I believe you.
8, Steve Warson
The American must catch up with "the leader" for 3 minutes And 12 seconds
Warson improves...
Pulverizes the job record!
Leaky tyre for Steve Warson!
What happened?
Can you ride yet?
Shit!
Incredible!
"The leasers" is just one step away from the victory!
Stand aside!
Get off and push it!
Go away!
We must win anyway!
Cheer up!
Hurry!
I must win!
The 70th 24 hours of Le Mans ends now!
Oh yes.
But let me have a try

Quiet, missy, cursed pirates sail these waters.
You don' t want to bring them down on us now, do ya?
- Mr. Gibbs that will do!
- She was singing about pirates.
Bad luck to be singing about pirates with us mired in this unnatural fog.
Consider them marked.
On your way.
Aye, Lieutenant.
It' s bad luck to have a woman on board, too, even a miniature one.
I think it' d be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
Think again, Miss Swann.
Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them.
I intend to see to that any man who sails under a pirate flag or...... wears a pirate brand gets what he deserves.
A short drop and a sudden stop.
But I' m... I' m concerned about the effect this subject will have upon my daughter.
My apologies, Governor Swann.
- Actually, I find it all fascinating.
- Yes, that' s what concerns me.
Look, a boy!
There' s a boy in the water!
Man overboard!
Haul him aboard!
He' s still breathing.
Mary, Mother of God!
What happened here?
It' s most likely the powder magazine.
Merchant vessels run heavily armed.
A lot of good it did them.
Everyone' s thinking it.
There' s no proof of that.
It was probably an accident.
- Rouse the Captain immediately!
- Aye, sir.
Heave to and take in sail, launch the boats.
Elizabeth I want you to accompany the boy.
He' il be in your charge.
Take care of him.
It' s ok.
My name' s Elizabeth Swann.
Will Turner.
I' m watching over you, Will.
- You' re a pirate!
- Has he said anything?
His name is William Turner, that' s all I found out.
Take him below.
Elizabeth!
Are you alright?
- Are you decent?
- Yes, yes!
Still abed at this hour?
It' s a beautiful day.
I have a gift for you.
- Oh, it' s beautiful!
- Isn' t it?
May I inquire as to the occasion?
Does a father need an occasion to dote upon his daughter?
Go on.
I had hoped you might wear it for the ceremony today.
The ceremony?
Captain Norringtons promotion ceremony.
I knew it!
Fine gentleman, don' t you think.
He fancies you.
Elizabeth?
How' s it coming?
It' s difficult to say.
I' m told it' s the latest fashion in London.
Well, women in London must' ve learned not to breathe.
M' lord, you have a visitor.
Ah, Mr. Turner, good to see you again.
Good day, sir.
I have your order.
The blade is folded steel, that' s gold filigree laid into the handle.
If I may?
Perfectly balanced.
The tang is nearly the full width of the blade.
Impressive, very impressive.
Ah, now, Commodore Norrington is going to be very pleased with this.
Do pass my compliments on to your Master.
I shall.
A craftsman is always pleased to hear his work is appreciated.
- Ah, Elizabeth, you look absolutely stunning.
- Will.
So good to see you!
- I had a dream about you last night.
- About me?
Elizabeth, is that entirely proper for you to...?
About the day we met, do you remember?
How could I forget, Miss Swann?
Will, how many times must I ask you to call me Elizabeth?
At least once more, Miss Swann, as always.
There, see, at least the boy has a sense of propriety.
Now, we really must be going.
Farewell.
Good day, Mr. Turner.
Come along.
Good day...... Elizabeth.
What?
Hold up there, you.
It' s a shilling to tie up your boat at the dock.
And I shall need to know your name.
What d' ye say to three shillings and we forget the name?
Welcome to Port Royal, Mr. Smith.
Two paces front!
Right about turn!
Present...... arms!
This dock is off limits to civilians.
I' m terribly sorry, I didn' t know.
If I see one...... I shall inform you immediately.
Apparently there' s some sort of a high toned and fancy to do up at the fort, eh?
How could it be that two upstanding gentlemen such as yourselves did not merit an invitation?
Someone has to make sure this dock stays off limits to civilians.
It' s a fine goal to be sure but it seems to me that a... a ship like that makes this one here a bit superfluous, really.
Ah, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough, but there' s no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
I' ve heard of one, supposed to be very fast, nigh un- catchable...
"The Black Pearl"
Well... there' s no real ship that can match the Interceptor.
- The Black Pearl is a real ship.
- No, no it' s not.
- Yes, it is, I' ve seen it.
- You' ve seen it?
- Yes.
- You haven' t seen it.
Yes, I have.
You' ve seen a ship with black sails...... that' s crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil...... that Hell itself spat him back out?
- No.
- No.
But I have seen a ship with black sails.
Oh, and no ship that' s not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil...... that Hell itself spat him back out could possibly...... have black sails therefore couldn' t possibly be any other...... ship than the Black Pearl.
Is that what you' re saying?
No.
Hey!
You!
Get away from there!
You don' t have permission to be aboard there, mate.
I' m sorry, it' s just it' s such a pretty boat - ship.
- What' s your name?
- Smith or... Smithy, if you like.
What' s your purpose in Port Royal, Mr. Smith?
Yeah, and no lies!
Well, then, I confess, it is my intention to commandeer one of these ships.
Pick up a crew in Tortuga, raid, pillage, plunder and otherwise pilfer my weasely black guts out.
I said no lies.
I think he' s telling the truth.
If he were telling the truth, he wouldn' t have told us.
Unless, of course, he knew you wouldn' t believe the truth even if he told it to you.
May I have a moment?
- You look lovely, Elizabeth.
- Yes?
I apologize if I seem forward but I... must speak my mind.
This promotion throws into sharp relief that which I have...... not yet achieved.
A marriage to a fine woman.
You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.
I can' t breathe.
Yes, I' m a bit nervous myself.
... and then they made me their chief.
Elizabeth?
Elizabeth!
Sir, it' s a miracle she missed them!
- Will you be saving her then?
- I can' t swim.
Pearl of the Kings Navy you are.
Do not lose these.
What was that?
I got her.
- Not breathing.
- Move!
Never would have thought of that.
Clearly you' ve never been to Singapore.
Where did you get that?
On your feet.
Elizabeth.
- Are you alright?
- Yes, I' m fine.
- Shoot him!
- Father!
Commodore, do you really intend to kill my rescuer?
I believe thanks are in order.
Had a brush with the East India Trading company, did we?
Hang him.
Keep your guns on him, men.
Gillette, fetch some irons.
Jack Sparrow, isn' t it?
- Captain Jack Sparrow, if you please, sir.
- Well, I don' t see your ship... Captain.
- I' m in the market as it were.
- He said he' d come to commandeer one.
- Told ya he was telling the truth.
These are his, sir.
No additional shots nor powder.
A compass that doesn' t point north.
And I half expected it to be made of wood.
You are, without doubt, the worst pirate I' ve ever heard of.
But you have heard of me.
Commodore, I really must protest.
Carefully Lieutenant.
Pirate or not this man saved my life.
One good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness.
Though it seems enough to condemn him.
Indeed.
Finally.
No, don' t shoot!
I knew you' d warm up to me.
Commodore Norrington, my effects, please...... and my hat.
Commodore!
- Elizabeth, it is Elizabeth isn' t it?
- It' s Miss Swann.
Miss Swann, if you' d be so kind.
Come, come, dear, we don' t have all day.
Now if you' d be very kind.
Easy on the goods, darling.
You' re despicable.
Sticks and stones, love.
I saved your life, you saved mine, we' re square.
Gentlemen, m' lady, you will always remember this as the day that you almost caught...... Captain Jack Sparrow.
- Now, will you shoot him?
- Open fire!
On his heels!
Gillette, Mr. Sparrow has a dawn appointment with the gallows...... I would hate for him to miss it.
Search upstairs.
Look lively, men.
Right where I left you.
Not where I left you.
You' re the one they' re hunting.
The pirate.
You seem somewhat familiar.
Have I threatened you before?
I make a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
Well, then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record.
So, if you' il excuse me...
Do you think this wise, boy...... crossing blades with a pirate?
You threatened Miss Swann.
Only a little.
You know what you' re doing, I' il give you that.
Excellent form...... but how' s your footwork?
If I step here...
Very good.
Now I step again.
Ta.
That is a wonderful trick.
Except once again you are between me and my way out.
And now you have no weapon.
I do!
And I practice with them...... three hours a day!
You need to find yourself a girl, mate.
Or, perhaps the reason you practice three hours a day is that you already found one...... and are otherwise incapable of wooing said strumpet.
You' re not a eunuch, are you?
I practice three hours a day, so that when I meet a pirate...... I can kill it.
You cheated!
Pirate!
- Move away!
- No!
- Please, move!
- No!
I cannot just step aside and let you escape.
This shot is not meant for you.
Excellent work, Mr. Brown.
You' ve assisted in the capture of a dangerous fugitive.
Just doing my civic duty, sir.
Take him away!
- Can you smell it?
- Come here, boy.
- Come here, boy.
You can keep doing that forever, the dog is never going to move.
Oh, excuse us if we haven' t resigned ourselves to the gallows just yet.
There you go, Miss.
It' s a difficult day for you, I am sure.
I suspected Commodore Norrington would propose but...... I must admit I wasn' t entirely prepared for it.
Well, I meant you being threatened by that pirate, sounds terrifying.
Oh, yes, it was terrifying.
But the Commodore proposed.
Fancy that.
Now that' s a smart match, Miss, if it' s not too bold to say.
It is a smart match.
He' s a fine man.
The sort any woman should dream of marrying.
Well, that Will Turner, he' s a fine man too.
That is too bold.
Well, begging your pardon, Miss, it was not my place.
- Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
- No, she hasn' t.
Well, she has had a very trying day.
Ghastly weather, don' t you think?
Bleak, very bleak.
What' s that?
Return fire!
I know those guns.
- It' s the Pearl.
- Black Pearl?
I' ve heard stories.
She' s been preying on ships and settlements for near ten years.
- Never leaves any survivors.
- No survivors?
Then where do the stories come from, I wonder?
Governor.
Barricade yourself in my office.
That' s an order!
Don' t!
Hello, chump.
- Girl!
Miss Swann, they' ve come to kidnap you.
- What?
- You' re the Governors daughter.
They haven' t seen you.
Hide and the first chance you get, run to the fort.
Gotcha!
- It' s hot!
- Come on.
We know you' re here, Poppet.
Poppet.
Come out.
We promise we wont hurt you.
We will find you, Poppet.
You' ve got something of ours and it calls to us.
The Gold calls to us.
'Ello, Poppet.
- Parley!
- What?
I invoke the right of parley.
According to the code of the brethren, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew...... you have to take me to your Captain.
I know the code.
If an adversary demands parley you can do them no harm until...... the parley is complete.
To blazes with the code.
She wants to be taken to the Captain.
And she' il go without a fuss.
We must honor the code.
Say goodbye!
Goodbye.
- Come on!
- Elizabeth.
Outta my way, scum!
My sympathies friend, you' ve no manner of luck at all.
Come on, doggy.
It' s just you and me now.
It' s you and ol 'Jack, come on.
Come on, good boy.
That’ s it, good boy, come on!
Bit closer, bit closer.
That' s it, that' s it, doggy.
Come on you filthy, slimy, mangy cad.
No, no, no, no, no, I didn' t mean it.
I didn' t...
This ain' t the armory.
Well, well, well, look what we have here Twigg?
Captain Jack Sparrow.
Last time I saw you, you were all alone on a godforsaken island.
Shrinking into the distance.
His fortunes aren' t improved much.
Worry about your own fortunes, gentlemen.
The deepest circle of Hell is reserved for betrayers and mutineers.
So there is a curse.
That' s interesting.
You know nothing of Hell.
That' s very interesting.
I didn' t know we were takin 'on captives.
She' s invoked the right of parley with Captain Barbossa.
- I am here to negotiate...
- You will speak when spoken to.
And ye' il not lay a hand on those under the protection of parley.
Aye, sir.
My apologies, Miss.
Captain Barbossa, I am here to negotiate the cessation of hostilities...... against Port Royal.
There are a lot of long words in there, Miss, we' re naught but humble pirates.
- What is it that you want?
- I want you to leave and never come back.
I' m disinclined to acquiesce to your request...... means no.
Very well.
I' il drop it.
Me holds are burstin 'with swag and that bit of shine matters to us?
- Why?
- It' s what you' ve been searching for.
I saw it eight years ago on the crossing from England.
Did ya now?
Fine.
Well, I suppose if it is worthless then there' s no point in me keeping it.
You have a name, Missy?
Elizabeth...
Turner.
I' m a maid in the Governors household.
Miss Turner...?
Bootstrap.
And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?
Family heirloom, perhaps?
I didn' t steal it if that' s what you mean.
Very well, you hand it over and we' il put your town to our rudder and never return.
Our bargain?
Still the guns and stow 'em, signal the men, set the flags...
You have to take me to shore.
According to the code of the order of the brethren...
First, your return to shore was not part of our negotiations...... nor our agreement so I must do nothing.
And secondly, you must be a pirate for the pirates code to apply and you' re not
And thirdly, the code is more what you' d call "guidelines" than actual rules.
Welcome aboard the Black Pearl, Miss Turner.
They' ve taken her.
They' ve taken Elizabeth.
Mr. Murtogg, remove this man.
We have to hunt them down, we must save her.
And where do you propose we start?
If you have any information concerning my daughter, please, share it.
That Jack Sparrow.
He talked about the Black Pearl.
Mentioned it, is more what he did.
Ask him where it is.
Make a deal with him he could lead us to it.
No... the pirates who invaded this Fort left Sparrow locked in his cell ergo....... they are not his allies.
Governor, we will establish their most likely course...
That' s not good enough!
Mr. Turner, you are not a military man, you are not a sailor.
You are a blacksmith and this is not the moment for rash actions.
Do not make the mistake of thinking you are the only man here...... who cares for Elizabeth.
- You, Sparrow!
- Aye.
You are familiar with that ship, the Black Pearl?
- I' ve heard of it.
- Where does it make berth?
Where does it make berth?
Have you not heard the stories?
Captain Barbossa and his crew of miscreants sailed from the dreaded Isla de Muerta.
It' s an island that cannot be found except by those who already know where it is.
The ships real enough.
Therefore it' s anchorage must be a real place.
Where is it?
- Why ask me?
- Because you' re a pirate.
And you want to turn pirate yourself, is that it?
Never.
- They took Miss Swann.
- Oh, so it is that you' ve found a girl.
Well, if you' re intending to brave all, hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady' s heart...... you' il have to do it alone, mate.
I see no profit in it for me.
- I can get you out of here.
- How' s that?
The keys run off.
I helped build these cells.
These are half pin- barrel hinges.
With the right leverage and a proper application of strength...... the door will lift free.
- What' s your name?
- Will Turner.
That will be short for William, I imagine.
Good, strong name.
No doubt, named for your father, aye?
Yes.
Well, Mr. Turner, I' ve changed me mind.
If you spring me from this cell, I swear on pain of death...... I shall take you to the Black Pearl and your bonny lass.
Do we have an accord?
- Agreed.
- Agreed, get me out.
Hurry, someone will have heard that.
Not without my effects.
We' re going to steal a ship?
That ship?
Commandeer.
Nautical term.
One question about your business boy, or there' s no use going.
This girl, how far are you willing to go to save her?
- I' d die for her.
- Oh, good.
No worries, then.
This is either madness or brilliance.
It' s remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
Everyone stay calm, we are taking over the ship.
Aye, avast!
This ship cannot be crewed by two men.
You' il never make it out of the bay.
I' m Captain Jack Sparrow, savvy?
Commodore!
Sir, they' ve taken the Dauntless!
Sparrow and Turner, they' ve taken the Dauntless!
Rash, Turner, too rash.
He is without doubt the worst pirate I have ever seen.
Here they come.
Bring her around!
Bring her around!
Search every cabin, every hold, down to the bilges.
Now!
Thank you, Commodore, for getting us ready to make way.
We' d have a hard time of it by ourselves.
Set top sails and clear up this mess.
With the wind a quarter astern, we wont catch them.
We don' t need to catch them just get them in range of the long nines.
Men, come about.
Run out the guns.
We open fire on our own ship, sir?
I' d rather see her at the bottom of the ocean than in the hands of a pirate.
Commodore, he' s disabled the rudder chain, sir.
Abandon ship!
That' s got to be the best pirate I' ve ever seen.
So it would seem.
When I was a lad living in England, my mother raised me by herself.
After she died, I came out here, looking for my father.
Is that so?
My father, Will Turner.
And in jail it was only after you learned my name that you agreed to help.
Since that' s what I wanted, I didn' t press the matter.
You knew my father.
I knew 'im.
Probably one the few who knew him as William Turner.
Everyone else just called him Bootstrap or Bootstrap Bill.
- Bootstrap?
- Good man, good pirate.
- I swear you look just like him.
- It' s not true.
He was a merchant sailor, a good, respectable man who obeyed the law.
He was a bloody pirate, a scallywag.
My father was not a pirate.
Put it away, son.
It' s not worth you getting beat again.
You didn' t beat me.
You ignored the rules of engagement.
And that' s no incentive for me to fight fair, is it?
Now as long as you' re just hanging there, pay attention.
For instance you can accept that your father was a pirate and a good man...... or you can' t.
But pirate is in your blood, boy, so you' il have to square with that someday.
And me, for example, I can let you drown.
But I can' t bring this ship into Tortuga all by me onesies, savvy?
So...
Can you sail under the command of a pirate...... or can you not?
Tortuga?
Tortuga.
More importantly, it is indeed a sad life that has never breathed deep the sweet proliferous bouquet that is Tortuga, savvy?
What do you think?
It' il linger.
I' il tell you mate.
If every town in the world were like this one...... no man would ever feel unwanted.
Scarlett!
Not sure I deserved that.
Giselle!
What?
I may have deserved that.
Curse you for breathing, you slack jawed idiot!
Mother' s love!
Jack!
The man who did the waking buys, the man who was sleeping, a drink.
Aye, that' il about do it.
I know where it' s going to be and I' m going to take it.
Well, you know better than me the tales of the Black Pearl.
He said you' d say that.
Fine.
And the apples?
One of those next.
It' s poisoned.
- You don' t know what this is, do ye?
- It' s a pirate medallion.
But the greed of Cortés was insatiable.
Aye.
Find it, we did.
We took them all!
Spent them and traded them.
We are cursed men, Miss Turner.
Compelled by greed we were, and now we are consumed by it.
There is one way we can end our curse.
Thanks to you we have the final piece.
And the blood to be repaid?
That' s why there' s no sense to be killing you... yet!
Apple?
I feel nothing, not the wind on my face nor the spray of the sea.
Nor the warmth of a woman' s flesh.
What are ye looking at?
So this is your able- bodied crew?
He' s a mute, sir.
Mr. Cotton' s... parrot.
Same question.
- Mostly, we figure, that means "yes".
- O' course it does.
Well, you' ve proved they' re mad.
- You stole my boat!
Borrowed, borrowed without permission.
- But you didn' t!
- You' il get another one - I will.
Aye!
That one.
No, no, no, no, no, it' s frightful bad luck to bring a woman aboard, sir.
It' d be far worse not to, however.
- We should drop canvas, sir.
- She can hold a bit longer.
We' re catching up.
Dead men tell no tales.
What?
Well, he plays things close to the vest now.
So, Jack gives up the bearings.
That night there was a mutiny.
They marooned Jack on an island and left him to die.
Now Will, when a pirate is marooned he is a given a pistol with a single shot.
Well it won' t do much good hunting or to be rescued.
But after three weeks of starvin 'belly and thirst that pistol...... starts to look real friendly.
Oh, but he won' t use it though, save for one man.
- Barbossa.
- Aye.
Captain!
- Aye, the code.
- And now we' re finally getting to spend it.
Stop rubbing it.
Any man who falls behind is left behind.
You know for having such a bleak outlook on pirates you' re well on your way to becoming one.
I' m not obsessed with treasure.
Not all treasure is silver and gold, mate.
Salvation is nigh!
- Elizabeth.
Punished we were.
The cursed treasure of Cortés himself.
When' s that?
May I ask you something?
- And whose blood must yet to be paid?
Waste not.
Did it work?
- It didn' t work.
- No.
You two.
She had the medallion, she' s the proper age.
You brought us here for nothing!
I won' t take questions and no second guesses, not from the likes of you, Master Twigg.
Every decision you' ve made has led us from bad to worse.
And it' s you who brought us here in the first place!
You pack of ingrates!
The oars have gone missing.
- Parley?
Parley!
- Mr. Gibbs?
Keep to the code.
Make quickly.
Ah, well, I won' t be making that mistake again.
- Gents, you all remember Captain Jack Sparrow?
Kill him!
- Here, let me.
What say you to that?
Everything!
With a will!
Lower the anchor on the right side.
- You' re daft, lady!
- Daft like Jack.
Lower the starboard anchor!
Hard aport.
- Fire!
- We' il give them her.
- She' s not what they' re after.
Grapples, at the ready.
That' s not very nice.
Where' s the medallion?
Wretch!
- Ah, where' s dear William?
- Will.
- Elizabeth!
- You' re welcome.
Not you.
We named the monkey Jack.
- Gents, our hope is restored!
- Yeah!
Welcome back, Miss.
Will.
- What' s in your head, boy?
- She goes free!
Like that.
- Who are you?
Anything else?
Go on!
Did ya not notice?
Off you go.
By the powers, you' re right.
Seeing as there' s two of us, a gentleman would give us a pair of pistols.
But you were marooned on this island before, weren' t you?
To what point and purpose, young missy?
Really bad eggs!
And we' il sing it all the time.
The entire ocean... the entire world.
What are you doing?
Why is the rum gone?
The entire Royal Navy is out looking for me.
Just wait, Captain Sparrow.
You give it one hour, maybe two, keep a weather eye open and you will see...... white sails on that horizon.
Must' ve been terrible for you to be trapped here, Jack.
You' re safe now.
The boy' s fate is regrettable.
The Black Pearl.
The last real pirate threat in the Caribbean, mate.
How can you pass that up?
Elizabeth.
I know.
You will accompany these fine men to the helm and provide us...... with the bearing to Isla de Muerta.
Shiver me timbers.
Never sat well with Bootstrap what we did to Jack Sparrow.
The mutiny and all.
He said it wasn' t right with the code.
That' s why he sent off a piece of the treasure to you as it were.
He said we deserved to be cursed...... and remain cursed.
But as you can imagine... that didn' t sit too well with the Captain.
Tell him what Barbossa did.
That' s what you call ironic.
I don' t care what the Commodore ordered, I have to tell him.
- Don' t worry, miss, he' s already informed of that.
This is Jack Sparrow' s doing.
He' s only half- Turner.
Beg your pardon.
- It' s not possible.
- Not probable.
- Where' s Elizabeth?
She' s all set to marry Norrington, just like she promised.
Your funeral.
- Well, because...
- With the cannons and all.
But what of the Pearl?
Commodore.
We have an accord.
Take a walk!
A moment, please.
Elizabeth?
Elizabeth?
I already feel like a fool.
I look nice?
I must admit, Jack, I thought I had ye figured.
It turns out that you' re a hard man to predict.
I' m dishonest, and a dishonest man you can always trust to be...... dishonest.
It' s the honest ones you want to watch out for.
You' re off the edge of the map, mate.
Roger that.
I think we should decide now.
Just so we' re ready when the time comes.
Sorry.
Or you could surrender.
Ready?
Any port in the storm.
Cotton' s right, we' ve got the Pearl.
- Jack owes us a ship.
You' re pirates, hang the code and hang the rules.
- What?
Bloody pirates!
Ah, me eye!
- Whose side is Jack on?
- At the moment?
And for these crimes you have been sentenced to be on this day...... hung by the neck until dead.
Governor Swann.
Can' t breathe.
Move!
And a good man.
If all I have achieved here is that the hangman will earn two pairs... of boots instead of one, so be it.
- As is mine.
- Elizabeth.
Will... nice hat.
Sir?
Mr. Turner.
What about Sparrow?
So, this is the path you' ve chosen, is it?
He' s a pirate.
Captain Sparrow.
And really bad eggs.
{y: i} Here was Troy 3000 years ago, {y: i} a city of destiny... {y: i}... so situated that it dominated {y: i} the Hellespont... {y: i}... today known as the Dardanelles.
{y: i} This was the only sea route {y: i} to and from the east.
{y: i} As a result, Troy grew prosperous... {y: i}... a tempting prize of war {y: i} for the Greek nations.
{y: i} The Trojans had long memories of the {y: i} time when the Greeks, led by Sparta... {y: i}... had pillaged and burned {y: i} the city of their fathers.
{y: i} They had prepared strong defenses {y: i} against the possibility of future assault.
{y: i} That is why new Troy, {y: i} their rebuilt city... {y: i}... was guarded by mighty walls, {y: i} an impregnable shelter... {y: i}... for a happy people in love with beauty.
{y: i} In the palace square {y: i} and the busy streets... {y: i}... the industrious citizens were enjoying {y: i} the works of peace... {y: i}... as though this carefree era {y: i} would last forever.
{y: i} There was Lord Aeneas, {y: i} nephew of King Priam... {y: i}... on his way to the palace... {y: i}... where the future of Troy {y: i} was being weighed by the royal council.
And so we' ve locked out the understanding of nations...... and we' ve locked in the poison.
Trojans jumping at every rumor...... pointing fingers at each other.
I tell you there' s only one solution.
Have your way.
Go to Sparta.
Go wherever you will...... but don' t try to drag the destiny of Troy with you.
What destiny, to live like a crab in a shell?
We live well.
That' s our blood.
Stupidity!
We' il choke on our own fat unless we sail our ships of trade.
But how can we, when every harbor is an enemy' s?
- Oh, I' m sick of your crazy dreams.
- Careful, brother.
Paris has always been able to crack your neck.
And you can thrash us both.
- Tell him he' s a fool, Hector!
- My sons...... the fool is the man who makes a quarrel of a debate.
Paris, I bless your plan to sail to Sparta.
I know I can trust you not to beg for peace.
I' il try to convince the Greeks our power makes a treaty advisable.
I' d convince them.
I' d take 100 ships of war and burn the soil of Sparta black!
I' m sure you would, Polydorus, and create endless war.
And you, Hector, do you aspire to anything...
-... but to excel at swordplay and boxing?
- Yes, sire.
The javelin and the discus.
Hector' s a good son, Priam.
And a good husband, my lord.
Is that not sufficient glory?
By your leave, Paris' ship is ready to sail.
Do the gods approve the day and the hour?
The omens are good and also the prophecies, with but one exception.
One troubled priestess of the temple.
- My daughter.
- Don' t be angry, Priam.
- Cassandra is ill.
- Sick in the mind.
Arise, Paris...... and go.
The virgin Cassandra does make one point that causes me much concern.
Prince Paris, it appears, gives all his worship to one goddess alone.
- Aphrodite.
- I' m not sure I worship anything.
Admiration is the better word.
Admiration for the beauty of a marble image.
It was not the goddess of beauty who taught us to arm against our enemies...... but Athena, the goddess of wisdom...... and the patroness of the horses of war.
This solitary adoration of yours.
Neither is she delighted that you undertake a mission of peace.
And I suppose that evil horse of hers will spring out and trample me.
Let it come, my lord...... if that' s the price of living in a world of fables.
Do not say that, Paris.
Do not seek peace elsewhere, dear brother...... until first you have pacified Athena.
My little Cassandra, there can be no postponement.
Give me your blessing for a happy voyage.
I cannot bless what I see in your future.
Cassandra!
- Cassandra, stop this.
- But, Father, it' s true.
What I see and feel is true.
Go, Paris.
- Come and rest a while.
- How can I, Mother?
Oh, I wish it hadn' t been given me...... this agony I live with.
Paris!
Paris, don' t go.
Please don' t go.
- I must sail at once.
- If you have any love for Troy...... don' t bring this dreadful thing upon us.
- And I thought you loved me best of all.
- I do, but...... the noise, the storm grows so great.
The screaming of horses, the cries of dying men.
- Take care of her.
- My dear, my dear.
Perhaps it could not be otherwise.
What must be, no one can change.
Far from it.
We' re nearing Sparta...... a harsh military land, where a man will cut off his arm to prove he' s brave.
- I wonder what the women look like.
- My profound Cousin Aeneas.
To think deeply, Paris, one must think of women.
They bring all life into the world and much death.
- They sway the destinies of men.
- Not my destiny.
What' s the matter?
But I don' t like the hot breath of it.
Oh, it' s nothing.
Only one drifting cloud up there.
Up the mast with you!
Climb the mast!
- Drop the sail!
My prince, the ropes are fouled, and these men refuse to climb the mast.
- I' il flay them!
- No!
There' s only one way to cure these fantasies.
No, my prince, not you.
Paris!
Paris!
Paris!
Paris!
Paris!
Megas!
Aphrodite.
What?
Some ship had bad luck.
She does exist.
- Who?
- The fairest goddess.
This creature is crazy.
But with a nice sort of craziness.
What was your ship?
-... of Troy.
- A Trojan.
Cut him loose, Andros.
Maybe we can warm some life into him before we turn him over to the soldiers.
Women!
Why warm a man to cut his throat?
Cover him up, quickly.
We' re looking for our sovereign lady, the Queen of Sparta.
She came to the shore to visit a nurse of her childhood days.
- My lady.
- I left orders not to be disturbed here.
But there are certain developments which make this beach unsafe today.
A strange ship was sighted running out of the storm.
Heavy seas.
It' s possible she left spies.
You see Trojan phantoms everywhere.
- This was no phantom ship.
- The emblem of the royal House of Troy.
The king would want me to insist that his queen return at once.
lnform King Menelaus that Cora is taking excellent care of me.
Go along now.
Very well, my lady.
Andraste!
- A man, my lady?
How interesting!
- Yes.
What if he' s a warrior and only pretending?
You must be careful.
Women who are always careful miss much in life, Andraste.
But his heart beats.
- Oh, no!
They' il kill him.
- I still say good.
-... if he were as unattractive as you.
- Thank you.
To whom am I indebted for this gallant defense?
Nobody of importance.
I am only a slave.
Now tell us about yourself, Trojan.
Did I mention that?
But I do recall I thought you a vision.
A goddess.
Dear Aphrodite...... allow me to present myself.
- Prince Paris of Troy.
- We' il dispense with impudence.
You' re a bit impudent yourself for whatever you are, a slave?
- Silence!
You' re addressing -- - A slave of the palace, Andros.
Of what importance is that?
I tell you truly, I am Prince Paris.
I come to offer a treaty of peace to King Menelaus.
But of course, you don' t believe me.
My articles of identity...... all the gifts I was bringing to the Court of Sparta....
They' il swear the gods hurled lightning at me.
Perhaps I do believe you.
The sea has damaged your appearance, but not your manner.
Follow the coast.
You' il reach a cove where Phoenician ships put in.
- No.
I still have a mission.
- Do as I tell you!
Our soldiers have a habit of plunging a dagger into strangers.
Never mind.
The feelings of a slave are of no importance.
They are to me.
In any place but Sparta, one so fair would be a queen.
In Troy, we' d make songs about you.
King Menelaus would not permit that here.
Because you' d make his queen look plain.
Do you know her?
She owns me.
I' m her shadow.
And I always thought I knew her.
No, I don' t believe anyone knows Queen Helen very well...
-... including Helen.
- Not even the king?
Great power doesn' t need knowledge.
Wait.
I only ask these questions...
-... because I must go to the palace.
- Don' t chance it.
I intend to be discreet, so prepare me.
If Menelaus won' t help me, I' il ask the queen.
That you must never do!
Oh, if you were old and ugly, maybe then she could help you.
But you' re not old, nor ugly.
It' s late, Andros.
We must get the fish to market.
If the soldiers find him here, I don' t want to be involved.
I wouldn' t mind.
We must get back to the palace, Andraste.
I' ve stayed here too long.
Promise me...... we' il meet again.
You can go back now.
Supplies, for your voyage home.
So you still hope I won' t go to the palace?
More than ever.
The kings of Greece are gathering there to consider a war against Troy.
Then my mission was well- timed.
- When will they be in council?
- Tomorrow, perhaps.
But tonight...... there are only you and l.
Under the magic of the moonlight.
See what I brought you?
My dear little slave girl...... I don' t want what you steal from the palace.
I only want what I steal from the palace.
No, my prince.
But we' il be quite honest about it.
- I' il offer to buy you from the queen.
That would mean death!
Nonsense.
I' il explain to her that you' re no slave to me...... but my future Princess of Troy.
Let me go, Paris.
Don' t you believe I could love a slave?
Yes, I believe.
My heart believes and loves you.
My heart is yours, Paris, but I can never be.
You must not seek out the queen, nor anyone at the palace.
And this moment must be our last.
Don' t ask me why.
Call it magic, call it a dream.
And never speak of it to anyone.
Hear our Spartan host, King Menelaus.
- Are you sure Ulysses is coming?
- His ship was not far behind mine.
This great Ithacan refused to leave his wife and farm.
He' s so sick of war, he wouldn' t let go of the plow.
Till his child was cast in front of it, to convince him Greece' s glory...... comes before contentment.
You can have the glory.
I' il take Troy' s gold.
Not my share, brother.
Ulysses, King of lthaca!
Greetings, friend.
You' re acquainted with everyone.
Ajax, Prince of Salamis.
Nestor, King of Pylos.
Diomedes, ruler of Aetolia.
And I think you know my brother, King Agamemnon of Mycenae.
Greetings, fellow pirates.
It is a righteous war we plan, Ulysses...... a war of defensive aggression.
A neat sort of righteousness.
You think the Trojans built a citadel for peace- lovers?
Have you heard of Priam' s sons?
Polydorus begs for war!
Hector wants only a challenge.
Paris is anyone' s equal with a cestus, bow and javelin.
You believe they want peace?
But he hates my brother and me --
He hates you almost as much as he loves war.
In order to lock himself from all temptation of joining with us...... he hid himself securely, in a house of women.
That' s where I found him, hiding from all persuasion...... dressed as a woman!
Yes.
He' s here at the stables, seeing to the care of his horses.
Achilles, a blushing girl.
I shall commend him for the beauty of his face and figure.
The man who blows his own horn.
Commend him, Menelaus.
I commend you, Achilles.
And I despise you.
And you, Agamemnon.
But it seems we must unite...... so I am here to lead you.
- Lead us, Achilles?
- Of course.
Since we were boys, we could stand alone and defy an army.
- I question that.
- Who?
I, Ajax.
My imitator.
You disgusting glory- hunter.
To imitate him, I' d need to wear three layers of armor.
That' s where he gets his reputation for being invulnerable.
Silence this fool, Menelaus.
I would prefer not to be angered by him.
The truth of the matter is, his skin' s as tender as his vanity.
And especially his heel.
- He can' t even stand leather against it.
- I do not fight with my feet.
Take your ease, my prince.
I' il handle this buffoon.
Enough of this.
We must remain united.
lmpossible.
We' ve never been united, and we never will be.
Keep my horses ready.
Patroclus, we shall leave.
I see no ethical purpose for a raid on Troy.
- Now, wait.
Wait.
Here.
You talk of ethics.
Here' s the sign of a Trojan ship prowling our shores.
No peaceful trader, but a royal ship of the House of Priam.
It was my ship, sire.
I am Paris of Troy.
- Yes.
Sorry to present myself like this, I was swept overboard in the storm.
Fortunately, this gathering of the most royal of Greece...... makes my mission easier.
- How' d you know we were here?
- I beg my lord' s indulgence, I know.
So I' m saved from journeying to each king...... if you decide against offers of peace I bring from Troy.
- Troy does not plan war?
You are wrong, Menelaus.
Stop this or lose your Trojan plunder.
- He came to the palace.
- I thought you' d question him.
- Hear him.
- This is our business.
He' s only some wandering vagabond.
See the rags he wears.
And they never fail to have some nimble talent.
What do you do besides this royal imposture?
It seems I try to do the impossible.
If he' s Paris, he should have some skill with the cesti.
- Brilliant, brother, brilliant.
- You heard, Ajax, Achilles?
Achilles is weary from travel.
Achilles did not make his reputation fighting children.
This Sparta, my son, is a viper' s nest.
- I' il see you aren' t -- - If we offend the pretender...
-... I give him leave to go.
- No.
But I must exact an agreement.
If I come fairly out of this fight, will you believe that I am Paris...... and hear the Trojan peace terms?
If your head' s still on your shoulders, yes.
Paris!
My good Trojan, you have used a Spartan persuasion on me: courage.
My courage almost failed me at the thought of meeting Ajax.
And tomorrow we shall talk.
About your adventures, your voyage...... and the secret charm that makes me call you "friend."
And Troy shall call Sparta "friend."
Alpheus, find quarters for our guest.
And, Alpheus...... they say the Trojans have great eyes for beauty.
Find him a slave and see that she is beautiful.
There is one slave in your palace for whom I' d gladly become a slave myself.
Menelaus!
You expressed a wish yesterday to present your guests to me.
A proud wish.
Helen, Queen of Sparta, wife to Menelaus...... I present Paris, Prince Royal of Troy.
Why are you here, Trojan?
To study our arts and culture?
The art of self- preservation.
Trojan impudence!
By your leave, my lord...... I shall receive the Greeks at some happier moment.
I heard my lady was truly Spartan this afternoon.
My heart behaved like a fool.
I' m sure Menelaus could hear it beating.
You may go.
- When will you learn?
The man can neither speak nor hear.
What did you think of the Trojan?
- You saw what I thought.
- Yes, I saw what you thought.
Of this Trojan anyway.
What is this game you' re playing?
So does he.
Speak plainly.
If I' ve given you some offense, punish me...... but don' t welcome a stranger with one hand and strike him with the other!
So now we' re fond of Trojans?
I might do many things with him.
I might send him home...... with his appearance altered.
I might hold him hostage to bleed tribute out of Priam.
I imagined once I had married a king.
- You married a king.
- I married a robber.
Why did you marry him?
When a king takes spoils, he robs no one.
He fulfills justice.
The way of a Spartan.
You do not.
I understand enough.
Then understand your place in the palace, nowhere else!
You' ve seen this man before.
Admit it.
Your silence condemns you.
You' ve been out of the palace secretly.
You know this man.
Silent as ever.
No words for me, your husband.
I am your husband!
- Don' t.
Say "husband" to me.
I can think of many ways of dealing with your Trojan, Helen.
Andraste.
I am the slave sent to the Prince of Troy.
The queen' s handmaiden, eh?
The king commands me to entertain his guests.
He' s in a prison, if he only knew it.
Oh, I' m instructed that he shall not know it.
Must King Menelaus command you himself to admit me?
The royal temper' s already running a fever.
Shall I tell the king you said that?
Get to your business, you little troublemaker.
You should be in bed.
Yes, I should but --
No.
She sent me to help you escape.
Escape?
Those two soldiers on watch down there...... are they going to help me too?
You' re a captive.
The king plans tortures for you.
You must leave quickly.
Return to the fisherman' s hut.
I' il go a distance with you to point the way.
My good friend Menelaus.
- The door is also watched.
- Then what chance have I?
Any fool could see you' re a prince.
- Fisherman!
- Fisherman!
Yes?
- A cup of wine.
- Our throats are salted by the breeze.
Cora, the wineskin.
The captain' s an idiot.
Does he think the man will swim?
He' d be deep in the forest by now.
Here.
Take it with you.
Go, and remember, there will be soldiers above...... so you' d best try the rocks under the cliff.
There, a boat will send you to the ship.
Wings of Mercury speed you.
Why do you wait?
It was just a foolish hope.
- I half- imagined she' d come.
- Here?
She sent you garments...... arranged for a Phoenician ship to take you home.
- I only hoped.
- Don' t even breathe it.
If she should show her face here and be recognized....
And I wish I could repay you for your kindness.
And for the queen...... tell her she' il walk in all my dreams.
Wait!
The ship is not yet in the cove.
Helen.
Andraste, you are free.
- Go as far away as you can from Sparta.
- My lady.
You made clear to Adelphus what I said?
- He is far off by this time.
- Then be on your way.
Freedom is made of quicksilver sometimes.
Go.
Hurry.
Helen.
Helen is the queen.
The girl you thought you knew was quite nameless and without reality.
I can' t believe that.
- It was she who helped me to escape.
That was the queen who hates cruelty.
She would have done the same for any slave.
I see.
She is the queen who comes here to say this.
She will always remember the gentle Paris.
And she will do her small part to turn this nation from war.
- You' re not a Spartan.
Daughter of a king who chose a Spartan husband for me.
A man you despised.
I despise oppression, as do many others here.
And we need to be understood.
You, not Menelaus, will be Sparta to me.
I' il tell my father there' s still hope.
I' il tell Troy what I' ve seen and heard.
The rulers divided, unable to find cause for war...... even the Spartan people.
Stop worrying.
The kings have been carousing all night.
And so she is real, that one I loved.
Yes.
The gods sometimes change the bravest of intentions.
They are kind.
I' il never doubt them again.
Oh, Helen.
Helen, you are a slave as long as Menelaus possesses you.
Come to Troy with me.
And destroy the hope of peace you were taking home with you?
No.
If even one Trojan dies on the walls, I' m a failure.
Forgive me, Helen.
You are two women, both wise and good.
I am two men.
The other, very bad indeed.
One is a man.
The other just a boy, I think.
Paris, let him be so always.
Never let him grow old.
Helen.
The ship.
And now I must go back.
It is a way the gods have...... to give with one hand and take with two.
This is not goodbye.
You shall still be with me across the sea.
And you with me.
And always young, Paris, remember?
What is remembered is forever young.
Halt!
Stand still, Trojan.
- My lady, I ask you remove yourself -- - Send your archers away.
I beg the queen to stand out of danger.
You wouldn' t dare.
You' il die.
I can no more than lose my own life, and it' s lost if I let him go.
Silence!
Helen!
Helen!
Helen!
She' s in there.
- No.
- She' s in there.
- Break them.
Break.
It' s true.
He' s carried her away.
By force, against her will.
To think of her struggles, her fruitless cries for help.
We had our differences, but she was my wife.
This is the assault of all women in Greece.
Shame on every Greek nation.
Follow them.
Ulysses, why do you sit?
She must be restored to me.
- Yes.
Now, now, now!
Will you not stand with me?
But only if you wait.
We' il send out a call to every city in Greece.
All Greeks united in a war of honor.
That' s what the future will call it.
I call it that now.
This Prince of Troy has asked for war, not peace.
Ulysses.
I' m sure you' il agree with me that it is my duty to become our leader.
Leader?
I' il see no one but Achilles as leader.
It is my consecrated duty to become our leader to avenge my dear brother.
Quite, quite, Agamemnon.
And tell you what to do, as usual.
And I will persuade the sensitive Achilles...... with certain fascinating facts...... about the great store of gold to be found in Troy.
I seek no treasure.
I will kill.
So shall we all, brother.
To defend your honor.
Who are they?
I don' t know, but I know the color of their gold.
Sparta is the past, Helen.
Troy is this way.
What will they call us there?
A woman who left her husband.
A prince turned thief.
What else can we ever be?
Two people in love.
Against the world, if need be.
If I could make a bargain with the gods...... we would escape the world...... never landing on any shore.
A lovely dream, but somewhere we must land.
Paris, there' s an island called Pelagos.
The sea can feed us.
And there are little houses near the village well.
Let' s go there.
I cannot.
I was born to an obligation.
Paris, son of Priam, heir to responsibility.
I could leave the kingdoms of the world and never miss them.
- But you -- - Helen...... our life together will fade if I run from this.
It will become a slight thing that any storm can tear apart.
No, Paris.
Forgive me.
I forget you are a woman, not a goddess.
Captain.
- It' s far southward...
-... through the Cytherean straits.
- Sail southward.
- Captain.
- Yes?
We have decided otherwise.
Sail north to Troy.
- What is it?
- You' il have to see, Lord Aeneas.
Wait.
Aeneas, call the queen.
Paris!
Paris.
Come and meet my brothers.
Hector, Polydorus.
I told you about them.
Lucky Paris.
You could fall in the black pit of Hades...... and come out with arms full of sunshine.
He' s always had a fine flair for surprises.
I' m happy to see that you diverted your mission...... to an enterprise more to your talents.
Come.
- Aeneas.
- Paris.
- Paris.
- I should have had faith.
-... and with him our hopes of peace.
- It' s a miracle.
Tell us what happened, Paris.
I would never have seen Troy again but for her.
It would have taken a sea sprite to save you.
How could one so tender have managed it?
Postpone your questions.
She suffered an ordeal that I shan' t relate in her presence.
It' s enough that our son has been given back to us by you, my dear.
You are welcome, my child.
See that she is made comfortable.
Later, you shall tell me of your adventures.
At your command, Father.
My brother seems to have forgotten his courtliness.
By what name, my lady, shall we know you?
- My name is -- - Her name is death.
- Cassandra!
She suffers an illness.
Wait.
You were going to say?
I am Helen, Queen of Sparta.
The wife of King Menelaus?
- His wife no more.
- The goddess of beauty, Aphrodite...... come down to Earth in mortal form.
She will bring the disaster I have prophesied.
Her name will be written in letters of fire.
Helen.
Helen of Troy.
And she saved my life again...... but at such risk to herself that I couldn' t leave her...... to the mercy of the Spartans.
But in your affection for me and mine for you...... I hope you will judge me fairly.
I would never have believed that this could happen...... not through this son of mine.
This son who shared my hope of everlasting peace.
And what have you brought?
Dishonor.
You have united the Greeks.
You have kindled a flame that will weld them together against us.
This will bring them to our very shores.
That should delight you.
You may have to answer for the death of many a good Trojan.
You have presumed too much upon our affection.
Paris...... send her back to Sparta and make your peace with Menelaus.
I' il never send her back.
- You reject every word of wisdom?
- My love has no logic.
It could only choose between Troy and Pelagos.
Helen wanted to go to Pelagos...... but I had to bring you the warning.
But she was right.
There is no heart in Troy.
We' il seek it elsewhere.
The coward' s way to avoid the fight?
- You exceed the rights of a brother.
- And you....
You scorn every Trojan duty.
The damage is done.
Go or stay.
It matters not.
- I shall not see you again.
- Priam.
Bring to the council chamber the armory masters and the granary stewards.
Tell them I want an estimate of Troy' s ability to withstand a siege.
There were times when I almost forgot that I had other children, Paris...... others to die, perhaps.
Destiny, Paris.
Destiny.
Every Trojan woman with son or husband will curse you.
Well, don' t worry, brother, a war may clear the atmosphere.
War, the only thing that could make you happy.
Keep out of my way, or you' il never live to enjoy it.
- Lord Aeneas.
- You may go.
The ship that brought you to Troy is still in the harbor.
My charioteer will take you there.
I see.
Or if my lady prefers, I' il arrange for a royal escort.
No, I won' t delay.
Wait for us.
My chariot will be in the courtyard.
Athena wields much power, it seems.
- If I return to Menelaus -- - No.
Pelagos?
Yes, I' il take you to Pelagos.
You said our lives would fade if you ran away.
I also said that you' d be happy in Troy.
Paris, the word has spread.
- They are not armed with flowers.
- Quick, before they overrun the courtyard.
They won' t as long as they enjoy their carnival.
- Take Helen to the harbor.
- Don' t show yourself to them.
- See her aboard the ship.
- Paris!
Dog!
You expect us to fight a war for your amusement?
My brave Trojans...... will you show as much spirit against the Spartan army...... as against one Spartan woman?
Can you stand alone, each, in battle...... or do you need the cowardice of numbers to make you bold?
Go home and search your hearts, Trojans...... for all this must be answered soon.
- Without you?
I' ve gained a victory of a sort tonight.
I mustn' t lose it, Helen.
There' s no Pelagos if I' m there alone.
But there' s always one island where the storm can' t touch us.
It' s anyplace, Paris, where we' re together.
- Here?
- Oh, yes, even here.
{y: i} News reached Troy {y: i} that the Greeks were about to sail... {y: i}... with the mightiest armada ever known {y: i} to man.
The Trojans prepared for war.
Our signals have never warned of so many ships.
We' re ready.
- Hundreds.
- Many more than we can count.
- Five, 600.
More.
- No less than 1000 ships.
- We' il make them pay a heavy price.
What shall we pay?
Aeneas, bring them here.
Let them see.
Yes, sire.
Faster.
Faster.
- See what you have brought upon us?
- Father.
The face that launched 1000 ships.
Now remember, these Trojan walls are our strength and our substance...... so let no eager fool attempt to charge this plain...... until these ramparts have served their purpose.
Well, to your posts.
Hector, where is my place?
Beside your Spartan woman.
I' il share Spartan blood with you.
You can have my share.
No Trojans to greet us?
I had hoped they' d be foolish enough to scatter their forces.
- Camp?
No, onwards.
Every moment of delay, my Helen suffers.
Our camp is the Trojan palace.
We must attack at once.
No.
We must equip to take this fortress.
Ulysses is right.
We must prepare.
{y: i} The canny counsel of Ulysses prevailed.
{y: i} The Greeks consolidated their beachhead {y: i} and built machines for attack... {y: i}... on a scale big enough {y: i} to match the Trojan walls.
Follow Achilles!
Hector.
Back!
- We' re outflanked!
Fall back!
Return to your towers.
Back!
Back!
Polydorus.
It' s a good war, Paris.
Hector, the man of peace...... now our greatest warrior.
Thank Helen for your destiny.
- Thank Paris.
- I thank him for my life.
Oh, great Zeus, king of all...... we give to you Polydorus, Prince of Troy.
I pray you, judge him with compassion and understanding.
Let not Athena' s hatred feed on my defenseless son...... but on our sorrow here.
We, the living dead of Troy, shall pay his debt...... in the years of siege to come.
{y: i} And the Greeks did prepare {y: i} for years of siege.
{y: i} They unloaded provisions {y: i} from their ships... {y: i}... and as time went on {y: i} they looted and raped... {y: i}... the small surrounding villages.
Take your hands off her!
- A warrior commanding his commander?
- She' s mine.
Great as you are, I' m still your chieftain, protector of all the spoils of war.
- Take her to my quarters.
- No.
Agamemnon, if you take this girl, I shall sail home.
- Agamemnon!
Come on.
- Sail home, great warrior.
No, Achilles.
Out!
Out!
Out!
Achilles, Agamemnon does not speak for all our people.
Dogs!
Jackals!
I' il never fight his battles again.
But for Greece, you' il fight.
No more.
{y: i} During these years of stalemate, {y: i} the Trojans... {y: i}... from the safety of their walls, {y: i} constantly harassed the invaders... {y: i}... with night raids on their camps.
- Helen, how perfect.
- The girl you fell in love with?
Always keep that image with you, Paris.
I have the source of its magic.
Right here, I hold its living warmth...... and its spirit is always with me on the ramparts.
Then it can' t be lost, can it?
What has been lived and shared is never lost.
- Never, Helen.
- But if you should lose me...... could you resign yourself to that?
Don' t worry, nothing will happen to you.
Nothing endures on Earth, Paris, neither sorrow nor happiness...... or people in love.
Dear Helen, she looks for shadows in the one bright place in Troy.
People in love should not be blind.
They should look to the future and prepare for separation.
But not so gloomily, my love.
I' il meet you in Elysium...... where an age of years is just a wink of time.
I' il take the flying horse, Pegasus.
To our island, Paris?
Oh, goddess come to Earth, make me immortal with your kiss...... and we' il live on nectar and ambrosia.
- But I' m not sure I like being so ethereal.
- Nor I.
How many years, fellow Trojans, shall we suffer?
Our only respite, a truce to burn our dead.
The holiday of a Troy that once knew happy times.
Must the Trojans always set their funeral pyre so near this house?
- How long will they accuse me?
Lulled by the promises of peace forever.
I, for one, believe we might have had that peace....
I thought I could escape from it, but there is no place --
- Go.
Leave me.
Paris commanded me to stay with you while he' s on duty.
Leave me, I tell you.
No, friends!
Hear me, Trojans.
Cast her to the Spartans.
Cast Paris out of Troy.
- If you haven' t the fiber for this....
- Helen, don' t go out.
I' ve sent soldiers to disperse them.
- You' ve come to ask me to leave Troy.
But for Paris, I would have lost Hector.
I must love my sons equally...... and whomsoever they love.
You are good.
The high priest says that even the gods fight each other.
Some for Athena and Greece, some for Troy and Aphrodite.
How, then, could I blame you for this war?
- I could stop it.
- No one could.
I could...... if I return to the Greeks, to Menelaus.
Go back to someone you so despise?
If it brings an end to war and restores Paris to the love of the Trojans....
- He' d never let you go.
- And could I ever leave him?
- You must help me to decide.
- Would you defy the Fates?
No mortal should attempt so much, Helen.
And yet I wonder...... is one so lovely quite mortal?
No.
I am everything I was determined not to be.
I have only been selfish.
All the despair, the pain and the tears I' ve brought.
How different from that island dream.
Return to your King of Troy...... and tell him we will receive Helen at the appointed place.
But warn him there must be no treachery or deceit.
I assure you, my lord, no deceit exists.
It is her wish to return to King Menelaus.
- It' s her wish.
You hear that, brother?
- I' ve heard it often.
Wait, herald.
Tell your master from Menelaus that we demand --
No, no, no.
Nothing else.
Nothing else, only the return of Helen.
The Trojans wish to make peace.
As men of peace, we accept their offer.
Have we suffered to return empty- handed?
Empty- handed, Menelaus?
With Helen returned, integrity satisfied?
You are too outspoken, brother.
When the Trojans have handed over Helen, we' il teach them...... that we' re not easily bought off.
But I' d like Achilles with us, in case they prove troublesome.
He still refuses to fight so long as you' re in command...... and your lovesick jackass of a brother brays upon this beach.
Then he' il get not one obol of Trojan tribute.
Helen?
Helen.
- Where is she?
- She' s not here, Paris.
Where?
She' s gone to the camp of the Greeks.
To Menelaus?
She was determined to end the destruction...... and restore you to the hearts of the Trojans.
- And you conspired with her -- - She was not a captive here, Paris...... but a woman of self- determination, a queen with more courage...... than I would have had to sail against the tides of heaven.
- He shan' t take her.
- The hour has passed, Paris.
You can' t prevent it.
Wait, Trojans.
You' ve returned the wife of Menelaus, but that isn' t all your debt.
Debt?
- We recognize no claim of debt.
Then who pays for the Greek blood shed on this plain?
Trojan blood has paid in full.
Trojan blood is not valid currency in Sparta...... nor does it pay for launching 1000 ships.
The terms of this truce were clear.
The return of Helen, in exchange for which...... you agreed to sail from these shores.
- You trusting fools.
- Two things only will suffice:
Half the treasury of Troy before we depart...... and after that, 1000 talents every year.
Take these nobles as security!
- Here' s payment, Menelaus!
- To the gates with her!
Bring her back to Troy!
Follow them!
After them!
Turn back!
Don' t go too close to the Trojan walls.
Not against Hector.
Patroclus!
Patroclus!
- Bring me my armor.
- Yes, master.
Thank you, Trojan, for bringing us the body of Patroclus.
Thank you very much.
My son, Greek treachery has proved that theirs is not a war of honor.
Helen, through you, we have learned that they seek plunder, not justice.
I ask forgiveness of you both.
Cassandra...... we have found there is great wisdom in you.
- What more can you tell us?
- New storms shall ride the sky...... but the guilt will be Athena' s, not Helen' s.
- Thank you, Cassandra.
- Such courage must not go unrewarded.
Helen, you will be a princess of Troy.
Where is Hector and Andromache?
They are to bestow the laurels.
Where is Hector?
By the Scaean gates, sire.
He anticipates a call to single combat for the death of Patroclus.
I killed him.
Any Greek challenge would come to me.
But Hector didn' t want you to be challenged by Achilles.
- He was devoted to Patroclus.
- Hector sent him his friend' s corpse...... with personal compliments.
No one can match Achilles, not even Hector.
This must not happen.
He cried like an animal in grief, my lord, and then called for his armor.
Ah, so he comes.
Hector!
Hector!
- It is done, Andromache.
- Achilles?
By his hand, my father and my brothers fell.
- While you live, I still have them in you.
- I intend to live, Andromache, for you...... and for our son.
This helmet always frightens him.
Let' s pray that he may never need one...... that he finds peace.
Arms to bear.
If Achilles wins, we move.
To the palace!
And if Achilles dies, we retire to consider a certain plan of mine.
- There' s an immortal shield around him.
- Mighty Zeus, help me find a weakness.
Achilles is dead!
So dies Greek courage, but not Greek cunning.
Defeated by men, deserted by the gods.
I used to number the months by a battle, a pestilence, a famine.
Now it' s all one long nightmare.
I fought wars since most of you were sucklings, but never one like this.
Let' s take our ships and sail back home.
That we shall do.
I have a plan that first required a Trojan victory.
- That much, at least, is accomplished.
- You speak treason.
As you will, but let' s be realistic.
The greatest army on Earth has lost its war.
What are you dreaming, Ulysses?
I' m dreaming of my wife, the good, constant Penelope.
- But how?
- Has this anything to do with the work...... that Apagos and his men have been doing in the woodlands?
They' re building a monument to the triumph of Paris and Helen.
A gift from the goddess Athena.
A sacred horse, so big and so beautiful...... that Troy cannot help taking it to her heart.
Remember, blow the retreat loud enough for Troy to hear.
Let the ships sail but keep sufficient force in the woodlands.
The ships will return at dawn.
Are you sure the Trojans will take this monstrosity into the city?
I promise.
Their gratitude to Athena for her victory will be tremendous.
And they' il give a loving welcome to her wondrous horse.
And to Bacchus, the god of grapes.
Make ready, men of Greece!
First they sounded retreat, and now the call to man the oars.
Their torches are moving back to the sea.
- Aboard the ships?
- We' il soon know.
Lord Aeneas has gone to the shore with scouts.
Sire, they' ve sailed.
The last of their ships has gone to sea.
Sound the cry!
Light the victory torch.
Carry it through the streets.
Good.
- Our heroes would wish us to rejoice.
- Light the victory torch!
You' il see a Troy you' ve never known before.
I see it in your faces.
Open it!
Open it!
Let us look at the world again!
Look, Priam.
I was trying to tell you of it, sire.
Some strange monument that the Greeks have left at our doorstep.
Beware the Greeks bearing gifts.
My sister speaks truly.
It is a thing of evil that should be burnt upon the plain.
I agree.
The enemy doesn' t give joyful presents.
My children, this is no gift from the Greeks...... but a symbol of worship they had to abandon.
Sire, the people beg permission to bring this amazing prize into the square.
They have fought long and bravely.
I cannot deny them.
Father, please hear me.
It is not the end of ruin, but the beginning.
We must not be ungrateful...... to a goddess who has proved herself our goddess.
Bring in her sacred horse.
It shall be a monument to Trojan valor.
Yes, sire.
It is a great and perfect thing.
How childish I was to have misgivings.
And I to be afraid of a wooden giant.
What was that for?
So forgiving of a rival goddess.
Are you jealous, Aphrodite?
I' m only Helen...... who wonders if she' il ever be a Trojan, really.
When the Trojan people look upon that plain...... won' t they always think of Helen of Sparta?
There is peace everywhere now.
We' re not bound to remain here.
Wherever you wish to go, Helen, I' il take you.
Hail to Prince Paris and his Helen!
Hail to Helen!
- All hail to Paris!
- Hail to Helen!
Destiny.
Not even from happiness.
No, and I am happy.
Very happy.
Men of Sparta, to the palace!
Forward!
Troy is lost, but you must not die.
While the Greeks plunder, make for the north gate.
- Do you think I would leave you now?
- Or I?
Obey your king.
Aeneas, take care of Andromache and my grandson.
Paris, Helen...... I command you, go.
Magnificent leadership, Agamemnon.
Athena will reward you with all the glory.
All of you, break in!
Helen!
Take them!
The rest of you, search!
Find her!
- Don' t let me get lost, Paris.
- Never.
Paris!
Paris!
Paris!
Paris!
Oh, Paris!
Paris!
Paris!
I thought I was lost!
The gods are with us.
Come.
Paris!
For a moment, I thought...
-... that you were that little slave girl.
Whatever your love wishes me to be, whatever is in your heart.
You are my heart.
Paris.
No.
My ship has returned for you.
Go there.
Wash his blood from you.
That can never be.
It' s my blood.
{y: i} It can 't be lost, Paris, can it?
{y: i} What has been lived {y: i} and shared is never lost.
{y: i} Never, Helen.
{y: i} Then this is not goodbye.
{y: i} And you with me.
Good God.
Matthew.
Matthew.
Matthew.
They say your whole life flashes before your eyes when you die.
And it' s true, even for a blind man.
I grew up in Hell' s Kitchen.
The politicians and the real- estate developers call it Clinton now.
Come on, hit me.
I' II give you a free shot.
- Hit him again.
- You fight Iike your dad.
- My dad' s gonna be champ.
- Your dad' s a bum.
- Yeah, a bum.
Hit me.
- Can' t fight.
- Pathetic.
My father was a boxer.
A sportswriter once wrote that he fought like the devil...... and the name stuck.
Jack "The Devil" Murdock was a contender.
But that was a long time ago.
Come on, Dad.
- Who won?
- Colan.
- I beat him, you know.
TKO.
And I beat Sharpman, Robbers, Wagner.
- Hey, hey, what' s that?
- Nothing.
I told you I didn' t want you fighting.
They said that you work for FaIlon.
Get over here.
Think I' d be puIling double overtime at the docks if I was working for FaIlon?
What are you, nuts?
You don' t hit nothing but books.
You be a doctor or a Iawyer.
- Dad....
- Matt, you can do it.
You can do anything if you' re not afraid.
Now, you promise me.
I promise, Dad.
One day, I took a shortcut home from school.
What I saw, I' il never forget...... because it would be the last thing I' d ever see.
I had other obligations.
- Dad?
- Okay, I got it.
Matt?
Matt!
I' m sorry, Matty.
I' m so sorry.
It' s okay, Dad.
It' s okay.
We made each other a silent promise...... to never give up.
To stick up for the long shots like us.
We were two fighters on the comeback trail.
I had lost my sight, but I got something back in return.
My remaining four senses functioned with superhuman sharpness.
But most amazing of all, my sense of sound gave off a kind of radar sense.
High above the roar of the streets, I trained my body and my senses.
An acute sense of touch gave me both strength and balance...... until the city itself became my playground.
I was the boy without fear.
Murdock!
Hey, Murdock!
- What' s up, freak?
- Look at him, man.
- Go ahead, fight me.
- Yeah, Murdock.
- I dare you.
Yeah, that' s what I' m saying, man.
Come on, man, Iet' s just go.
Okay.
Jack, it' s been a while.
- I don' t work for you no more, FaIlon.
- Jack, you never stopped.
Did you reaIly think you won those fights on your own?
You' re 42 years old.
They' re aII my fighters.
Just Iike you.
And now it' s your turn to take a faIl.
Think about your boy, Jack.
I' m sure you' il do the right thing.
No, come on, Dad!
Come on, Dad, get up!
Come on!
Come on, Dad.
Come on!
Get up!
Murdock, you aII right?
Okay, Iet' s fight.
Fight' s over.
Ladies and gentlemen, the winner, by way of knockout...... Jack "The Devil" Murdock!
This one was for you, Matty.
In some ways, I' m still waiting.
Finish him off.
Dad!
I can' t see you, Dad.
I can' t see you.
No one cared much about the death of a washed- up prizefighter.
Nobody but me.
I would seek justice.
Ladies and gentlemen, justice is blind...... but it can be heard.
And today, the truth wiII come out.
Mr. Quesada, would you state for the court...... the sequence of events Ieading up to the night of June 30?
I stopped off at Josie' s Bar after work.
Angela was there.
She asked me if I wanted to stick around for some fun.
Anything that happened after that was entirely consensual.
Objection.
My client' s a respectable member of the community.
- Miss Sutton has a history of drug -- - My client' s not on trial.
- Her testimony is suspect -- - Nor is her testimony suspect.
Gentlemen, that' s enough.
Miss Sutton enjoyed every minute of it.
Mr. Quesada, for your sake, I hope justice is found here today...
... before justice finds you.
Yeah?
Here' s what I don' t get.
He can' t.
The Kingpin' s gotta be footing the biIl.
- Come on.
Let' s go get drunk.
I got work to do.
Of course I beat it.
Kingpin' s got my back, bro.
- Boss?
- What' s up with that?
- Is that guy for real?
Yeah, he' s for real.
- What do you want?
- Justice.
Oh, God.
Oh, God!
How you doing?
- Didn' t you hear?
- I was acquitted.
- Not by me.
Hey, that Iight at the end of the tunnel?
That' s not heaven.
I' II kiII you!
- That' s the C train.
- I' II kiII you!
Hey, you can' t go past there.
- Right.
You' re wasting your time, Urich.
There' s nothing to see here.
Jose Quesada.
And the rest of Jose Quesada.
- Whole Iot of nothing, huh?
- Keep running those stories...... and we' II end up with copycat vigilantes who' II get themselves kiIled.
Are you here to confirm that DaredeviI is responsible for this, detective?
Stop busting my --
There is no proof that your so- caIled DaredeviI was involved...... nor that he even exists.
Got it?
Got it.
Can one man make a difference?
And others when I have lost all faith.
Are you there?
Of course you' re not there.
At least not for me.
Look, I didn 't want to do this over the phone...... but it' s not like you' ve given me any choice.
It' s been three months now, and I' ve never even seen your apartment.
Every time we sleep together, I wake up in the morning alone.
I mean, Jesus, where do you go at 3: 00 in the morning?
I thought that if I waited, if I was patient enough, you' d let me in.
Then I realized that this is the next level.
Goodbye, Matt.
I hope you find what you' re looking for.
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
- It' s been a week since -- - What are you playing at, Matt?
You didn' t come here for forgiveness.
You want permission, and I can' t give you that.
- Justice isn' t a sin, Father.
- No, but vengeance is.
Violence just begets more violence.
Is that how you want to Iive your Iife?
Is that what you want?
- Somebody has to do something.
- WeIl, why you?
Because I' m not afraid.
- WeIl, I' m afraid for you, Matthew.
Look, a man without fear is a man without hope.
May God have mercy on you, forgive you and grant you everlasting Iife.
I' m not too crazy about the outfit either.
"Eyewitnesses say Quesada was singled out...... by the demonic vigilante known as the Daredevil."
- I don' t know why you read that.
- There' s gotta be something to it.
- Like the aIligators in the sewers?
- There are aIligators in the sewers.
- A friend in sanitation has seen them.
- Fine.
They got this picture.
- They have a picture?
- It' s a drawing, an artist' s rendering.
It' s just -- It' s grotesque.
I' d hate to see his therapy biIls.
- Great.
You should be very happy.
Fluke is a fish.
I guess it' s --
I salsa dance on weekends, but I don' t shake my ass to pay my phone biIl.
WiII you pass the honey, please?
I' m tired of pro bono cases.
What is your problem with our clients?
We have good, honorable clients.
Define "better."
- What would be a better client?
- Better means rich and guilty, okay?
Law schooI taught us to create a moraI vacuum...... so you can represent people who aren' t innocent.
- That was your best course, as I recaIl.
- You don' t have a moraI vacuum.
You are completely vacuum- Iess.
Where?
Where?
- Front door.
Not yet, soon.
Now.
TeII me.
- You want the truth?
- Absolutely.
She' s hideous.
I don' t know if it' s a fungus or some congenitaI birth defect...... but as your attorney in this matter, I advise you to take no further action.
Excuse me.
Could you help me out?
Right in front of you.
WeIl, could you be a Iittle bit more specific?
- What are you --?
- Blind?
Yeah.
- That' s okay.
- Friend of yours?
- You know, I' ve never seen him before.
Matt Murdock.
- Nice to meet you, Matt Murdock.
- Nice to meet you.
I didn' t get your name.
I didn' t give it.
Some people have no compassion for the handicapped.
Apparently not.
- Where you going?
- I' m gonna file an appeal.
We have to be in court by noon.
- 1 2: 00, Matt.
- I' II be there.
What do you want?
I didn' t want trouble.
Look...... I don' t Iike being foIlowed.
Take it easy.
I don' t Iike being touched.
Why don' t you teII me what you do Iike, and we' II start there.
Sure you' re blind?
Sure you don' t wanna teII me your name?
- You' re holding back.
- Yes.
Don' t.
Does every guy have to go through this to find out your name?
Try asking for my number.
Stop hitting me.
Okay.
My name' s Elektra Natchios.
- What' s wrong, Wesley?
- Have you seen the papers today?
Somebody' s been talking.
Somebody always does.
Natchios, my dear, old friend.
I' m getting out, Wilson.
You think it' s funny?
They' re writing about the Kingpin.
They' re going back to the beginning.
WeIl, I' m tired of Iooking over my shoulder.
I want to put that behind me.
I want you to buy me out.
I think you' II find it' s a very generous offer.
So, what do you say?
How' s your daughter?
- I....
I' m not gonna Iie and say it doesn' t hurt.
- Where did you Iearn to fight Iike that?
He had me study with a different sensei every year since I was 5.
Sounds Iike he wanted to turn you into some kind of a warrior.
Just not a victim.
- Watch your step.
I didn' t even --
Wait.
How did you do the park?
I don' t know, growing up in the Kitchen, a blind kid.
See that?
I want you to create a paper trail, one that can be traced to Natchios.
So I' II give them a kingpin.
Get me BuIlseye.
Two out of three.
Bloody Irish piece of trash.
- I said I was sorry.
- Details.
Her name' s Elektra Natchios.
She sounds Iike a Mexican appetizer.
It' s Greek, genius.
Her father' s Nikolaos Natchios.
- Yeah, see.
Yes, the biIlionaire.
As your attorney, I advise you to marry her immediately.
I' II take it under consideration.
Susie is my son Larry' s daughter by his first marriage.
She eloped with this semi- colored feIlow from London.
Just Iet' s say he had a Iittle cream in his coffee.
But he did very weII for himself on the Internet.
You know, they did get me a computer for Christmas Iast year...... but I refuse.
So I said --
She' s sleeping.
Can I get you anything before we Iand?
More peanuts, please.
- Thanks, buddy.
How can you not remember the Kingpin?
What are you, stupid?
You think you could hold out on the Kingpin?
Get away from me!
Stay out of HeIl' s Kitchen.
This ain' t your neighborhood no more.
Please.
Please don' t hurt me.
I' m not the bad guy, kid.
I' m not the bad guy.
I' m not.
I have to caII you back because he just came in.
- Your ears must have been burning.
- Why?
This just came by messenger.
Plus one.
Plus one?
AII right.
Guess I gotta rent a tux.
They spent some serious money on this invitation.
It' s engraved.
- What time are you gonna pick me up?
- I' m not going.
What?
Are you crazy?
Or with wheels of cheese.
I' m gonna fiII you in on a secret.
It Iooks Iike the set of Sanford and Son.
I' m waiting for Lamont to walk in.
- Then you go.
I' m a plus- one.
Plus- ones don' t get anywhere alone.
Are you finished?
We only have an hour to prepare for court.
What' s eating you?
Rough night.
WeIl, you want to talk about it?
- It' s about Elektra, isn' t it?
Natchios owns The Grand Hotel, and Elektra' s the reason you were invited.
She' s out of my Ieague, and I' d rather end it before it starts.
That' s gotta be some record.
Trying to save some time?
What happens to that Iie detector of yours when it detects your own buIl?
Let' s reaIly bury the needle, huh?
Look, Matt, seriously, the baIl' s in your court.
So does this mean you want a rematch?
I knew I' d find you.
How did you know I wasn' t a mugger?
At Ieast this far from Chelsea.
Come here.
Wait a second.
Exactly how many women have you brought up here, anyway?
You' re my first.
- Good answer.
- I thought that was the right answer.
Look at this.
I know.
This was my favorite view of the city when I was a kid.
I reaIly wanted you to see this.
What' s this?
That' s from my mother.
- It' s beautiful.
It' s a good- Iuck charm, huh?
Do they make them in BraiIle?
She gave it to me right before she died.
What happened?
- No.
- No, I' m gonna go -- - Wait, wait, wait.
- It is.
I' m teIling you, it' s --
The temperature dropped two or three degrees.
I can smeII the moisture.
And when it rains, it' s Iike there' s a rooftop on the world.
Each raindrop makes a sound the first time it faIls on a surface.
It' s Iike I can see again.
I just wanna see you.
Okay.
Look, here it comes.
My God.
You are so beautiful.
- What?
That' s my car!
- Matt?
- I' m sorry.
- I have to go.
Stay with me.
This is what I' m talking about.
Aren' t you happy you Iistened to me?
This is gonna be great for business.
Thank you.
Matt Murdock.
Ben Urich, New York Post.
You write articles about urban Iegends, right?
WeIl, yes, among other things.
You know the aIligators in the sewers?
I foIlowed that piece you wrote about the Kingpin.
One man running aII the crime in New York City sounds a Iittle far- fetched.
Yeah, but, then again, so does a vigilante who thinks every day is HaIloween.
They gotta be huge by now, right, the aIligators?
It' s a myth.
Sorry.
CooI color.
I wouldn' t know.
There' s something I' d Iike to talk to you about.
Enjoy the party.
Wilson Fisk is in the hizzey.
Come on, Iet' s go.
- Mr. Fisk.
It' s Franklin Nelson from Nelson & Murdock --
Hey, yeah, you wanna talk to Mr. Fisk, you make an appointment.
- Wesley.
You' re the blind Iawyers from HeIl' s Kitchen.
Right.
I' m deaf.
Give them a card, Wesley.
I' m always on the Iookout for new blood.
My partner is a Iittle overzealous.
And why is that?
Yes, why is that, Mr. Murdock?
Because we only handle clients who are innocent.
"Innocent," he said.
I' ve Iearned one thing in my years in this business.
What' s that?
Nobody.
- Have a great time at the party.
I just....
Matt, I just wish I could give you my eyes for one night.
- It' s Iike that?
- It' s Iike that.
You want me to take you up there, Matt?
Matt?
Matt?
Now I found you.
That' s aII that matters.
Hi.
HeIlo.
You Iook beautifuI tonight.
Do you mind?
That' s aIl.
Not me.
But you should know...... that the only reason I got dressed up for this thing...... was that I wanted to Iook beautifuI for you.
I wish you could see me tonight.
Me too.
Matt.
What' s wrong?
... good things don' t happen to me very often.
When they do, I get scared.
Nothing bad is gonna happen.
Promise.
Doesn' t she Iook beautiful?
I think she' s happy.
I haven' t seen her smile Iike that since before her mother was kiIled.
Right in front of her eyes.
What, you have to bring that up now?
History has a way of repeating itself.
- What are you saying?
- Just saying goodbye, old friend.
Just saying goodbye.
- Something' s happening.
Papa!
TeII me where you' re going.
I' m sorry.
- New York is not a safe place tonight.
That' s aII you need to know.
I never miss.
Drop something?
BuIlseye.
Hey, Nick.
What do you want, Urich?
Does aII this make you happy?
Looks Iike you got your story.
You were right.
- I know how you feel.
- You don' t know how I feel.
I want revenge.
Revenge won' t make the pain go away.
I know.
There' s no place for me now.
Yes, there is.
Stay with me.
Please.
Elektra.
Elektra, wait.
Please.
Drive.
This better be good, Kirby.
You know me, Urich.
It' s always good.
Come on.
Are you ready to see something reaIly, reaIly cool?
- Come on.
- Give me my money.
- Why?
Come on.
AII right.
WeIl, but have you seen this?
And tighty righty, Ioosey Ieft --
You said to Iook out for anything weird, yes?
Right?
You have no idea.
-- will identify Natchios as the so- called Kingpin. -- believes that the self- styled vigilante is wanted for murder. -- implication of Daredevil.
How did you get past my security?
You mean that guy?
Necessary?
No, it was fun.
You know, you' ve exceeded aII my expectations.
You even managed to implicate DaredeviI in the process.
You should be pleased.
... miss.
There' s an old saying that too much pride can kiII a man.
The deviI is mine.
I' ve heard that before, aII too many times.
How do you kiII a man without fear?
By putting the fear in him.
I Iike that.
But first...
... give Elektra aII my best.
Is there anything else?
Yeah.
I want a bloody costume.
What do you want?
- I know who it is.
What do you want?
I got a Iead on my story.
Why are you teIling me this?
They say the Kingpin doesn' t just kiII you.
He kiIls your whole family.
I think your girl' s in trouble.
I thought you might know somebody that could protect her.
Remember me?
Wait!
It wasn' t me.
It was a hit man named BuIlseye.
- I didn' t kiII your father.
- Liar.
I want to Iook into the eyes of my father' s kiIler as he dies.
Now you know.
I was just trying to protect you, Elektra.
- I' m sorry.
That' s BuIlseye.
- He has to pay for what he' s done.
- No, you don' t understand.
I don' t want to Iose you again.
I' II find you.
Hey, orphan.
Let' s play.
Come on.
I' II give you that.
... I' m magic.
And now for my next trick.
N. Y. P. D. Aviation.
Get on your knees and put your hands on your head.
I repeat, get on your knees and put your hands on your head.
Help me.
Just stay with me.
Everything' s clear.
Matthew.
Matthew.
Oh, my God.
I tried, Father.
I tried.
- This is who I am.
- Is that a fact?
First one' s a warning...
... Padre.
- Yeah.
- Take it.
- What about you?
- I have to finish this.
Have faith, Father.
Isn' t that right?
You.
Let' s play.
Kane, I want the blueprints and the city grids.
- Yes, sir.
- Where the heIl' s my SWAT team?
- Which one?
Both of them.
I want a man on that roof.
Ready?
The man without fear.
Looks Iike I found something you' re afraid of.
Let' s bring on the pain.
Let' s bring on the noise.
Fisk was right about you.
Fisk?
Fisk is the Kingpin?
Yeah.
The whole red rose thing, he Ioves that shit.
He hired me to kiII Natchios.
And to gut your pretty girlfriend too.
But me, I' m going for the hat trick.
I told him I' d do you for free.
The deviI is mine.
Oh, my hands!
My hands.
You took away my hands.
Show mercy.
BuIl' s- eye.
- Freeze!
Detective, Iook!
Good Iuck, son.
There' s been a problem.
BuIlseye failed.
Correct.
Send the guards home.
- But, sir -- - I was raised in the Bronx, Wesley.
This is something you wouldn' t understand.
Daredevil.
Kingpin.
It' s a shame you came here wounded.
I would have loved to fight you in your prime.
They caII you the man without fear.
If that' s true, why are you afraid to show your face?
I don' t believe it.
The blind Iawyer from HeIl' s Kitchen?
You kiIled the only two people I ever loved.
Why?
Business.
That' s aII it ever is, business.
I was working for FaIlon at the time.
Your father was supposed to throw a fight...... and your girI was in the wrong family at the wrong time.
I' il find you.
You' ve been in my business for too Iong.
I' ve been thinking about this day since I was 1 2 years old.
I don' t understand.
I' m not the bad guy.
The sirens.
They' re coming for you.
For me?
Didn' t you hear?
The word' s out on the Kingpin.
They' re coming for you.
I can hear the police radios from here.
I swear I' II teII them who you are.
Go ahead, teII them.
TeII the guys at Riker' s aII about how you got beat by a blind man.
It' II be Iike blood in the water.
Don' t worry about that, because I' II get out.
And I' II be waiting.
Justice is served.
I' II get you.
It' s not over with yet.
This is for you, Dad.
"Though there were no witnesses, police think DaredeviI brought Fisk to justice."
There were no eyewitnesses.
How can you be a skeptic?
If there' s no eyewitnesses -- Bigfoot has eyewitnesses.
- The aIligators in the sewers --
I didn' t admit that.
I' m explaining --
Do you concede that there are aIligators in the sewers?
- Answer the question.
How can you not concede?
How you doing?
I' m doing okay.
You wanna talk about it?
No, but thanks.
- I got this.
I had set out to save the city...... but with Elektra 's help, I saved myself instead.
Now I have faith that anything is possible.
BraiIle.
And some days, faith is all you need.
Soon the world will know the truth:
That this is a city born of heroes.
That one man can make a difference.
Go get them, Matt.
Hell' s Kitchen is my neighborhood.
I prowl the rooftops and alleyways at night...... watching from the darkness.
Forever in darkness...... a guardian devil.
"Information"... the very nature of the word is beginning to change.
The world is shrinking.
Borders are collapsing... cultures are growing closer and closer day by day.
Information is the new unexplored frontier.
And in the forefront of this new age is, of course... the Internet.
Are you sure this is a big story?
"Scoop," Joaquim.
And, yeah, I' m sure.
Well...
Hank, you' re my hero.
- Hey, where are you going?
- Press.
Do you have an appointment?
That' s news.
You need an appointment to get in.
7tv, Hank Robinson, right there.
Okay, rock and roll.
- Public broadcasting?
- Is that a problem?
Take it easy, Hank.
I' m not going to take it easy.
I don' t need this guy keeping me out of here... because he doesn' t like the company I' m working for.
How come he waltzes through?
Señor Aribau has the exclusive rights to all Nova communications.
The number of people who get their news from the Internet... as opposed to, you know, TV or newspapers... grows by 1 million worldwide each year.
One million.
Just follow my lead, and it' il be fine, okay?
Good morning, Christina, you look beautiful.
Can I see the boss?
Just a minute, please.
The conclusion is obvious.
He who controls the Internet... controls information.
In the last three years, Nova communications... have carved a widening niche in the telecommunications market.
Well, I believe it' s time we expanded.
Did you call the press, Señor Pla?
No, I did not.
If you think something newsworthy is going to happen today... you are very much mistaken.
You may be our main stockholder, but I' m still president of this company.
Nothing will change that.
Hank Robinson reporting from Barcelona.
I am standing in front of the headquarters of Nova... the fastest growing telecommunications company in Spain.
Today, majority shareholder Manuel Pla is challenging Nova president Sert... inside the boardroom, while I stand out here in the parking lot.
Come on, let' s go again.
Take two.
What' s this?
This is my offer, Señor Sert.
Quite generous, I think.
You' re trying to buy me out?
We get a two- shot and we go to lunch, okay?
On the floor.
Now!
- Don' t move!
- Oh, no!
What the hell is that?
What the hell is going on here?
- What' s the meaning of this?
- Oh, my God!
Jesus Christ!
Let' s go.
Go where?
- In there, where the story is.
Someone with a gun.
- Give me the camera.
- No!
Fine.
Nothing is worth dying for, man.
- Call the police, I' m going in.
- Hank.
- Who are you people?
- We are Anarchy Now.
Your company spreads lies to confuse innocent people.
Gunfire at the Nova offices.
Always make sure there' s film in the camera.
You support the capitalist pigs.
This is your reward.
All of you, get out of here!
Come on, run!
Run!
Tell everyone the truth.
Boss!
Listen, call Veronica.
Tell her I' ve got footage of Sert' s murder.
Acts of terror have become so commonplace in our age... that we run the risk of becoming used to their images... to becoming desensitised to them.
The day that these shocking, horrific images fail to appal us... is the day that we begin to lose some of our humanity.
Let' s let these images speak for themselves.
I, for one, will not soon forget them.
- My favourite part' s coming up.
- This is Hank Robinson reporting... with a 7tv news exclusive.
And we' re out.
Pure genius.
It helps to have the hottest producer in town.
They want to licence your video.
- Bleed them dry.
- And our ratings are climbing.
We got 20 share tonight.
Thousands of people tuned in.
- How does it feel being a star?
- Twenty share?
Speaking as your producer, I' m thrilled.
Speaking as your girlfriend... don' t ever risk your life like that again.
With great risks come great rewards.
What you did was the most inspiring thing I' ve ever seen.
Veronica.
That tape...
The thing is...
- I just -- - Proved to the world... what I' ve always known.
You' re the real deal, Hank.
I love you.
And I don' t want to lose you.
I love you, too.
I have to rinse.
Yes, I understand all that, but just get him for me.
At 3: 00, you' re interviewing Cardinal Rosselli.
- I thought he never meets the press.
- He agreed to talk to you.
This is a real scoop.
Ronnie.
I' m getting audio interference on Camera 2.
- Interference?
- Either God' s talking to us... or it' s someone' s cell phone.
His polls are rather low.
Can' t you see the sign?
I' m most terribly sorry.
Very thoughtless of me.
Nicola, I' il have to call you back.
And you are Veronica Nadal.
1999?
'98, actually.
I' m here to see Mr. Robinson.
So, this is 7tv.
Well, it' s quaint.
Is your studio fully soundproof?
Of course.
Some of the equipment has been here since the '60s.
That' s all, it needs to be replaced.
A journalist of Mr. Robinson' s stature deserves better.
We are only a local station, we take what we can get.
- Jordi, what the hell are you doing?
- Sorry, Miss Nadal.
You can start by replacing him.
Excuse me.
Archie McGovern, owner --
Pleasure, sir.
Pleasure to meet you.
I' m sorry, this will have to wait.
Hank goes on in 10 minutes.
Have you met Veronica, my producer?
And I will only take five.
You have to forgive her.
She' s a little protective.
And rightly so.
You' re her gold mine.
So that' s McGovern.
Seems like a nice guy.
Yeah, that' s just what they said about Hitler.
Let' s get Hank' s sound levels up.
- WeIl, we did start 7tv together.
- It' s kind of our baby.
Scrimping and scavenging for every cent... hunting down stories, hoping and praying for the exclusive... that would put you on the map.
I know it very well.
So tell me, Hank, how many viewers does 7tv get a week?
100, 000?
55, 000, sir.
Vision TV... is watched by 10 million people every night, and growing.
I know, sir.
What can I do for you?
Mr. Robinson, I' m here on a rather serious matter.
Did you know that he worked for me?
Yes, he was a wonderful reporter.
He' il be missed.
On the morning of the Nova attack, I sent Carlos to interview Señor Sert... and then, your story came to my attention.
Mr. Robinson, you represent...
Well, Hank, you represent everything... that Vision TV has come to stand for.
And I would like you to join our family.
I beg your pardon?
That' s right, Hank, your gravy train has come in.
I' m going to have to talk to someone about that.
I understand.
I' m sure she will realise what a grand opportunity this is for you.
- Bring her along if you like.
- Thank you, sir.
Of course he wants to hire you.
Guys like McGovern are afraid of guys like you.
McGovern, he reports the official story.
- He gets us into 10 million households.
- Yeah, but at what price?
My father worked for 10 years before the networks called... and when they did, he jumped at it.
Hank, we are so close to achieving everything we wanted.
- Don' t throw away our independence.
- This is a good thing.
- You made a decision like that without me?
- I' m your partner, I' m your girlfriend.
- They promised to hire you.
I already have everything I' ve ever wanted.
At least, I thought I did.
Veronica, please sit down.
Women.
- Let me buy you a drink.
- No, I got to go.
I think you' re doing the right thing.
Vision TV, man.
That' s a big time.
- Yeah.
- Need a cameraman?
I' il bet they probably do.
I' il ask them, all right?
You do that.
- Hank.
- Yeah?
My camcorder... the one you filmed your Nova story with.
Sure it was.
No, it wasn' t.
I number all my tapes.
It was empty.
What' s your point?
Just share the wealth, you know?
I' m a talented guy, and I' m shooting porn to make ends meet.
It' s a fucking crime.
Are you blackmailing me?
No, I would never do that.
We' re friends, right?
- Yeah.
- Friends do friends favours.
- Sure they do.
- So, good karma.
- Oh, yeah.
- We understand each other.
- Terrific.
I' il be seeing you, Hank.
Hey, hombre, that' s my beer.
Hey, Hank!
Partners forever!
Okay.
I can' t get this all done.
No, you' re not listening to me.
Birth of a Nation:
The Founding of Iran by Howard Robinson.
Barcelona School of Journalism.
I' m your assistant.
This is my first job.
Hello, Marisa.
It' s my first time having an assistant.
Miss Markham is waiting for you in the newsroom.
- Of course, Nicola Markham.
- Yeah, she' s our news director.
All right, the Chinese plan to have a man on the moon by the end of the year.
Right, if their entire population stands on each other' s shoulders.
- You' re late.
- Sorry, I didn' t realise there was a meeting.
News happens every day, Robinson, and every day we report it.
That' s why we are called a news service.
Eduardo, the Chinese astronaut is yours, a present from me.
And next, in Africa, AlDS epidemic is at an all- time high.
Katrina, you run with that.
And in local news, Barcelona is once again in the Champion' s League.
Make it the lead story.
Okay, what are you waiting for?
Impress me.
- Not so fast, Robinson.
- Call me Hank.
Robinson, how the hell did you end up in Spain?
I thought there were more career opportunities in Europe.
Meaning you couldn' t cut it stateside.
If you want to last here, you will follow instructions, claro?
- Claro.
- Good.
Manuel Pla set his sights on his main rival, Intertel.
If Pla succeeds in purchasing Intertel... he will have a virtual monopoly on the telecommunications market.
- Precisely.
I want you to interview Eloy Agustin, the head of Intertel.
Find out why he won' t sell, and what he intends to do about it.
- No, ma' am.
Good.
I was in Tehran with your father during the revolution.
You look a lot like him.
I hope I' m half the reporter he was.
Careful what you wish for.
Señor Agustin, you' re dealing with a hostile takeover bid from Nova.
How are you planning to deal with the threat?
I have faith in the loyalty of my stockholders.
They realise Nova is trying to force everyone out of business.
That may be, but we deal in a free market society.
Can you really fault them their success?
Think of a world in which one company provided every service.
Without competition, there is no need to maintain quality, or accountability.
The Internet should be free.
Unregulated.
Thank you, sir.
This is Hank Robinson reporting from Intertel.
We have the edit suite booked for noon... so with any luck, we should be done tomorrow afternoon.
- Are you enjoying your new job?
- I am, yes.
Your predecessor, Carlos Aribau, was a friend of mine.
- Was he?
- Did you know him?
Our paths crossed briefly.
- Thank you.
Good luck.
I hope this business doesn' t victimise you the way it did Carlos.
What do you mean?
You know what it' s like... trying to weed out the liars from the honest men.
Not even his best friends.
- Did I wake you?
Who' s this?
Hurry up.
I' m not going anywhere until you tell me your name.
Nova, Hank.
The Anarchist attack, remember?
You went out there and got the story.
What do you want?
45 minutes.
And, hey, make sure there' s film in the camera this time, okay?
Nothing personal.
You' ve seen too much.
Señor Agustin... wants you dead.
- Of course.
He got uptight... claimed his private life was nobody' s business.
Sounds like he doesn' t know this girl is a killer.
He' s hiding it.
- Conjecture.
- It all fits.
Who did the terrorists attack?
Who benefits?
Agustin.
- Talk about aggressive business practices.
We operate on facts.
I saw her face.
Your word isn' t proof.
You need corroboration.
Nicola may be a bit overzealous at times, but she has a point.
- Looking forward to seeing it.
- You' il have to excuse me.
- Thank you for your time.
Manuel Pla.
I recognise you from TV.
- And the lovely...
Marisa is my assistant.
- Pleasure.
- Congratulations.
Your company' s fortunes have really turned around.
He made us famous.
And if we succeed on acquiring Intertel...
- Enjoy yourselves.
- Thank you.
Would you like a drink?
Sure.
Scotch is great, thanks.
Hi.
How are things?
I mean, sure, we' re in a ratings slump right now... but we' il turn it around.
I' ve met a few young reporters with a lot of potential.
You look beautiful.
So, that' s your date?
Yes, she' s my intern.
- Is that what they call it now?
I miss you.
A lot.
Talk?
I' ve left some of my things at your place.
Anytime.
I' ve got a story to cover.
TV.
It must have been scary.
- What' s that?
- Alone, filming the Anarchists.
They weren' t just angry young kids with cap guns.
Top- of- the- line Uzis, classic commando assault.
I' d say they had training, financing, backing.
Someone developed Anarchists Now.
And that someone is running the show.
I' m sorry, I didn' t get your name.
I' m a cop.
Brechner, Interpol.
- On duty?
- Always, keeping an eye on things.
Don' t want a repeat of the Nova incident, do we?
Agent Brechner, you mind if I ask you a few questions?
- You on duty?
- Always.
Why not?
You identified any of the anarchists?
We have our suspicions.
One of them is a woman.
- You know her name?
- Do you?
My bosses won' t let me run it until I get corroboration.
- If I show you a picture, can you confirm it?
- You can' t name me.
Anonymous source.
What do you need?
Her name is Leila Krtolica.
Anarchy Now' s aim is to create chaos... to destabilise governments, eventually create a new world order.
Businesses represent capitalism to them, their most hated enemy.
Already this year they' ve claimed 28 victims.
Leila made Interpol' s most- wanted in June.
- Now she' s in Spain.
- But what' s her connection to Agustin?
Terrorists need funding.
It' s hard to blow up bombs on an empty stomach.
You tell me Eloy Agustin is a sponsor of terrorism?
According to my Interpol source.
They' ve been watching him for years.
Looks like you' ve got your corroboration, Nicola.
Okay, Robinson.
Impress me.
What is the connection between Anarchy Now operative Leila Krtolica... and Eloy Agustin of Intertel?
Agustin' s greatest rival.
Coincidence?
Señor Agustin has denied any connection with any terrorist group... and maintains he is the victim of a frame- up.
Cut.
- Thoughts?
- Not bad.
You don' t want to hurt yourself praising.
You did your job.
What do you want, a cookie?
We' il lead with it tonight.
Happy?
Jesus, Veronica, I thought you were looking for...
- So what are you doing here?
- I told you, I left some things behind.
I still have my key.
Which reminds me.
So long, Hank.
I' m sorry.
I' m just...
Sorry, I' m a little high- strung lately.
I saw your report tonight.
- You watch Vision TV?
- Only when you' re on.
- And?
- You did good.
Thanks.
Careful, Hank.
I am humbled by the trust I' ve been given in being appointed Nova' s new CEO.
I vow to lead Nova and its new acquisitions... with integrity and vision, into a prosperous future.
In the furore following the allegations surrounding Eloy Agustin last week...
Intertel stockholders voted unanimously to sell their company to Manuel Pla.
Señor Agustin, meanwhile... is under investigation by the Chief Magistrate' s office.
This is Hank Robinson with Vision TV signing off.
Didn' t your father ever teach you to keep your powder dry?
Your story on Agustin caused quite a stir.
I' ve had the Chief Magistrate on the line all morning.
Just the result of good journalism, I guess, sir.
Yes.
Free publicity is priceless.
Actually, I was thinking more about the social value.
We exposed killers.
Ever wonder what a limey like me was doing in Spain?
I love it.
It' s waiting to be developed.
It' s too knowing.
And together we going to make this city the centre for world news.
And I have faith in you.
We' re onto something wonderful.
You can' t learn to be a journalist from a book.
Didn' t they teach you anything at school?
Yes.
We had a saying.
"Believe nothing of what you hear, and half of what you see."
That' s a good motto.
Hello?
Yes, he is.
Hold, please.
You' ve got a call on Line 1.
Thank you.
Good morning, partner.
Caught your piece last night.
Good job.
You going to give me your name this time?
Call me Crusader.
Okay, Crusader... how did you know that Agustin was sponsoring terrorism?
A magician never explains his tricks.
Listen... why me?
You' re a rising star, Hank.
You could go far.
I look forward to working with you for a very long time.
Listen, how do I get a hold of you if I need you?
You were handed the story on a silver platter.
- What are you complaining about?
- I don' t trust him, or like him.
You' re beginning to sound like Carlos Aribau.
What?
Okay, I know what this is about: fear of success.
You' re on the verge of surpassing your father...
- and the thought of it scares you.
- Bullshit.
Just do your job!
Here, another early story by Carlos Aribau.
Anything interesting?
Local news, some crimes, some human interests.
You' re a walking encyclopaedia, Marisa.
Listen... - how did Aribau make it big?
Something really big.
Out of nowhere?
He never revealed who it was.
Probably never knew.
After that big story that make him famous... he was offered a job at Vision TV, and the rest is history.
That first big job?
Industrial espionage.
Some telecommunications companies has been accused of violating antitrust laws.
Aribau would champion their cause and prove their innocence.
I was in high school, but I remember it was a big deal at the time.
Manuel Pla.
Manuel Pla would have been ruined, but Aribau saved him.
Over and over...
Pla benefited.
Señor Agustin?
Señor Agustin, we need to talk.
This is my home.
I founded this company, and you...
- You took it away!
- We were set up.
The both of us.
Now, how did you meet the girl?
She came up to me, at the conference.
She was interested!
You are a man.
A woman that beautiful is interested in you, do you chase her away?
She said you wanted me dead.
And you believed it.
You, the great reporter!
I made a mistake.
I' ve been in business for a very long time.
This isn' t over yet.
Tell me what you know.
I asked my own questions, hired my own investigators.
She' s no terrorist.
She' s a cold, methodical killer.
- She' il kill for you if the price is right.
- Are you telling me she' s a mercenary?
They call them "security contractors."
Manuel Pla?
- Pla?
Others behind him.
Tell me.
God, it' s them.
You brought them here!
Señor Agustin.
No!
You did all you could, Mr. Robinson.
You are a hero.
A hero would have saved him.
Two assailants, one male, one female.
Anything you can remember about them?
The motorcycle mask.
I' m sorry.
One moment, please.
- Robinson.
- Don' t say another word.
Are you all right?
- Everything is fine.
- Yeah, everything is fine.
- It' s an important call.
- It' s an important call.
Take your time.
Listen, you son of a bitch, I am onto you.
You set up Agustin.
Don' t be so melodramatic.
Take a deep breath, calm down.
Do you understand?
I don' t exist, Hank.
I' m a whisper, a breath on the other end of the line.
You set up Agustin and you set me up.
You want me dead next?
I do hope it doesn' t come to that.
I' m enjoying our relationship.
I have many, many more stories to tell you.
You can' t manipulate me.
I' m not Carlos Aribau.
No, you' re worse.
Carlos never stepped on corpses to get a story.
- McGovern.
- Hank!
- Listen to me.
Agustin has been murdered.
He was strangled, and left hanging like a piece of meat.
- Yes.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
- What?
They found a note in his home, and there is an eyewitness.
What are you talking about?
I saw it, I was there.
All right, Hank, I believe you... but this is a news service.
You' il never get this past Nicola without proof.
Markham.
What time did it happen?
Take it easy.
It' s about Agustin --
Feeling the unyielding hand of the law closing in on him... and filled with remorse over his terrorist activity... he lynched himself.
McGovern scooped you.
But... how did he know?
Veronica?
Okay, come on, everybody, run!
Give me the fucking gun!
Veronica, hi, it' s me.
Listen, can you meet me at the station?
So, Hank, how are they treating you at Vision TV?
- Can' t complain.
'Cause we don' t.
- Pedro.
- Did they give you an assistant?
- Yeah.
- Is she a babe?
Pedro, the tape.
Well, the tracking' s screwed up.
- Was the camera damaged in any way?
- Well...
We could dump both picture and sound on a computer... and run a component program.
The computer would digitally adjust the tracking.
It could clean up over 90% of your sound and image.
- How long is that going to take?
Do it.
Now, about your assistant?
Thank you very much.
She' s a slave master.
You' re lucky you escaped when you did.
Let me see if I understand.
The Anarchy Now attack... it was all a ploy to disguise Sert' s murder.
They killed the president of Nova so that Manuel Pla could take over... and they framed Agustin so Pla could control Intertel, right?
You were a witness.
You saw everything.
- Why didn' t you expose them?
- I didn' t know what I had.
The first time I looked at the tape, it looked like a bunch of static.
What do you mean, "the first time"?
You shot this, didn' t you?
Whose tape is this?
Carlos Aribau' s.
Veronica, come on!
You robbed a dead man.
Have you no shame?
They examined the tape.
- Why didn' t they catch this?
- Because I gave them a dub.
I hid it.
- They are going to crucify you.
Why did you do it?
- Because...
all my life...
I was living in my father' s shadow.
All my life, I wanted to...
I just...
It was there.
I saw it.
It was in my hand, I just took it.
I just did it.
I just took it.
I' m not this guy.
I' m not.
Marisa.
Good luck.
Mr. McGovern?
I bet you think you' re quite the hotshot.
Is there a problem, sir?
You, Robinson, and your story.
Your story on Agustin put us at the top of the ratings.
Congratulations.
I know someone who' s going to be very happy with his Christmas bonus this year.
Thank you.
- Don' t mention it.
You know, maybe as a follow- up, you should do a story on Nova.
You know, how Manuel Pla saved the company after the terrorist attack... and turned its fortunes around.
Fair and balanced, of course.
- Of course.
- Good.
An Agent Brechner from Interpol called three times this morning.
"The Great Game."
It' s a term the British used during World War I for espionage.
They used people as game pieces and the world as a board.
Kind of like Monopoly.
Except in Monopoly, the game pieces don' t die.
- Listen, Agustin was murdered.
- I know.
There' s a new player in the game.
Six feet tall, German, very professional.
Listen, I' ve been getting calls, anonymous tips.
I' m thinking this Wolf may be using me somehow.
What?
I don' t know.
Goddamn terrorists.
Now they' ve joined the media.
Why didn' t you tell me sooner?
I' m a reporter.
I was hoping for a scoop.
Don' t be an idiot, Robinson.
These people will eat you for breakfast.
If they contact you again... please, let me know.
- Consider me...
- A friend?
I was going to say "ally."
Mr. Robinson?
Miss Markham told me to give this to you.
She wanted me to hand it to you directly.
She sounded very mysterious.
What is it?
The police report on Agustin' s death.
Who' s winning?
Would you get me another drink, please?
This is for VlPs only.
How did you get in here?
The security guard was female.
She was susceptible to my charm.
- Big fan, huh?
- He' s going to foul.
Yeah.
One could draw some startling conclusions.
- The police reports Agustin' s suicide...
- at five minutes to 1 1: 00 in the morning...
McGovern knew about this.
Our boss is involved in this.
Agustin never stood a chance.
- I' m glad you' re in this with me.
- No, you can count me out.
- These guys, they don' t blush at much.
- You scared?
If you were going to sit it out, why did you bait me?
You were hungry, out to get a name.
Here' s a story, now go fetch it.
So, I get my head blown off, and you sit behind your desk?
Hank, when you' ve seen what I' ve seen, and you' ve lived what I' ve lived... then you can judge me.
If I can help without exposing myself, I will.
It' s not big enough.
See you at the water cooler, Nicola.
Hello, Mr. Robinson.
lmagine running into you here.
Relax.
Perhaps we --
Yeah, but the only problem was he didn' t understand a word I was saying.
- Quite -- - So, what' s the joke?
- Hank, good to see you.
- Nice to see you.
Tell us what our star reporter has been up to.
What have I been up to?
Well, I was shot, chased, nearly killed.
How about you?
Murder any competitors lately?
Hank, why don' t I get you a drink?
Enjoy yourselves.
You' ve been reading too many spy novels, Hank.
How did you know what was in Agustin' s police report before it was issued?
I have an amazingly good contact in the Barcelona police force.
- Who?
- Hank!
A good reporter never reveals his sources.
- You' re lying.
- Am I?
Truth is in the eye of the beholder.
There is only one absolute truth:
Truth is power.
The anarchist attack on Nova.
Orchestrated to remove an obstacle... that stubborn old fool, Sert... and put Manuel Pla in charge.
- Framing Agustin?
- Another obstacle removed.
Now, Pla has his finger in the Internet and telecommunications pie.
Why are you doing this?
The Internet is dangerous.
It allows people to get information they cannot be trusted with.
It must be controlled... step by step.
Until, eventually, people like you are running the whole show.
I' m wondering what the Chief Magistrate is going to think about this.
Why don' t we ask him?
He' s one of my guests.
He' s right down there, see?
I believe you' ve already made his acquaintance.
Of course, we will have to tell him the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth... including your pilfering of the Aribau story.
Oh, yes, I knew all along.
That' s why I hired you.
Well, we' re the same, you and I.
Unbound by petty moral concepts of good and evil... we see what has to be done, and we do it.
- Men like us rule the world.
Yes.
We are governed only by our desires.
Me, it' s power.
For you, I' d say respect.
Look, the crime is not stealing the story, son.
The crime is getting caught.
So, why don' t we join the party?
There are some people I' d really like you to meet.
They, too, have done what it takes.
Triumph over Adversity.
I' m a whore.
- Mr. Robinson, you have a call on Line 1.
- Thank you.
- Robinson.
- It' s me.
We cleaned up the tracking.
- God, Hank.
Play it.
Stop it!
It' s enough!
What?
Did you have to make such a scene?
Nobody will suspect me.
He saw what we wanted him to see.
Oh, Jesus.
These people are savages.
We have to broadcast this, Hank.
All right, don' t do anything yet.
Just give me a little time, all right?
Okay.
Important call?
Don' t you knock?
So what' s the plan?
The plan?
Well, I thought I' d finish my puff piece on Manuel Pla... go down to the local watering hole, get shit- faced, and try and get laid.
Yesterday, you were going to change the world.
- Well, I thought better that.
- So you' re going to do nothing?
You' re the one that wanted to leave it alone.
So it' s people like you and me that help McGovern get away with murder.
You and your daddy are cut from the same cloth.
- Let' s leave my father out of it.
- No, I don' t think so.
It must have been tough growing up in the great man' s shadow.
But let me cut him down to size for you.
Howard Robinson covers the Islamic revolution... that topples the Shah of Iran.
He backs it up with eyewitness accounts of atrocities and mass murders.
Truth is, he spent most of his days in the Tehran Hilton, shagging me.
Bullshit.
His stories were ripped off from local Persian journalists... most of whom, I might add, did not survive the Ayatollah' s purges.
No witness, no one to expose him.
What, nothing to say?
Hank, look on the bright side.
He would' ve been so proud of you.
No, with all due respect, I think you' re wrong.
No, you should lead with this, then pick this up later.
- It is much stronger, believe me.
- Yes, okay.
Our report on Señor Pla.
- Fair and balanced, I hope.
- Just like you asked for.
Good lad.
You know, Nicola, I think our Hank is beginning to tire of Barcelona.
Perhaps we should find a more interesting spot for him.
Baghdad, say, or Kabul?
- I' m so sorry, Archie.
Really.
- I' m such a klutz!
- It' s all right.
- No problem.
- Sorry.
- Thank you very much.
- You' re welcome.
You two need a coffee break.
Now.
Just wanted to let you know that we' re going to do a story on you.
One I think you' il be rather pleased with.
Well, let me see.
"Computer genius..." and Internet pioneer. "
Wait.
"Legendary entrepreneur."
When we are finished, the whole world will want to get into bed with you.
The sky is the limit.
Robinson is a good dog.
He' il fetch and do as he' s told.
Besides, it would be rather unfortunate to have to... put down another journalist.
Nicola!
My turn to run into you.
Any special plans tonight?
Those are top secret.
- Is it Chanel you' re wearing?
- Archie!
- Who' s the lucky man?
- I' il never tell.
Do I know him?
You' il never get away with this, you know.
Dating fellow employees is against company regulations.
Okay, I' il quit.
- Look, let me give you a ride.
- No, thanks, Archie.
Bye.
- Goodbye.
I' m so sorry, Archie.
Nicola, you sneaky little devil.
Nicola!
- I had the story in my hands.
- All right.
I loved your father.
I' il nail them to a wall.
I swear to you.
What are you waiting for?
Impress me.
Brechner.
Listen, they killed her, okay?
They killed Nicola.
We end this now.
Robinson!
- Hank, what happened?
- Don' t ask.
- Listen, is the tape set?
- from the studio right now.
Brechner.
Make sure the rats don' t escape.
I' m calling the cops.
- Hello.
- Hey, how are you doing?
- Brechner.
- No, no, no.
Yeah, that' s it.
- He' s on his cell phone.
- Keep him talking.
If I can find his frequency, we can broadcast it from the studio.
- Listen, maybe we can cut a deal.
- I' m afraid not, pal.
You' re not working out as we had hoped.
Your resignation is required.
- I even convinced McGovern to recruit you.
- I' ve got his frequency.
I followed you for a week after the Nova incident.
You never showed any sign of remorse, not once.
I said, "This is our guy!"
I even cleaned up after you.
Remember Joaquim?
A few drops of hydrochloric acid in a glass of beer... problem solved, if you know what I mean.
- Nicola?
Straight to the aorta.
Melts away the protective cardiac tissue.
Looks just like a heart attack, don' t you think?
Very clean.
Hey, that' s my set.
You helped me.
They are all dead because of you.
You endangered their lives just so you could get one step closer.
To what, Hank?
The top?
So ugly, isn' t it, Hank?
I may have done the deed, but you sure made it easy.
- Listen to me, you son of a bitch!
- Now, now, now, Hank!
You should be thanking me.
You' re not dead.
I' ve allowed you to.
- Why don' t you go to hell?
- Maybe I will.
But after you, my friend.
And Hank, when you get there... say hi to Carlos Aribau.
Hello.
I don' t think so.
You know, this is the second time I' ve had to hold a gun to your head.
You remember.
I think I' ve let you live long enough.
God damn it!
This is so sweet.
Interpol.
Everything is all right.
What?
Good thing your friend Pedro called the police... when he saw your impromptu broadcast.
We' ve been tracking these two for months.
- following me to get to him.
- Well, I' m sorry.
- Yeah.
- Are you all right?
I' ve been better.
I' m sorry.
The tape will destroy Pla.
It' s finally over.
Not quite.
Did you have to make such a scene?
Nobody will suspect me.
He saw what we wanted him to see.
The evidence of the released videotape led to the immediate arrest of Manuel Pla.
The damning video was shot by... journalist Carlos Aribau and his cameraman.
I stole it.
I apologise to them... and to you.
As journalists, we have all taken a sacred oath... to report nothing but the truth.
But sometimes... in the mad race for glory and ratings... we forget our promise.
It' s then your duty to remind us... to keep us vigilant, to keep us honest... to keep us fair.
Because in the end... you get the press you deserve.
This is Hank Robinson for Vision TV... signing off.
What are you all staring at?
Get back to work!
What the hell do you think you' ve done?
By ruining me, you' ve only achieved your own destruction, son.
I' m not your son, I have a father, you piece of shit.
- Don' t -- - Temper, McGovern.
Not that it would make much difference.
- Take care, Mr. Robinson.
- Thank you.
Hey, Marisa.
What was it?
"Believe nothing of what you hear and only half of what you see."
Words to the wise.
That' s for you.
Thank you.
- Mr. Robinson.
- Yeah?
Can I get my old job back?
I' il think about it.
I thought you' d be taller.
So, Vincent...
- What are the two names?
- Ramone Ayala and Clarke.
Both killed?
- Clarke for sure.
Ramone, I don' t know.
Daniel Baker out of South Central, Leimert Park.
- Three what?
- Witnesses.
Vincent meets their people in Culiacan or Cartagena.
Now you' re here.
Why?
The list.
I want you to listen to me real well.
Special groups put together the list of "dedos."
- "Dedos." - Fingers. lnformants.
Signal interceptions with voice- recognition software, surveillance.
A very expensive counterintelligence worked up that list.
Wouldn' t you say?
And you lost it?
I' m sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry?
"Sorry" does not put Humpty Dumpty back together again.
- Do you believe in Humpty Dumpty?
- No.
- Do you believe in Santa Claus?
Nor do l.
Nor do I, but my children do.
They are still small.
But do you know who they like even better than Santa Claus?
Pedro el Negro.
Black Peter.
There' s an old Mexican tale that tells of how Santa Claus got so busy looking out for the good children, that he had to hire some help to look out for the bad children.
So he hired Pedro.
And Santa Claus gave him a list with all the names of all the bad children.
And Pedro would come every night to check them out.
And the people, the little kids that were misbehaving, that were not saying their prayers,
Pedro would leave a little toy donkey on their windows.
A little burro, and he would come back.
lf they were still misbehaving, Pedro would take them away and nobody would ever see them again.
Now, if I am being Santa Claus, and you are Pedro, how do you think jolly old Santa Claus would feel if one day Pedro came into his office and said, "I lost the list"?
How fucking furious do you think he will get?
Tell me, Vincent.
Tell me what you think.
- - What?
I think...
I think you should tell the guy... behind me...... to put that gun down.
What did you say?
I said you should tell the guy behind me to put his gun away before I take it and beat his bitch ass to death with it.
- Federal?
- I don' t know, you tell me.
That' s why I tossed the list.
The work- ups, all of that shit.
To protect, in part... your Hermes Façonnable ass.
You think I like coming in here?
But, hey...... shit happens.
Darwin.
The fat man, the penthouse guy, the jazz man.
That leaves two.
Can you finish?
ln six years...... when have I not? "Say it ‘ s Vincent."
- Vincent?
- That' s what I' m hearing. "I '" m Vincent. "
Your last two.
And by the way, as a token of my appreciation
For all my services, 25 percent.
Very generous.
Hell, make it 35.
And by the way...
Daniel said he was sorry.
To my cell phone.
No, no, I' il wait.
ls there anybody else in that cab?
Vegas odds would' ve been against you walking out of there.
Yeah, I' m very impressive.
You know it?
Locate our witness, Peter Lim.
Get him evacuated and safe.
African American, medium build.
The assault team will do the takedown.
I want air support to maintain at 1 500 feet.
Thank you.
- How long?
- 1 2 minutes.
According to the cab' s dispatch unit, he' s been driving that cab for 1 2 years.
So what?
You' re telling me the guy walks into a phone booth and changes into a meat- eater super assassin?
What' s he do, squeeze them in between fares?
The real driver is floating down a storm drain.
The guy who walked out looks like this.
- He picked a driver who looks like him.
- I don' t know.
I do.
Zee?
We see private- sector security companies hiring out to cartels in Colombia, Russia, Mexico, hiring ex- Special Forces, Stasi, ex- KGB, like that, all the time.
Guys with trigger time, skill sets, tradecraft, look like a cab driver.
What are you going to do?
Save our witness.
What if they' re wrong?
The guy' s admitting his name is Vincent.
He' s in there talking to the bad guys.
- There is something else going on.
- There' s nothing.
I thought there was, there isn' t.
It' s their ball, their game.
- Nothing for you.
It' s late, I' m going home.
You know what time it is?
They locate Peter Lim?
- The wife thinks he' s at Fever.
Move it.
Witness is at Fever, Sixth and Alexandria.
That' s where Vincent is going.
{y: i} Assault team "and remaining unit", "take Vincent."
{y: i} First unit on the scene {y: i} will get the witness out.
We copy that.
- You going to call her?
- Who?
The one who gave you her business card.
I don' t know.
Maybe, maybe not.
What?
Pick up the phone.
Life' s short.
One day it' s gone.
You and I make it out of this alive, you should call her.
That' s what I think.
There he is.
Hit it.
The table towards the back is where he hangs.
Wilke, take the right.
Move 1 5 feet ahead, three feet left.
Clear?
There' s Lim.
Second booth from the left.
Get him out.
Middle of the dance floor.
FBl!
FBl!
Get your hands in the air!
Get your hands in the air, Vincent!
Yo, put the gun down!
You got the wrong...
Pedrosa' s been shot.
Get an RA unit.
Hold on.
I' m Max!
I' m a goddamn cab driver, man!
I' m a goddamn cab driver.
I' m getting you out of here.
I' m LAPD.
Come on.
- You' re okay.
Just move it.
You' re OK, you' re OK.
- - Let' s go!
Drive!
Only thing didn' t show up was the Polish cavalry.
You' re alive.
I saved you.
Do I get any thanks?
All you can do is clam up.
Tell me to fuck off?
Fuck off.
You had to kill Fanning?
- Who the fuck is Fanning?
Why' d you have to kill him?
Kids will grow up without him.
He believed me.
I should' ve saved him because he believed you.
- Not that.
- Yeah.
What' s wrong with that?
- It' s what I do for a living.
- Head downtown.
- What' s downtown?
How are you at math?
I did four.
Why didn' t you just kill me and get another cab driver?
You' re good.
We' re in this together.
Cosmic coincidence.
- You full of shit.
- I' m full of shit?
You even bullshitted yourself, if all I am is taking out garbage, killing bad people.
- That' s what you said.
- You believe me?
- Then what' d they do?
- How do I know?
They all got that "witness for the prosecution" look to me.
Probably some major federal indictment of somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted.
So that' s the reason?
That' s the "why." There' s no reason.
There' s no good or bad reason to live or to die.
Then what are you?
lndifferent.
Millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink.
Lost in space.
The cop, you, me...
Who notices?
What' s with you?
As in?
"You got to tell me what' s going on with this person over here or I' il kill you.
What is driving him?
What was he thinking? "
You know, you couldn' t do it, could you, because...... they' d have to kill your ass because you don' t know what anyone else is thinking.
I think you' re low, my brother.
Way low.
One of those institutionalized raised guys?
Anybody home?
The standard parts that are supposed to be there in people, in you...... aren' t.
And why haven' t you killed me yet?
Sigmund Freud meets Dr. Ruth.
Answer the question.
Look in the mirror.
Paper towels, clean cab, limo company someday.
- How much you got saved?
Someday?
Someday my dream will come?
One night you' il wake up and you' il discover it never happened.
Suddenly you are old.
And it never will because you were never going to do it anyway.
You' il push it into memory, then zone out in your Barcalounger, being hypnotized by daytime TV for the rest of your life.
Don' t you talk to me about murder.
All it ever took was a down payment on a Lincoln Town Car.
You can' t even call that girl.
What the fuck are you still doing driving a cab?
Because I never straightened up and looked at it, you know?
Myself.
I should have.
I tried to gamble my way out from under, but that was just a born- to- lose deal.
It' s got to be perfect to go.
Risk all torqued down.
I could' ve done it anytime I wanted to.
Red light.
But you know what?
It doesn' t matter anyway.
What does it matter anyway?
We' re all insignificant out here in this big- ass nowhere.
Twilight Zone shit.
Says the badass sociopath in my back seat.
Because until now, I never looked at it that way.
Fix it.
What do we got to lose anyway, right?
Why?
You going to pull the trigger and kill us?
- Slow the hell down.
You going to shoot me now?
You going to kill us?
Well, shoot my ass then.
- You' re right.
You know what, Vincent?
Go fuck yourself!
Well, that was brilliant.
Didn' t have your seat belt on?
1 L- 20, show me code six at Olympic and Figueroa on a TC with injuries.
Are you okay?
What happened?
Sir, you were involved in an accident.
An ambulance is on its way to help you.
You understand what I' m saying?
Sit down and relax, okay?
Don' t worry about the cab.
They' il get you a new one.
Relax and breathe.
Put your hands up!
Put your hands up.
Get down on your knees!
- Arrest me.
Take me to jail.
Don' t move!
1 L- 20, I need a backup on a 1 87 suspect.
Put the gun down!
- Put your hands down!
Stop moving!
Cuff your hands together.
Hold your hands together.
Listen, somebody' s going to get killed if I don' t go right now.
Call the cops.
Whoa!
Pick up. -
Pick up.
- U. S. Attorney' s Office.
"Max", "the cab driver."
"Listen to me", "all right?" {y: i} A guy named Vincent...
"Listen to me", "Annie."
It' s kind of a strange time to be calling.
There' s a man named Vincent.
He' s coming to kill you.
- He' s what?
He' s coming to kill you!
{y: i} He was scoping out the building "when" I "dropped you off..."
lf this is supposed to be some type of joke, it' s not funny.
It' s not a joke.
Listen to me, please.
Felix hired him.
Felix Reyes- Torrena.
How do you know about my case?
I don' t understand.
He' s coming to kill you.
"When" I "dropped you off", I "don ‘ t know how", but he ended up in my cab.
"Annie", "listen." "All" I "want you to do..."
- I "don ‘ t understand." - Listen.
Please listen.
Get out of the building.
- "I '" m leaving the building now. "- No, wait.
- "Wait", "wait."
I' m on the 1 6th floor.
I' m in the Law Library and Files.
He' s two floors below you, corner office.
ln my office?
"He does not know you ‘ re there." {y: i} Stay there and call 9 1 1.
Are you sure he' s on the 1 4th floor?
Just stay there and just call the police.
Max.
- Max.
- He knows you' re up there.
Annie.
Annie.
Operator.
There is a man in my building and he is...
Let her go.
Max?
What are you going to do about it? - -
Max!
Felix Reyes- Torrena?
Yeah.
How?
He said his name is Vincent.
Max!
I do this for a living!
We' re almost...... at the next stop.
Hey, Max...
A guy gets on the MTA here in L. A. and dies.
Think anybody will notice?
It all started on the day that I died.
If there had been an obituary...... it would' ve described the unremarkable life...... of an unremarkable woman...... survived by no one.
But there was no obituary...... because the day that I died...... was also the day I started to live.
But that comes later.
This was my life.
Days blended together, consistently ordinary...... thanks to a job that was the practical version of my passion.
- I' m sorry.
- Watch where you’ re going!
I was supposed to be an artist by now.
Instead...... I was designing ads for beauty cream.
- You are so addicted to that stuff, Sally.
- Happily.
- Beau- line is magic in a bottle.
- I don' t know how you get it.
- It' s not even in production yet.
- We have our ways.
- Hey.
- No!
Headaches again.
My brain' s all tight and cranky.
In one week, precisely, we will launch the most exciting...... and revolutionary product to hit the beauty industry since...... soap.
Beau- line.
Now, Beau- line doesn' t just hide the effects of aging...... it actually reverses them.
However, with change...... must come sacrifice.
My husband...... and I have decided that it' s time for me to step aside...... as the face of Hedare.
It has been a magnificent 15 years.
But we have decided to choose a new face to represent Beau- line.
Exactly.
Drina.
The future of Hedare Beauty.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, I look forward...... to seeing you at the gala, where you can toast to Drina and our success.
Careful, George.
She' s not old enough to drink.
You' ve got more talent than anybody in the building, which I hate you for.
Sal, this is my first lead campaign.
You know that.
What is wrong with you?!
Good luck.
Yeah.
You simply couldn' t resist it, could you?
You had to make a scene out of it, Laurel.
What' s the matter, George?
Did I steal your moment?
Come in!
Hi, Mr. Hedare.
Did you still want to see me, or...?
- Sit.
Okay.
I' m not pleased.
This isn' t even close to what I wanted.
I can' t imagine what on earth you were thinking.
I am so sorry -
I mean, look at this red.
I wanted it darker.
- I specifically heard you say - - I know what I said.
Maybe I misunderstood you.
- Clearly.
Mr. Hedare, I know I can fix it.
If you give me a chance, I know I can fix it.
I do not reward incompetence.
I have no idea why I expected your art to show better taste than your wardrobe.
Oh, and do try and get a manicure, will you?
Oh, for God' s sake, George.
Let her fix it.
She' s good and you know it.
Whatever.
By tomorrow night.
Midnight.
Right.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Hi!
Do you think you could just maybe turn the music down...... just a little bit?
No?
Okay.
Kitty.
How' d you get up there?
Come down here.
What, are you stuck?
You' re gonna make me come out there.
Hold on a minute!
Whatever you' re thinking or feeling...... it' s not worth it, you understand?
Maybe I can help.
I' m fine.
- It' s just that - - Listen to me.
We' il get through this together.
What' s your name?
Patience Phillips.
But this cat...
Sure, sure, Patience, and it' s a real beauty.
- Very cute.
- The cat' s not up here anymore.
And I' m sure that makes you very sad.
- Twenty- three!
Hold on!
Hurry.
I got you.
- You okay?
- Thanks.
You sure you' re okay?
That was the cat.
You actually climbed out there to rescue your cat?
Yeah.
It' s not my cat, it' s a cat.
To rescue somebody else' s cat?
Well, that' s something else.
Oh, my gosh, I' m late for my job!
- I' m on a deadline today.
- Yeah?
Well, good luck with that.
Thanks.
Thank you!
After all, no one can defeat Father Time.
Though you did put up a hell of a fight, didn' t you?
Beau- line works wonders, doesn' t it?
Yes, it does.
I have a busy day today.
Drinks, then dinner.
Don' t wait up, will you, darling?
I stopped waiting a long time ago, George.
Oh, and that lunch tomorrow?
- Cancel that too, will you?
- Problems?
I doubt it...... but Slavicky won' t stop calling.
They' re worse than models.
You have to coddle them all the time like little children.
I' il have Wesley reschedule.
Bye.
Hey!
Man sandwich, 12 o' clock.
Oh, my God.
Hello, Miss Phillips.
Hi.
This is the officer I was telling you about from earlier.
Detective Lone.
- Tom Lone.
- God, that is such a good name.
Tom Lone.
Rhymes with cone, phone, bone.
Not that rhyming' s all that important.
Alone.
- Hi.
How' d you get...?
You dropped something.
You can really cover a lot of ground when you' re in a hurry.
Thanks.
Is this yours?
Yeah.
- It' s nice.
- Thanks.
Yeah, it kind of reminds me of early Chagall.
Elegant, but whimsical.
Very much in the...... tradition of the old Dutch Masters.
Don' t be.
I noticed all the art in your apartment, so I Googled it at the office.
- No, but really, I like it.
- Thanks.
Listen, I wanted to apologize about this morning for thinking you were a jumper.
I was hoping to make it up by taking you to coffee.
I know this great Italian place around the corner, Grecchio' s on 6th.
Or, listen, maybe tomorrow' s better.
Say, 1: 00?
Yes.
- Okay.
- Yeah?
Okay.
So tomorrow then, 1: 00.
- You make sure she gets there.
- Yes, officer.
- Counting on you.
- I screw it up...... you can throw away the key.
See you tomorrow.
Okay, bye.
- That is a man in serious like with you.
- You think?
- Hello.
- We got a lot of work to do.
First, you gotta shave those legs.
Second, wear that leather outfit we got you for your birthday.
- Remember?
- First, it' s only coffee.
And second, I will never, ever, ever wear that leather outfit.
Good night!
Hi, this is Patience in the art department.
Yeah, I' m expecting a messenger to come and pick up -
But it' s gotta be there by midnight.
I know it' s not your fault, but...
Okay.
I' il take it myself.
Is anybody in there?
Oh, come on, Slavicky.
When did you grow a conscience?
I don' t care that the FDA never saw the headaches...... and the nausea and the fainting spells.
Those are symptoms I can live with.
And with what we stand to make from consumers demanding their fix...... I can live with it being addictive.
But these side effects from the long- term studies...
That won' t happen if they keep using it.
And we' il make sure they do...... because that' s where the money comes from.
I' m not sure anymore.
I thought I could live with it...... but I can' t live with turning people into monsters.
Oh, my gosh!
You' ve gotta let me pull the plug.
We can' t let this go on the shelves.
Who' s there?
- Armando, come in.
- I' m on my way.
You can come out now.
It' s okay.
We' d just like to ask you a few questions.
Sorry.
But I think maybe I' m in the wrong -
- What are you doing?
- Don' t ever do that again.
Where is she?
She ran down to waste treatment, jumped in a pipe.
We don' t know who she is, but we know what she heard.
We can' t risk it.
Get rid of her.
Seal the door.
Patience Phillips, I' ve never been so proud of you.
You 're probably sipping your decaf soy whatever...... fantasizing about licking the foam off his lips.
Wait, that' s what I' m doing.
How' d the presentation go?
Did you get me free samples of it?
Listen, call me.
What...?
Hi, I' il take a decaf latte.
Hey, Patience, it' s Tom Lone.
I' m here at Grecchio' s waiting...... and you 're not here.
Anyway, I gotta get back to work, so...
Bye.
Okay, kitty.
It' s time for you to go home.
Now...
- Are you Ophelia Powers?
- Yes.
- I got your cat off a ledge and ever since - - Why, Midnight.
You' ve never brought a stranger home before.
Please, come in.
No, I can' t come in.
I' ve got to go to - I' m late.
- Midnight.
- I' m sorry?
Her name.
She' s an Egyptian Mau, the rarest of breeds.
Temple cats.
It' s said that Maus have special powers.
Like popping out of nowhere?
I know.
Among other things.
Your cat...
Socrates!
No caffeine.
It makes him irritable.
You look a little out of sorts yourself, my dear.
The cats, perhaps.
They seem to be taking quite an unusual shine to you.
This has been a really bad day for me already.
- I can' t even remember most of yesterday.
- Perhaps I can help you.
Right.
This really isn' t your problem.
I don' t even know why I' m here.
- Really.
I' m late for work.
I shouldn' t even...
I' m always here.
Catnip.
No -
I am fine.
What the hell is wrong with you?!
You never delivered the design!
You don' t even know where they are.
You do not know where they are because, and I quote you, you "cannot remember"!
Your incompetence is staggering!
Are you even listening to me?
I' m sorry!
"Sorry"?
Sorry' s not nearly enough.
Okay.
Then let me try the remix.
I' m sorry for every second I wasted...... working for an untalented, unethical egomaniac like you.
Clean out your cubicle.
You are fired.
Mr. Hedare!
I didn' t mean it.
Did I?
My hero.
Where did that come from?
I don' t know, it' s like I can' t describe it.
I was saying it, but I wasn' t saying it.
Do you understand?
Whoever said it has the thanks of a grateful art department.
You don' t understand, Sal.
I wanted to cause him pain.
I' m sorry.
- What was that?
- Allergies?
Maybe?
You just got fired, remember?
But it' s so pretty.
Hey.
Ever noticed when they keep you for observation no one really observes you?
- Did they tell you what was wrong?
- Oh, they have no idea.
They did run a million fun tests, though.
Hey, upside, you gotta see my doctor.
I can see you' re feeling better.
Reminds me, what' s up with the "hot yet modest, but who cares...... because he' s so hot" detective?
It' s not gonna work out, Sal.
Patience, you never think it' s gonna work.
Trust me.
Look, this time I refuse to let you sabotage a good thing.
If it' s broke, fix it.
All right?
Now, I love you, and he is gonna love you.
Now, go.
Go give him some brown sugar.
I gotta meet my hottie doctor.
Tell me I look vulnerable.
Being good is something you keep in your heart because you put it there.
I' m not saying it' s easy.
I' m not saying some people don' t choose to be bad.
I want something better.
- You understand?
- Yeah.
- Can I see your gun?
- No.
- You know what makes somebody - - Will you shoot it?
No.
I want you to be the good guys, got it?
- Yeah.
- Let' s go shoot some hoops.
I called the police station and they said you might be here.
You never got your coffee.
Well, you' re a brave man to be facing a mob like this.
No backup?
I' m used to working alone, most of the time.
- Is that by choice, or - - Yeah, theirs.
No, I' ve had partners before.
Turns out I take my job too seriously.
That' s what she says about me.
She says that I' m fun- deficient.
- I don' t believe that.
- That' s what she says.
One- on- one?
- Who?
Me and her?
- Yeah, come on.
You wanna do this?
One- on- one One- on- one
I haven' t done that since I was a kid.
Come on.
Can we have our ball back?
You don' t seem so fun- deficient to me.
Mr. Hedare wanted me to inform you he' il be at the factory the rest of the day.
If by "factory" you mean the Four Seasons...... teaching Drina to unlock the minibar...... consider me informed.
- He' il be working with -
Wesley, George hasn' t said anything meaningful to me since he said "I do."
- Hello?
- You' d think with the advances...... in medicine, this place would have a wet bar.
- Seems like you' re feeling better.
- Some new medication I can' t pronounce.
- So, what' s up?
Just fixing a little snack.
What I' d like to know is did you fix it with the cute cop?
I think I did.
Details!
And make it good, honey.
I' m sitting here in a paper dress, for God' s sakes.
All we did was talk.
And play a little one- on- one.
- You know how to play basketball?
- Apparently I do.
- I even went Shaquille on his butt.
- Patience, have I taught you nothing?
You never beat a guy at sports.
It messes them up.
They end up in a men' s group, banging on a drum.
It' s not like I meant to.
It just happened.
I' m telling you, Sal, something really, really weird is happening to me.
- I practically jumped him.
- That' s called lust, sweetheart.
- Animal attraction.
- You think?
What if it gets worse?
- I mean, what if the next time - - Next time?
He asked you out again?
- I love this guy.
- So do I. But it' s me I' m worried about.
- I felt like I couldn' t be myself.
- Well, feel free to be me next time.
- Sally - - I' m teasing.
Just be yourself.
Myself.
Okay.
- I' il try.
- Oh, I gotta go.
Future father of my children' s coming.
Sweet dreams, honey.
Excuse me.
I think I might have a fever.
Hey!
- Shut that off!
- Get a life!
Yeah, get a life, you loser!
Sorry, babe.
This ain' t the slumber party.
However...... in your case, I can make an exception.
I' m flattered.
But do you think this one time...... you could turn the music down just a little...... bit.
Tell you what, why don' t I do it myself?
Listen, you freak -
I' m sorry, what did you say?
Is the music still too loud?
Hey!
You hear that?
It' s called silence.
That' s all I ever wanted.
Now, keep it down.
Thanks for the party.
I had fun.
- Time to accessorize.
- My bike!
Amateurs.
You boys thought you could come in here and steal all these beautiful things?
What a perfect idea.
Meow.
That was one of a kind.
- From Egypt.
- That' s a hell of a profile.
Thieves said she jumps around like a cat.
What should we call her?
"Cat Chick"?
No, no. "Cat Broad."
What do you got?
Cupcakes.
Midnight.
I knew you' d come back when you were ready.
The goddess Bast.
The Maus are sacred to Bast.
They' re her messengers.
- You wrote this?
- I was a professor for 20 years...... until I was denied tenure.
Male academia.
Bast is a rarity.
A goddess of the moon, and of the sun.
She represents the duality in all women.
Docile, yet aggressive.
Nurturing, yet ferocious.
I mean -
What happened the other night?
- I don' t remember.
- Do you want me to tell you?
Yes.
You died.
What?
I didn' t die.
Look at me, I' m right here.
You died.
- But you were reborn.
- Oh, you' re crazy.
- You are a crazy cat lady.
- Midnight knew your fate.
That' s why she tested you.
To see if you were worthy of a gift she could give you.
A gift that could change your life...... and give you a new one.
You' re not alone, child.
He' s saved others before you.
Look.
Catwomen are not contained by the rules of society.
You follow your own desires.
This is both a blessing and a curse.
You will often be alone and misunderstood.
But you will experience a freedom other women will never know.
You are a catwoman.
Every sight, every smell...... every sound, incredibly heightened.
Fierce independence, total confidence, inhuman reflexes.
- So I' m not Patience anymore?
- You are Patience.
And you are Catwoman.
Accept it, child.
You' ve spent a lifetime caged.
By accepting who you are, all of who you are...... you can be free.
And freedom is power.
You saved my life, Midnight.
But somebody killed me...... and I' ve got to find out who, and why.
You dealt with Slavicky?
It' s done.
Oh, my God.
We danced all night.
- Been here all night.
- Absolutely.
Keep the change.
- What can I do for you?
- White Russian.
No ice, hold the vodka, hold the Kahlua.
Straight up.
Looking for something?
She was a nice girl.
Why?
Cat got your tongue?
They told me to flush the pipes so I flushed the pipes.
- Why?
- I don' t know why.
Beau- line.
There' s something wrong with Beau- line.
She heard something she wasn' t supposed to hear.
And Hedare is covering it up.
I can' t live with turning people into monsters.
Hey, hey, hey.
You look amazing.
- Do you like it?
- Love it.
- Like the hair?
- Love the hair.
- Did good?
- You did real good.
This guy is good for you.
Aren' t you glad I pushed you into it?
Let me hear my props.
- Props to Sally.
- Yeah.
Clothes, and a treat.
So are you gonna be okay, or what?
I do feel better.
That' s maybe laying off the Cosmos for a couple days.
Check this out.
Some chick in a cat suit murdered Slavicky last night.
The actions of this lunatic will not keep Beau- line off the shelves.
We will launch next week as planned...... because we owe it to the women of this country.
- Because - - Please.
That guy is so full of himself.
- I' m almost out.
- Let' s see.
How long have you been having headaches?
- About a month.
- Do me a favor.
- Stop using this.
- Why?
Because it' s making you sick.
Trust me.
Thank you, lieutenant.
You' re gonna roll with him.
For Tom, from forensics.
Oh, and Slavicky homicide.
Maybe you' il want to look at that.
Hey, Bob, let me ask you a question.
Would your wife crawl out on the ledge of a building to rescue a cat?
Maybe, if the cat was carrying a pizza.
Well, there are similarities.
- Shape of the S, harsh stroke of the R' s.
- Were they written by the same person?
Well, it' s not an exact science.
Indicative of loneliness.
And the O reaching out, insecure.
Handwriting of a people- pleaser.
Now, we look at the loop of the Y.
Very self- confident, almost angry.
And the O, well, this person doesn' t like to play by the rules.
- So they' re different people.
- Very.
If you put these two women in the same room...... you' re gonna have one hell of a party.
- You got a big weekend planned, Tom?
- I do now.
Aren' t you supposed to let me win?
Not that kind of girl.
- What kind of girl is that?
- A loser.
Hey, can I ask you a question?
You work for Hedare, right?
Somebody was murdered at his factory the other night.
I' m sorry.
Can you think of anybody who might have a grudge against the company?
Lots of people.
George Hedare isn' t the nicest guy in the world, you know.
He fired me.
What?
Am I a suspect now, detective?
No.
Looks like we' il be up here for a while.
You in a hurry?
Mom!
- Hey!
- Don' t move!
Hold on tight.
I gotta stop this thing.
- Mom!
- Frankie.
Help, Mom!
Help!
You are one tough little guy, you know that?
- Take it easy, partner.
- Bye.
It' s over.
Well, I' m not sure how you did it, but I' m impressed.
Well, I saw how you did.
And so am I.
- You know what?
- What?
We should celebrate.
Why don' t you let me take you to dinner tonight?
I would love to, but I can' t.
Not tonight.
I' ve got...... some business that I have to take care of.
You picked the wrong house.
You' re the cat that killed Slavicky.
You don' t believe everything you see on TV, do you?
- What do you want?
- Your husband.
Is he home?
I' m here.
Why on earth would he be home?
Oh, too bad.
If your husband ever comes home, tell him I know all about Beau- line.
It' s disease in a jar.
I wouldn' t caulk a sink with it.
I' ve been using it for years.
- It' s your funeral.
Because whoever killed Slavicky did it to keep Beau- line' s toxic little secret.
Are you suggesting that my husband is a murderer?
I' m suggesting that you tell me where he is.
- So I' il ask him myself.
- I suppose I should be shocked.
Protest his innocence.
But the truth is...... that man' s capable of anything.
You wanna find him?
There he is.
- Thanks.
- I' d like to help.
How can I reach you?
I' m not exactly listed.
Take my phone.
Call the cops.
You' re not going to believe this.
I think this is a total waste of time.
- Don' t.
- What?
Ever.
Consider it a condition of our relationship.
I love this part.
- Who the hell -?
- Like my nails?
Just got them done.
My bad.
Get your paws off me this instant!
I know about Beau- line, and your cover- up.
What?
So did my girl, Patience.
That' s why you killed her.
- What?
I didn' t kill her - - Too bad your last words will be a lie.
Freeze!
Hey!
Hold it right there.
Don' t you move.
Now, come down from there nice and easy.
Cats come when they feel like it.
Not when they' re told.
Hands on your head.
You' re under arrest.
Gotcha!
- You think this is a game?
- Now we' re playing.
- You' re playing.
I' m at work.
- Seems like you love your job.
- Don' t I get din- din first?
- I' il feed you in your cell.
Careful.
That cable hits us, we' re both fried.
I knew I felt a spark between us.
- Not on the first date.
- Don' t flatter yourself.
I' m taken.
Does she know about us?
There' s no "us."
Too bad.
It' s over.
There she is.
Okay, boys.
Who can see in the dark?
I can.
But this is a disaster!
It' s a total bloody disaster.
Who is she, anyway?
And how come -?
It' s all right.
Don' t be scared.
You haven' t got a clue, do you?
"Don' t be scared"?
No.
My advice to you, George...... quit the self- tanning.
Stop eating Viagra like they' re vitamins.
Resist the urge to date children born the same day they invented the cell phone.
For once, George, in your miserable life...... be a man!
Terrific.
Beau- line works wonders, doesn' t it?
Okay, Sal.
What do you think?
I don' t know.
You going to a church or a Playboy mansion?
Well, that was helpful.
I' m such a freak.
Please, I' m a freak Thursday through Sunday, big deal.
Okay, but what if he doesn' t like...... the real me?
- He can' t pick and choose, Patience.
If he wants this to work, he' s gonna have to like all of you.
- Senora Hedare.
Perdon.
- Go.
Pretty.
- Thanks.
- Oh, you too.
But I was talking about the fish.
Detective work is like dating.
It' s all about the pursuit.
But when you catch them -
You like your sushi, huh?
That' s good.
So tell me about this one...... that got away.
Catwoman.
- You heard of her?
Hot, black leather, whip.
She kissed me.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- What do you think about that?
- Depends.
- You like bad girls?
- Only if they like me back.
No, listen, bad isn' t something that does it for me.
Gotta be something in between, right?
Maybe it' s a little more complicated.
- Why don' t we talk about you?
- Okay.
- What' s it like to be an artist?
- Well, I' m not really an artist.
I mean, yeah, I did go to art school...... but then I got a regular job at an advertising agency...... and now I don' t really know what I am anymore.
Well, I know what you are.
You' re different.
You' re special.
- And I like that about you.
- Thanks.
No, it' s true.
And I want to know more about you.
You know...... I guess there' s a few things I need to explain.
Huh?
- Your dunk shot?
- No, that' s not what I was thinking.
Hey.
You can tell me anything.
I' m...
I hate the rain!
What were you saying?
Nothing important.
It' s me.
You were right about Beau- line' s secrets.
I can' t believe it, but you were right.
Beau- line is toxic.
I have proof.
We can stop him, but we have to stop him together.
George will be launching Beau- line at a press conference tomorrow.
Beau- line will be on the shelves on Monday.
So, what' d you find?
Enough evidence to put someone away for a long, long time.
I was everything they wanted me to be.
I was never more beautiful.
Never more powerful.
And then I turned 40 and they threw me away.
It' s all there behind the desk.
How' d I do?
The clawed- flesh thing was a little tricky...... but I think I pulled it off.
- You killed him?
- No one is gonna stop Beau- line...... from hitting the shelves.
Not Slavicky.
Not George.
And certainly not you.
I' m sorry.
I' m forgetting my manners.
Can I offer you something?
Saucer of milk?
Which, sweetheart, you just emptied into my husband' s chest.
Oh, George!
Help, somebody help!
She killed George.
Oh, my God!
I' m sorry.
I guess you could take this right out of my hands if you wanted.
If I wanted.
I' m telling you, Slavicky had evidence that Beau- line was toxic.
That' s why Laurel killed him.
George found out and she killed him too.
She was covering it up.
The gun in your hand.
- Catwoman' s hand.
- What' s the difference?
- Guess it doesn' t matter.
- Don' t you understand?
All of the evidence, every single piece, it points to you.
There' s nothing that shows me anything else.
There' s me.
You can believe me.
Do you remember the first time you saw me?
Yeah.
What did you see?
A girl...... rescuing a cat.
No, you didn' t.
You saw a crazy person out on a ledge trying to jump.
And all the evidence pointed to that, didn' t it?
I really need you to believe me.
How can I?
I don' t know who you are.
I' m the same girl you were with last night.
Take her back.
You be a nice kitty, now.
Look at it this way, Lone.
You may have lost your woman, but at least you got your man.
Did I?
Yeah.
Hello, Midnight.
You' ve spent a lifetime caged.
By accepting who you are, all of who you are...... you can be free.
And freedom is power.
It' s not just about me anymore, Midnight.
You know...... Lassie would have brought me a key.
Cross your paws.
- We 're gonna shift- change in half an hour.
- All right.
- Dave' s gonna take over then?
- Yeah, as far as I know.
Yeah, right through here, pal.
You' il get to talk to a lawyer.
Are you okay?
A girl like me lands on her feet.
Wait!
My husband dreamed of a world...... where every woman could be as beautiful as she wanted to be.
He dedicated his life pursuing that dream.
As Hedare' s new chief executive...... I intend to make that dream a reality...... by proceeding with tomorrow' s launch of Beau- line.
Thank you!
Thank you so much.
I have been dying to get some of this stuff.
My husband would have wanted you to have it.
He wanted that for everyone.
- Detective Lone.
What a surprise.
- Yeah?
Everyone, this is the man that brought my husband' s killer to justice.
Can I talk to you, in private?
Come upstairs to my office.
- Number five, ready to go.
- Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, go ahead.
Right there.
Get a move on.
Gotta meet that midnight delivery.
There were claw marks all over his body.
- But not on Slavicky' s.
- Because she didn' t have the time.
She also didn' t have a motive.
- I don' t know.
- What if I told you I know the truth?
That I know who killed your husband, I know about Beau- line.
Why, detective, you make it sound like I' m a suspect.
What if I told you I had evidence?
If you have evidence, then how come I' m not in cuffs?
Well, you' re a smart woman, Mrs. Hedare.
Rich.
I thought maybe we could work something out.
So this evidence...
Pin it on the other girl?
If that' s what you want me to do.
And you?
- What do you want?
- You just gave me what I want.
You just told me it was you.
Now, why would you believe it was me?
Because I finally trusted a friend.
Yeah, well, your friend just got you killed.
Don' t be stupid, Laurel.
You don' t want to kill a cop.
I' m a woman, Lone.
I' m used to doing all kinds of things I don' t wanna do.
Give my regards to my husband.
How sweet.
Thanks.
Now I can kill you both.
Hold on, I gotta stop.
How is it?
Well, there goes my jump shot.
Listen.
I want you to know I' m sorry.
I should have trusted you all along.
You' re confusing me with somebody else.
Come on, Patience.
I' il take this side.
I can' t believe I ever trusted you.
- You' re a fake.
- And what are you?
A hero?
A freak?
If you don' t have an identity, why keep it a secret?
Because you killed me.
It was me you flushed down the pipes.
I' m Patience Phillips.
That' s who' s under there?
- I can' t be hurt.
- Beau- line.
You stop using it and your face disintegrates.
And if you keep using it, skin like living marble.
And you can' t feel a thing.
You' re just a scared little girl playing dress- up.
Nothing.
Where do you think you' re going?
You' re gonna look like a cop- killer.
You wanted to save him.
Honey, you couldn' t save yourself.
Game over.
Guess what.
It' s overtime.
Give me your hand!
Help me!
I might not be a hero, but I' m certainly not a killer.
You know...... once Laurel' s boys start talking...... we' il be able to wrap up these murder cases pretty easy.
And if Patience is back in her cell by tomorrow morning...... it' il be awfully tough to prove that she was Catwoman.
Exactly.
Delicious, thank you.
You know, the strawberry was good too.
The day I died was the day I started to live.
In my old life, I longed for someone to see what was special in me.
You did, and for that you' il always be in my heart.
But what I really needed was for me to see it.
And now I do.
You 're a good man, Tom.
But you live in a world that has no place for someone like me.
Oh, I' m very good.
But sometimes I' m bad.
But only as bad as I wanna be.
Freedom is power.
To live a life untamed and unafraid is the gift that I' ve been given...... and so my journey begins.
We were now a mobile Empire, stretching back thousands of miles to Greece...... cooks and architects, doctors and surveyors, moneylenders and wives, children, lovers, whores, and forget not the slaves...... that anonymous, bent, working spine of this new beast.
Ravaged or expanded, for better or worse...... no occupied territory remained the same again.
Although devoted to Roxane, Alexander' s visits to her tent diminished... as a year, then two, went by without a successor...... wounding Alexander' s great pride.
The surveyors are saying that Zeus chained Prometheus up there...... in one of those caves.
They say there' s a giant eagle' s nest just above it.
I suppose he drops down each night to peck out poor Prometheus' liver.
You remember what Aristotle told us of these mountains?
Yes, I do.
When we reached these heights, we' d look back and see Macedonia to the West...... and the Outer Ocean to the East...
... but I fear this world is far larger than anyone dreamed.
A world of Titans.
The scouts have been up every known trail, Alexander.
There is no way across...... except to the south...... into India.
Were we gods, we' d breach these walls to the Eastern Ocean.
We will, Alexander.
In a few years' time, we will return.
But first the men must see their homes.
Have you found your home, Ptolemy?
More and more, I think it will be Alexandria.
Well, at least it' s hot!
Thais, she loved it there.
Women bring men home.
I have no such feeling.
You have Babylon, Alexander...... where your mother awaits your invitation.
Yes, I have Babylon.
I strip away another illusion.
I sense Death will be the last...... yet still I push harder and harder to reach this... home.
Where has our eagle gone?
We must go on, Ptolemy...... until we find an End.
India, the land where the sun was born...... fabled to be even richer than Persia...... had never been explored or conquered.
From the beginning, he struggled to unify a land without a center.
Kings who conspired against one another...... a labyrinth of tribes, urged on by zealots and philosophers...... to die by the thousands for their strange gods.
Crateros, in the advance party, fought against men with hairy skins...... who were tiny and lived in the tops of trees.
Until Hephaistion convinced us these were animals who imitated men...... but wore their own skin.
They called this tribe "monkey".
It' s a monkey.
- Very intelligent.
Hello, little man.
Do they speak?
No, but they do sing and make noises.
And then there was the rain.
Never before had we seen water that fell from the gods...... for sixty days and nights.
What' s your son going to say?
Come on, man, the older you get, the stronger!
Give me my horse, Alexander.
Look out!
Pauvanus!
It' s to the neck.
Zeus, no!
Hold on, Dimnus.
Be brave!
Be brave.
Our quest for gold and glory evaporated as we realized there was none to be had.
Tempers worsened.
We massacred all Indians who resisted...... and with the local water putrid, we drank the strong wine.
Alexander often returned the lands we conquered to their defeated kings...... so as to make of them allies.
But this did not sit well with the Army, who began to wonder...... if Alexander was on some crazed quest to imitate the glory of Herakles.
Bagoas!
And to my mother' s god, Dionysus...... who we' re told by our Indian allies, traveled here before Herakles, some six thousand years ago!
To a hero!
Roxane!
You lose face!
These Indians, they are a low, evil people!
You don' t try to understand them.
I try.
But this I know, Alexander...... in Persia you are great King.
Let us go back to Babylon.
There you are strong.
We' il talk about this later.
Yes, later.
I shall come, tonight.
And I shall wait.
Good night, my King.
Your Majesty...
To Bagoas!
And the 30, 000 beautiful Persian boys...... we' re training to fight in this great Army!
And to the memory of Philip!
Had he lived to see his Macedonians transformed into such...... a pretty Army!
To Philip!
To a real hero!
Cleitus!
That' s a fancy way of putting it, Ptolemy...... but we all know what a pension and an exile is after thirty years' service!
You call governing this major province "exile"?
Has Your Majesty given any of his closest companions...... a province so far from home?
Then you won' t make a very good satrap, will you, Cleitus?
So be it!
Let me rot in Macedonian rags...... rather than shine in Eastern pomp!
I won' t quake and bow down like the sycophants you have around you.
Nearchus, Perdiccas!
As Governor of one of our most Asian of satrapies, Cleitus...... does it not occur to you, that if my Persian subjects bow down before me...... it' s important for them to do so?
Do I insist on Greeks doing the same?
You accept Greek offerings as a son of Zeus, do you not?
Only when offered.
Then why don' t you refuse these vain flatteries?
What freedom is this, to bow before you?
You bow before Herakles, do you not?
And he was mortal...... but a son of Zeus.
How can you, so young, compare yourself to Herakles?
Why not?
I' ve achieved more in my years...... traveled as far, probably farther.
Did you conquer Asia by yourself, Alexander?
Was it not your father?
Or is his blood no longer good enough?
Zeus- Amon, is it?
You insult me, Cleitus!
Be careful!
Never would your father have taken barbarians as his friends...... or asked us to fight with them as equals in war!
I remember a time when we could talk as men, straight to the eye.
None of this scraping and groveling!
And now you kiss them...... take a barbarian childless wife, and dare call her Queen!
Go quickly, Cleitus, before you ruin your life.
Doesn' t your great pride fear the gods any longer?
This Army, this Army' s your blood, boy!
Without it, you' re nothing!
You no longer serve the purpose of this march!
Get him from my sight!
I don' t serve your purpose?
What was I serving when I saved your puppy life at Gaugamela?
Do you think we' il be forced now to mate with brown apes, to please Your Highness?
Arrest him for treason!
Who' s with him?
I call Father Zeus to witness.
I call you to trial before him!
We' il see how deep this conspiracy cuts!
Take him!
What about poor Parmenion?
You made me do your foul deed.
Despot!
You and your barbarian mother live in shame!
- None can enter, your Highness.
I am the queen!
I' ve waited 3 days.
Not even you.
No.
He doesn' t.
And he needs you?
Hephaistion, you make a mistake.
The Army needs your reassurance......
Alexander.
Yes, like a old lover they forgive, but they will never forget.
You know more than any...... great deeds are done by men who took and never regretted.
You' re Alexander!
Pity and grief will only destroy you.
Have I become so arrogant that I am blind?
Sometimes...... to expect the best of everyone is arrogance.
Then Cleitus spoke true.
I have become a tyrant.
You' re mortal.
And they know it.
And they forgive you because you make them proud of themselves.
I failed, utterly.
Philip, King of Macedonia...... and leader of the Greeks.
All my life I' ve waited to see Greeks grovel with respect for Macedonia.
Today is that day.
They say already, "Philip was a great general...... but Alexander is simply great."
But if you ever insult me again, I' il kill you.
I' ve missed ya!
In the spring, Persia!
You' il command my horse from the right.
I' m honored, Father.
I wouldn' t miss it for all the gold in the world.
Which you one day will have!
He' s drunk so much wine, my poor Philip, he' s lost his mind!
Attalus.
I hope the Prince is enjoying the spectacle as much as our Regent.
He' s very tired.
Royal Guard!
To the arena!
March!
No guard, Your Majesty?
In all this crowd?
Greeks all over the place
Cleitus!
My Cleitus!
This man you can always trust, Alexander!
Treat him as you would me.
He' il guard your back for you.
My people are guard enough today, Cleitus!
Let these Greeks see for themselves how I can walk through my people...... then let them call me "tyrant!"
Bring the Main Guard in after my entry only.
Cleitus, make sure the wine flows steady all day.
I want them to like me.
Weren' t you told?
I go in alone.
You follow with the Main Guard.
Go on.
Father, it' s best I go with you.
Is that what she wants?
Don' t look so hurt all the time, Alexander, be a man!
Count yourself lucky you were here at all today, after your public display!
By Herakles, by Zeus, by all the gods, obey me this once!
Have courage, Father, and go on your way rejoicing that at each step...... you may recall your valor.
And now Our Beloved King, Philip...... in whose honor these wedding games begin!
Pausanias, I told you --
The king lives!
Alexander, son of Philip!
May the gods bless the king!
You' re king.
May the gods bless Alexander!
Get out.
Go.
How can you behave so shamelessly in public?
Because it was meant to be.
No one blames you.
They blame me already behind my back!
Shame is?
Who killed my father?
Tell me, or shall I put you on trial for his murder?
He had help!
Did you help him?
No, never.
Why would I?
So many wanted it, Greeks, Persians, men....
You' re mad!
You' re cursed!
You' ve unleashed Furies, you don' t even know their power!
Now who is exaggerating?
Even if it was the wish of your heart.
That' s a lie!
He was my father, I loved him!
He was not your father!
You owe no blood debt to that man!
You lie and lie and lie!
Look at you.
Look at you, you are everything that he was not.
He was coarse, you are refined.
He was a General, and you are a king!
He could not rule himself...... and you shall rule the world!
You' re so cursed by all the gods when you speak like this.
Such thick pride, and no mourning for your husband.
Mourn... him.
What do you know of Philip?
No, Alexander.
Zeus is your father.
Act like it!
My first act would be to kill you!
You birthed me in a sack of hate...... hate you have for those stronger than you, hate you have for men!
I taught you my heart, Alexander...... and by Zeus and Dionysus, you grew beautiful!
Damn your sorceress soul!
Your soul is mine, Alexander.
No!
You' ve taken from me everything I' ve ever loved and made me you!
Stop it!
You' re a king!
Act like one!
Parmenion is with us, for once!
Execute Attalus without delay, then confiscate their lands, and root out that family forever.
Eurydice?
Never!
Laugh, you monster!
You heartbreaker!
How will you live out the year like this, hm?
Have you learned nothing from Philip?
No, from you, Mother.
The best!
What have I done to make you hate me so?
One day, you will understand this...... but I have only you in my heart...
I know what you need.
Now is the time.
The gods favor you.
Great wealth, power, conquest...... all you desire, the world is yours!
Take it!
Take it.
He never saw his mother again.
And while he was away, fighting the Northern tribes...... Olympias had Philip' s new wife, Eurydice, and her infant son murdered.
By necessity, he had her uncle, Attalus, executed.
Of course you have fears.
We all have fears, because no one has ever gone this far before!
And now we are weeks from the Encircling Ocean, our route home.
We' il build a fleet of ships and sail all the way back down the Nile to Egypt!
And from Alexandria, we shall be home within weeks!
There to be reunited with our loved ones...... to share our great treasures and tales of Asia...... and to enjoy our imperishable glory to the ends of time!
Follow Alexander!
Silence?
We' re with you, Alexander!
A hero!
Where are these great Amazons of myth who dare to fight and kill men?
Where have they gone?
We' il never leave you, Alexander!
You, Meleager...... who are these tribes ahead compared to those we' ve vanquished?
Lysimachus?
Antigonous?
You break my heart.
You men, afraid?
My king.
I don' t like no bellyaching, I won' t tolerate it in any of my units.
But I lost many a man.
Young ones, never been with a woman.
Some died of disease.
Some were butchered in Scythia, by the banks of the Oxus.
Some died good.
Some just didn' t get no luck...... but they died.
40, 000 I come over with eight years ago...... and we march after you, more than ten thousand miles.
In the rain and the sun, we fought for you.
Some of us, fifty battles we' ve been in.
We killed many a barbarian.
And now when I look around, how many of them faces do I see?
And now you want us to fight more of these crazy monkey tribes east of here.
We hear talk of thousands of these elephant monsters, cross a hundred more rivers!
Crateros!
Good Crateros!
Who better than you to speak, most noble of men.
But you know there' s no part of me without a scar or a bone broken.
By sword, knife, stone, catapult, and club...... I' ve shared every hardship with all of you!
Aye, you have, my king, and we love you for it!
But by Zeus, too many have died!
You have no children, Alexander...... and we' re just humble men, we seek no disturbance with the gods.
All we wish for... is to see our children...... and our wives, and our grandchildren, one last time...... before we join our brothers in that dark House they call Hades!
You' re right, Crateros!
I should have sent you veterans home sooner and I will!
The first of you shall be the Silver Shields.
And then every man who' s served 7 years...... with full pensions from our treasury!
And respected...... rich, loved, you' il be treated by your wives and children as heroes... for the rest of your lives...... and enjoy a peaceful death!
But you dream, Crateros!
Your simplicity long ended when you took Persian mistresses and children...... and you thickened your holdings with plunder and jewels...... because you' ve fallen in love with all the things in life that destroy men!
Do you not see!
And you, as well as I, know...... that as the years decline and the memories stale...... and all your great victories fade it will always be remembered, you left your king in Asia!
For I will go on, with my Asians!
To the jackals with you then, Alexander!
We come for you and you discard us!
We want to see our wives and children before we die!
I' ve got children I haven' t even seen!
I' ve taken nothing for myself!
And all I' ve asked of you was one more month!
Shame!
That' s your King!
What would your father say?
I' ve taken you further than my father ever dreamed!
So go home!
I look to the barbarians for their courage!
I go east!
He wants us all dead, so no one can speak of his crimes!
Who said that?
We' il never make it back to Macedonia!
You despicable coward!
Make your accusations public!
So you can have us killed?
Son of Zeus!
You desecrate your real father' s memory
Hide!
Hide in this mob!
You insult my honor and my paternity!
Arrest him!
You call me murderer?
I have no such blood on my hands!
And him.
You mock my shame for Cleitus and say I would harm a hair of my father' s head!
After all I' ve done for you, you swine!
You cowards!
Come on, then!
Where are your daggers?
He drove on, south to the Outer Ocean.
In smashing the mutiny and executing the ringleaders...... he did nothing, to my mind, that any general in wartime would not have done.
But clearly the Army was divided...... and Alexander was no longer loved by all.
Stay calm.
Together we are strong as gods!
Cover with your left...... strike hard with your right.
A waste of time!
Lock shields!
Battle positions!
Move!
Choppers, prepare your knives!
Follow me!
Strike hard, boys!
Come, Macedonians!
Why do you hang back!
Hurry!
Split to thirds!
Regroup and encircle!
No!
Cavalry on me!
Follow Alexander!
Charge!
The phalanx is in jeopardy!
Meleager, ride to Pharnakes and tell him return to the center at once!
Amyntas, find Hephaistion at the riverbank and bring all cavalry to the center!
We must reach Crateros before it' s too late!
To the center!
Come, Macedonians!
Ride!
The horses won' t go!
Fall back!
Come, Bucephalus.
Fear not, my friend...... it is only sun and shadow.
You and I, together, one last time, Bucephalus.
Isn' t it a lovely thing to live with great courage...... and to die living an everlasting fame?
Come, Macedonians, why do you retreat?
Do you want to live forever?
In the name of Zeus, attack!
Attack!
Alexander!
To the King!
Pure butchery...... the end of all reason.
We' d never be men again.
He lives!
Men of Macedon...... we' re going home!
We' re going home!
His life should have ended in India... but that' s myth.
In life, Herakles died of a poisoned shirt...... given him in error by his jealous wife.
Making his devotions to the gods at the end of the great journey...... Alexander bade the East farewell, and marched this army directly west...... across the great Gedrosian Desert...... seeking the shortest route home to Babylon.
To this day, there is no accounting of how many died.
It was the worst blunder of his life.
And when he finally re- entered Babylon, after six years in the far East...... Alexander again seized the imagination of the world...... by taking two more wives.
It' s the water, Your Majesty!
He mixed it with the wine.
But, how can this be?
Typhus, of India?
I wouldn' t tax yourself, Your Majesty.
A few good night' s rest will do it.
But no wine or cold chicken --
I feel better.
Soon, I' il be up.
We leave for Arabia in the spring and I couldn' t leave without you.
Arabia
You used to dress me up like a sheik...... wave your wooden scimitar.
You were the only one who' d never let me win.
The only one who' s ever been honest with me.
You saved me from myself.
Please don' t leave me, Hephaistion.
My Alexander.
I remember the young man who wants to be Achilles...... and then outdid him.
And you Patroclus.
And then what happened?
Ours is a myth only young men believe.
But how beautiful a myth it was.
We reach... we fall.
Oh, Hephaistion!
I am nothing without you!
Come, fight, Hephaistion!
We' il die together.
It' s our destiny.
We' il have children with our wives...... and our sons will play together as we once did.
A thousand ships we' il launch from here, Hephaistion.
We' il round Arabia...... and sail up the Gulf to Egypt.
From there we' il build a channel through the desert and out to the Middle Sea.
And that great island, Sicily, they' il pay large tribute.
After that, the Roman tribe, good fighters!
We' il beat them...... and then explore the northern forests,... and out the Pillars of Herakles to the Western Ocean!
And then one day, not ten years from now...... Babylon, with its deep- water harbor, will be the center of the World!
The Alexandrias will grow, populations will mix and travel freely.
Asia and Europe will come together.
And we' il grow old, Hephaistion...... looking out our balcony at this New World.
Hephaistion?
Hephaistion?
Where is this Doctor?
I can' t explain this, your Majesty.
It' s not possible!
I swear by Apollo --
Execute him!
Take him out, now, and execute him!
Liars!
Get out!
Get out, now!
Harpies!
Get out!
Are you drunk again?
Get out.
- Who?
Many hated him...... but I don' t think any other would have dared!
Hephaistion is dead?
Are you mad?
You monster!
You' ve taken from me all that I' ve ever loved!
May all the Furies through time damn your miserable heart!
Obey me!
I have your child!
Alexander, I have your child!
Alexander, my husband, my King!
My poor, poor, ill- fated son!
Never touch me again!
One last toast...... before the dawn.
To my old... friends!
And to the myths!
Finish it!
To the next dawn!
Yes, come.
I await you.
Your only, loving son.
Wait!
Wait!
Vultures!
Your son, Alexander!
Just three more months!
Please live!
Alexander, we beg you.
Tell us who.
Who will rule this great empire?
Who do you want, Alexander?
Fear not.
We are at the beginning.
The myth becomes real.
I' il be on walls like these.
Zeus is your father!
Satrapies will revolt.
Without your orders, there' il be war.
Pray tell us, who?
What did he say?
To the best.
No, he said, "To Crateros."
Why would he say Crateros?
Babylon, Persia June 323 B. C.
On the 10th of June...... a month short of his 33rd year,
Alexander' s great heart...... finally gave out, and as he vowed, he joined Hephaistion.
But in his short life, he achieved, without doubt...... the mythic glory of his ancestor Achilles...... and more.
His sacrifice was an early death...... but in keeping to his side of the bargain...... I cannot help but feel Alexander conquered Death as well.
Olympias' transgression in the murder of his father...... is to my mind, a probability.
A burden.
Alexander was too in love with glory for him to steal it.
But by blood, and blood alone...... he was guilty.
Within hours, we were fighting like jackals for his corpse.
The wars of the world had begun.
40 years off and on they endured...... Cassander in Greece, Crateros and Antigonous in western Asia...... Solucas and Perdiccas in the East, myself in Egypt...... until we divided his Empire in four parts.
Gentlemen, we are not savages!
Cassander certainly proved his will to power...... when seven years later, he had Olympias executed.
And within twelve years, he achieved...... the complete destruction of Alexander' s bloodline...... when he poisoned Roxane and Alexander' s thirteen- year- old son...... the true heir to the Empire.
But the truth is never simple...... and yet it is.
The truth is, we did kill him.
By silence, we consented.
Because we couldn' t go on.
What did we have to look forward to but to be discarded in the end like Cleitus!
After all this time, to give away our wealth to Asian sycophants we despised?
Mixing the races, "harmony", pah!
But wasn' t it really about Alexander, and another population ready to obey him?
I never believed in his dream.
None of us did.
That' s the truth of his life.
The dreamers exhaust us.
They must die before they kill us with their blasted dreams!
Just throw all that away, Cadmos.
It' s an old fool' s rubbish.
You shall write,
He died of fever and a weakened condition.
He could' ve stayed home in Macedonia, married, raised a family.
He' d have died a celebrated man.
But this was not Alexander.
All his life...... he fought to free himself from fear.
And by this, and this alone, he was made free...... the freest man I' ve ever known!
His tragedy was one of increasing loneliness...... and impatience with those who could not understand.
And if his desire to reconcile Greek and barbarian...... ended in failure...... well, what failure!
His failure towered over other men' s successes.
I' ve lived long life, Cadmos...... but the glory and the memory of man...... will always belong to the ones who follow their great visions.
And the greatest of these is the one they now call...... "Megas Alexandros".
The greatest Alexander of them all.
Men are haunted by the vastness of eternity.
And so we ask ourselves...... will our actions echo across the centuries?
Will strangers hear our names long after we' re gone...... and wonder who we were...... how bravely we fought...... how fiercely we loved?
Good day for the crows.
Remove your army from my land.
I like your land.
I like your soldiers too.
They won' t fight for you.
And the Arcadians and the Epeians.
Now they all fight for me.
You can' t have the whole world, Agamemnon.
It' s too big, even for you.
I don' t want to watch another massacre.
Let' s settle this war in the old manner.
Your best fighter against my best.
And if my man wins?
We' il leave Thessaly for good.
Boagrius!
Achilles!
Boagrius has this effect on many heroes.
Careful who you insult, old king.
My king, Achilles is not with the army.
- Where is he?
- I sent a boy to look for him.
I was having a good dream.
Very good dream.
King Agamemnon sent me.
I' il speak to your king in the morning.
But my lord, it is morning.
They' re waiting for you.
Are the stories about you true?
They say your mother is an immortal goddess.
They say you can' t be killed.
I wouldn' t be bothering with the shield then, would I?
The Thessalonian you' re fighting...... he' s the biggest man I' ve ever seen.
I wouldn' t want to fight him.
That' s why no one will remember your name.
Perhaps we should have our war tomorrow, when you' re better rested.
I should have you whipped for your impudence!
Perhaps you should fight him.
Achilles.
You can save hundreds of them.
You can end this war with a swing of your sword.
Let them go home to their wives.
Imagine a king who fights his own battles.
Wouldn' t that be a sight.
Of all the warlords loved by the gods, I hate him the most.
Is there no one else?
Is there no one else?
Who are you, soldier?
Son of Peleus.
Achilles?
I' il remember the name.
The ruler of Thessaly carries this scepter.
Give it to your king.
He' s not my king.
B rothers in arms!
- Friendship!
- Friendship!
Princes of Troy, on our last night together...... Queen Helen and I salute you.
We' ve had our conflicts before, it' s true.
We fought many battles, Sparta and Troy.
And fought well!
But I have always respected your father.
Priam is a good king, a good man.
I respect him now as my ally.
Stand.
Drink with me.
Let us drink to peace.
To peace between Troy and Sparta.
May the gods keep the wolves in the hills and the women in our beds.
- For the gods.
- For the gods.
You shouldn' t be here.
That' s what you said last night.
Last night was a mistake.
And the night before?
I' ve made many mistakes this week.
Do you want me to go?
Pearls from the Sea of Propontis.
They' re beautiful.
But I can' t wear them.
Menelaus would kill us both.
Don' t be afraid of him.
I' m not afraid of dying.
I' m afraid of tomorrow.
I' m afraid of watching you sail away and knowing you' il never come back.
Before you came to Sparta, I was a ghost.
I walked, and I ate, and I swam in the sea...... but I was just a ghost.
You don' t have to fear tomorrow.
Come with me.
Don' t play.
But I' il love you.
Till the day they burn my body...... I will love you.
Poseidon has blessed our voyage.
Sometimes the gods bless you in the morning and curse you in the afternoon.
Drop sail!
Do you love me, brother?
Would you protect me against any enemy?
The last time you spoke to me like this...... you were 10 years old, and you' d just stolen Father' s horse.
What have you done now?
I must show you something.
Where is she?
I swear by the father of the gods, I will gut you here if you don' t tell me!
My king!
She left.
The fisherman here saw her board their ship.
With the young prince, Paris.
She...
Get my ship ready.
Turn us round.
High on the sail!
- Wait, wait.
- You fool!
- Listen to me.
- Do you know what you' ve done?
Do you know how many years our father worked for peace?
I love her.
You think you know something about love.
You spat on him when you brought her on this ship!
What about the love for your country?
You' d let Troy burn for this woman?
I won' t let you start a war for her.
May I speak?
What you' re saying is true.
I' ve wronged our father.
If you want to take Helen back to Sparta, so be it.
But I go with her.
To Sparta?
They' il kill you.
Then I' il die fighting.
Oh, and that sounds heroic to you, doesn' t it?
To die fighting.
- Little brother, have you ever killed a man?
- No.
- No.
And I' ve watched them dying.
Nothing poetic.
You say you want to die for love.
And you know nothing about love!
All the same, I go with her.
I won' t ask you to fight my war.
You already have.
To Troy!
- I want her back.
- Well, of course you do.
She' s a beautiful woman.
I want her back so I can kill her with my own two hands.
I won' t rest till I' ve burned Troy to the ground.
I thought you wanted peace with Troy.
I should have listened to you.
Peace is for the women...... and the weak.
Empires are forged by war.
All my life, I' ve stood by your side, fought your enemies.
You' re the elder, you reap the glory.
This is the way of the world.
But have I ever complained?
Have I ever asked you for anything?
Never.
You' re a man of honor.
Will you go to war with me, brother?
I always thought my brother' s wife was a foolish woman...... but she' s proved to be very useful.
The Trojans have never been conquered.
Some say they can' t be conquered.
Old King Priam thinks he' s untouchable behind his high walls.
He thinks the sun god will protect him.
But the gods protect only...... the strong!
If Troy falls...... I control the Aegean.
Hector commands the finest army in the east.
I' il attack them with the greatest force the world has ever seen.
One last thing.
We need Achilles and his Myrmidons.
Achilles.
He can' t be controlled.
He' s as likely to fight us as the Trojans.
We don' t need to control him, we need to unleash him.
That man was born to end lives.
Yes, he' s a gifted killer.
But he threatens everything I' ve built.
Before me, Greece was nothing.
I created a nation out of fire worshipers and snake eaters!
I build the future, Nestor.
Me!
Achilles is the past.
A man who fights for no flag.
A man loyal to no country.
How many battles have we won off the edge of his sword?
This will be the greatest war the world has ever seen.
We need the greatest warrior.
There' s only one man he' il listen to.
Never hesitate.
Nervous?
Petrified.
You told me never to change sword hands.
Yes.
When you know how to use it, you won' t be taking my orders.
Your reputation for hospitality is fast becoming legend.
Patroclus, my cousin.
Odysseus, king of lthaca.
I miss them.
Now you have this one watching over you, eh?
Learning from Achilles himself.
Kings would kill for the honor.
Are you here at Agamemnon' s bidding?
We need to talk.
I will not fight for him.
I' m not asking you to fight for him.
I' m asking you to fight for the Greeks.
Are the Greeks tired of fighting each other?
- The Trojans never harmed me.
They insulted a man who couldn' t hold on to his wife.
Your business is war, my friend.
Is it?
The man has no honor.
Let Achilles fight for honor.
Let Agamemnon fight for power.
And let the gods decide which man to glorify.
- For the Greeks!
Fight for me.
My wife will feel much better if she knows you' re by my side.
I' il feel much better.
A thousand ships.
Prince Hector.
Is he as good a warrior as they say?
Some say he' s better than all the Greeks too.
Even if your cousin doesn' t come...... I hope you' il join us.
We could use a strong arm like yours.
Play your tricks on me, but not my cousin.
You have your swords.
I have my tricks.
We play with the toys the gods give us.
We sail for Troy in three days.
This war will never be forgotten.
Nor will the heroes who fight in it.
I knew they would come for you.
Long before you were born...... I knew they would come.
They want you to fight in Troy.
I' m making you another seashell necklace.
Like the ones I made you when you were a boy.
Do you remember?
Mother...... tonight, I decide.
If you stay in Lárisa...... you will find peace.
You will find a wonderful woman.
You will have sons and daughters, and they will have children.
When you are gone, they will remember you.
But when your children are dead and their children after them...... your name will be lost.
If you go to Troy...... glory will be yours.
They will write stories about your victories for thousands of years.
The world will remember your name.
But if you go to Troy...... you will never come home.
For your glory walks hand in hand with your doom.
And I shall never see you again.
- My son.
- Father.
Paris.
Father.
- This is Helen.
- Helen?
Helen of Sparta?
Helen of Troy.
I' ve heard rumors of your beauty.
For once...... the gossips were right.
Welcome.
Come, you must be tired.
Look.
He' s grown.
He is strong.
- Briseis!
- Paris!
Beloved cousin, your beauty grows with each new moon.
Briseis.
A servant of Apollo now.
The young men of Troy were devastated when Briseis chose the virgin robes.
Father...... I know this is the last thing we need.
It is the will of the gods.
Everything is in their hands.
- But I' m surprised you let him bring her.
- Lf I' d let him fight Menelaus for her...... you' d be burning a son' s body, not welcoming a daughter.
We could send peace envoys to Menelaus.
You know Menelaus.
He' d spear their heads to his gate.
What would you have me do?
Put her on a ship and send her home.
Women have always loved Paris, and he has loved them back.
Something has changed in him.
If we send her home to Menelaus, he will follow her.
This is my country, and these are my countrymen.
I don' t want to see them suffer so my brother can have his prize.
It' s not just the Spartans coming after her.
By now, Menelaus has gone to Agamemnon.
And Agamemnon has wanted to destroy us for years.
Our walls still stand.
Father, we can' t win this war.
Apollo watches over us.
Even Agamemnon is no match for the gods.
And how many battalions does the sun god command?
Do not mock the gods.
They' re coming for me.
The wind is bringing them closer.
What if we left?
Tonight.
Right now.
What if we went down to the stables, took two horses and left?
Ride east, keep riding.
- And go where?
- Away from here.
I could hunt deer, rabbit.
I could feed us.
But this is your home.
You left your home for me.
Sparta was never my home.
My parents sent my there when I was 16 to marry Menelaus.
But it was never my home.
We' il live off the land.
No more servants.
We don' t need any of that.
And your family?
If we' re not here, what' s the need for war?
Menelaus won' t give up.
He' il track us to the end of the world.
I do.
We can lose ourselves in a day.
You don' t know Menelaus.
You don' t know his brother.
They' il burn every house in Troy to find us.
And even if they do, they' il burn it for spite.
Then I' il make it easy for him to find me.
I' il walk right up to him and tell him you' re mine.
You' re very young, my love.
My lord?
Should we wait for the others?
- They brought us here for war.
- Yes, but Agamemnon' s orders...
You fight for me, Eudorus, or Agamemnon?
For you, my lord.
Then fight for me.
And let the servants of Agamemnon fight for him.
Black sail.
It' s Achilles.
What' s the fool doing?
He' s going to take the beach of Troy with 50 men?
Make way there!
Make way!
Tecton, is the Apollonian Guard ready?
- Good.
I' il be right there.
Lysander, how long before the army is ready?
Half of our men are still coming.
We have to arm them...
- How long?
- Noon.
Make it sooner.
Patroclus!
Put down your spear.
- I' m fighting the Trojans.
- Not today.
You taught me how to fight.
And you' re a good student.
But you' re not a Myrmidon yet.
Look at these men.
Each of them has bled for me.
- Guard the ship.
- But this is a war.
Cousin, I can' t fight the Trojans if I' m concerned for you.
Guard the ship.
Trojans!
All my life, I' ve lived by a code.
Honor the gods, love your woman...... and defend your country.
Fight for her!
Myrmidons...... my brothers of the sword.
I' d rather fight beside you than any army of thousands.
We are lions!
Do you know what' s there, waiting, beyond that beach?
Lmmortality!
Take it!
It' s yours!
Fight positions!
Archers!
Forward!
The man wants to die.
On my command!
Break off!
Break off!
Look at him.
Look.
Row, you lazy whores, row!
Greeks are dying!
Row!
Those men down there need help.
Tecton, with me.
Flank!
To the flank!
Back to the city!
Back to the city!
The sun god is a patron of Troy, our enemy.
Take whatever treasure you can find.
With your permission, my lord.
- Speak.
- Apollo sees everything.
Perhaps it is not wise to offend him.
Warn the men.
Wait.
You are very brave or very stupid to come after me alone.
You must be Hector.
Do you know who I am?
These priests weren' t armed.
Fight me!
Why kill you now, prince of Troy...... with no one here to see you fall?
Why did you come here?
They' il be talking about this war for 1000 years.
In 1000 years, the dust from our bones will be gone.
Yes, prince.
But our names will remain.
Go home, prince.
Drink some wine, make love to your wife.
Tomorrow, we' il have our war.
You speak of war as if it' s a game.
How many wives wait at Troy' s gates for husbands they' il never see again?
Your brother can comfort them.
I hear he' s good at charming other men' s wives.
My lord, you let him go?
It' s too early in the day for killing princes.
Achilles!
Achilles!
- Achilles.
- Ajax.
You' re as fearless as the gods.
I' m honored to go to war with you.
As am I.
If you sailed slower, the war would be over.
I' il miss the start as long as I' m here at the end.
I' ve got something to show you.
The men found her hiding in the temple.
They thought she' d...... amuse you.
What' s your name?
Did you not hear me?
You killed Apollo' s priests.
I' ve killed men in five countries, never a priest.
Well, then your men did.
The sun god will have his vengeance.
What' s he waiting for?
The right time to strike.
His priests are dead, and his acolyte' s a captive.
- I think your god is afraid of me.
- Afraid?
Apollo is master of the sun.
He fears nothing.
- Where is he?
- You' re nothing but a killer!
You wouldn' t know anything about the gods.
I know more about the gods than your priests.
I' ve seen them.
You' re royalty, aren' t you?
Spent years talking down to men.
You must be royalty.
What' s your name?
Even the servants of Apollo have names.
Briseis.
Are you afraid, Briseis?
Should I be?
My lord.
Agamemnon requests your presence.
The kings are gathering to celebrate the victory.
You fought well today.
My lord.
What do you want here in Troy?
You didn' t come for the Spartan queen.
I want what all men want.
I just want it more.
You don' t need to fear me, girl.
You' re the only Trojan who can say that.
You have won a great victory, my king of kings.
No one thought the Trojan beach could be captured so easily.
A beautiful gift, Triopas.
You will be among the first to walk in the streets of Troy tomorrow.
My father, Neleus, had this urn made to commemorate his victory at Cyparisseis.
I present it to you...... in honor of an even more memorable victory.
Thank you, old friend.
Tomorrow, we' il eat supper in the gardens of Troy.
Leave us.
War is young men dying and old men talking.
You know this.
Ignore the politics.
Apparently, you won some great victory.
Perhaps you didn' t notice.
The Trojan beach belonged to Priam in the morning.
It belongs to Agamemnon in the afternoon.
Have the beach.
I didn' t come here for sand.
No.
You came here because you want your name to last through the ages.
A great victory was won today.
But that victory is not yours.
Kings did not kneel to Achilles.
Kings did not pay homage to Achilles.
Perhaps the kings were too far behind to see.
Soldiers won the battle.
History remembers kings!
Not soldiers.
Tomorrow, we' il batter down the gates of Troy.
I' il build monuments on every island of Greece.
I' il carve "Agamemnon" in the stone.
Be careful, king of kings.
First, you need the victory.
Your men sacked the temple of Apollo, yes?
You want gold?
Take it.
It' s my gift to honor your courage.
Take what you wish.
I already have.
Aphareus!
Haemon!
The spoils of war.
No argument wit you, but if you don' t release her, you' il never see home again.
- Decide.
- Guards!
Stop!
Too many men have died today.
If killing is your only talent, that' s your curse.
I don' t want anyone dying for me.
Mighty Achilles, silenced by a slave girl.
Tonight, I' il have her give me a bath.
And then...... who knows?
Before my time is done, I will look down on your corpse and smile.
If they want a war, we will give them a war.
I would match the best of Troy against the best of Greece any day.
You have fought with me for 40 years.
Can we win this war?
Our walls have never been breached.
We have the finest archers in the world.
And we have Hector.
Yes, we can win.
I spoke to two farmers today.
They saw an eagle flying with a serpent clutched in its talons.
This is a sign from Apollo.
We will win a great victory tomorrow.
Bird signs.
You want to plan a strategy based on bird signs.
Hector, show respect.
The high priest is a servant of the gods.
And I am a servant of Troy.
I' ve always honored the gods, Father.
But today I fought a Greek who desecrated the statue of Apollo.
Apollo didn' t strike the man down.
The gods won' t fight this war for us.
There won' t be a war.
This is not a conflict of nations.
It is a dispute between two men.
I don' t want to see another Trojan die because of me.
Paris.
Tomorrow morning, I will challenge Menelaus for the right to Helen.
The winner will take her home.
The loser will burn before nightfall.
Father...... I' m sorry for the pain I' ve caused you.
Do you love her?
You are a great king because you love your country so much.
Every blade of grass.
Every grain of sand.
Every rock in the river.
You love all of Troy.
That is the way I love Helen.
I' ve fought many wars in my time.
Some were fought for land, some for power, some for glory.
I suppose fighting for love makes more sense than all the rest.
But I won' t be the one fighting.
The sword of Troy.
My father carried this sword, and his father before him...... all the way back to the founding of Troy.
The history of our people was written with this sword.
Carry it with you tomorrow.
The spirit of Troy is in that sword.
So long as a Trojan carries it...... our people have a future.
The man who killed Tecton outside Apollo' s temple...... I' ve never seen a spear thrown like that.
An impossible throw.
Don' t go tomorrow.
- Please don' t go.
- Paris fights tomorrow, not me.
Fifty thousand Greeks didn' t cross the sea to watch your brother fight.
You know this.
You' d make a fine general, my love.
You' ve been fighting your whole life.
Let other men do battle this time.
You know I don' t want to fight.
I want to see my son grow tall.
I want to see the girls chasing after him.
I can' t lose you.
I won' t survive.
I must see Paris.
Wait.
Wait!
Helen, what are you doing?
- Let me go.
- No.
I saw them burn.
I saw them burning on the pyres.
That' s my fault.
It is.
You know it is.
All those widows.
I still hear them screaming.
Their husbands died because I' m here.
No, you' re not.
- I' m giving myself back to Menelaus.
- It' s too late for that.
Do you think Agamemnon cares about his brother' s marriage?
This is about power.
Not love.
Paris is going to fight in the morning.
- Yes.
- Menelaus will kill him.
I won' t let that happen.
- It' s his decision.
- No.
I can' t ask anyone to fight for me.
I' m no longer queen of Sparta.
You' re a princess of Troy now...... and my brother needs you tonight.
My lord.
My lord, the army is marching.
- Let them march.
We stay.
- But the men are ready.
We stay till Agamemnon groans to have Achilles back.
As you wish.
Are you ready to fight?
Are you ready to kill?
To take life?
I am.
At night, I see their faces, all the men I' ve killed.
They' re standing there on the far bank of the River Styx.
They' re waiting for me.
They say, "Welcome, brother."
We men are wretched things.
I taught you how to fight, but I never taught you why to fight.
I fight for you.
Who will you fight for when I' m gone?
Soldiers, they fight for kings they' ve never even met.
They do what they' re told, die when they' re told to.
Soldiers obey.
Don' t waste your life following some fool' s orders.
Go.
Are you sure you want to do this?
I started this war.
Helen...... sit with me.
Move.
Valiant of you.
Ill- advised, but valiant.
You come here uninvited.
Go back to your ships and go home.
We' ve come too far, Prince Hector.
Prince?
What prince?
What son of a king would accept a man' s hospitality...... eat his food, drink his wine, then steal his wife in the middle of the night?
The sun was shining when your wife left you.
She' s up there, watching, isn' t she?
Good.
I want her to watch you die.
Not yet, brother.
Look around you, Hector.
I brought all the warriors of Greece to your shores.
You can still save Troy, young prince.
I have two wishes.
If you grant them, no more of your people need die.
First, you must give Helen back to my brother.
Second, Troy must submit to my command...... to fight for me whenever I call.
You want me to look upon your army and tremble?
Well, I see them.
I see 50, 000 men brought here to fight for one man' s greed.
Careful, boy.
My mercy has limits.
And I' ve seen the limits of your mercy.
And I tell you now, no son of Troy will ever submit to a foreign ruler.
Then every son of Troy shall die.
There is another way.
I love Helen.
I won' t give her up and neither will you.
So let us fight our own battle.
And let that be the end of it.
A brave offer, but not enough.
Let me kill this little peacock.
I didn' t come here for your pretty wife.
I came here for Troy.
I came for my honor.
His every breath insults me.
Let me kill him.
When he' s lying in the dust, signal to attack.
I' il have my revenge.
So be it.
I accept your challenge.
And tonight, I' il drink to your bones.
- My lord.
- Back to the line!
He' il tire.
Tell her...
I will.
Don' t let Menelaus hurt her.
If he...
You think of your sword and his sword and nothing else.
Get up.
Come on.
I would like to suggest, Emperor, that you reconsider your plan.
The scientists are comparing it to Russian roulette.
What theories we have on phenomena like the maggot hole - indicate a tendency for continually increasing disturbances.
So what else is new.
Can we pass through there?
Our ships weren' t designed for twist pressures over one googol fluxoms.
So in other words, you don' t have a clue.
Why' s everybody talk back all the time?
Try walking in my shoes!
It' s no cakewalk, managin 'the whole world by myself.
Gotta admit, sometimes I think I' ve gotten in too deep.
My ship blew up and I was stuck in the past.
My remaining crew and I went native -
'cos otherwise, we' d have changed the course of history.
The only good thing in the life of the man in the street was burgers.
Hullo.
I' m Captain Pirk, by the way.
I' m from the future.
Look, I' ve got a ray gun.
What?
It' s a hand twinkler, stoopid!
- Right.
I got a communicator, too.
I' il call Info.
He can prove I' m who I say.
Don' t bother...
This is a place for people to eat, not for you to play with yer balls.
Look where you' re going, asshole.
Keep away or I' il shoot!
- Look, a Super Soaker.
It' s a hand twinkler, you dumbass!
And I got a bag of whoopass for you!
Ya gonna get your baggy ass whooped.
The batteries are shot.
Oh Thursday, no!
Bobby' s Grill.
Pirk to Dwarf.
It' s been a while.
Yeah, well, Info' s been going on about messing with the timeline.
- Same here.
Old Earth much more boring than its barbarous reputation would suggest.
Just a second, Sir.
That' s three hot dogs and a sausage roll, to eat here?
One minute...
Sorry, Sir. These morons won' t let me have a moment' s rest.
And don' t throw up everywhere!
We' re closed!
Listen, I' m tired of waiting.
We need to plan our next move.
Hot dogs!
Right.
I' il call him just as soon as I can rid these dimwits!
Lily- livered kids!
I' il make hot dogs of your intestines!
The arrival of the Vulgars shoulda been a new beginning for humanity.
When they happened along, they ended up with rock star Jeff Cochbrane.
It was a mistake, leaving 'em in the care of that drunkard idiot.
Soon, the Vulgars could care less about humanity or new beginnings.
Good thing I had a backup plan.
But I couldn' t do it without Dwarf and Info' s help.
I hope you have a good reason.
We may be endangering the timeline.
Take a look at this!
"Lesbian housewives getting busy?"
At this, I mean.
What an unexpected development.
The entire space program cancelled!
Not like the history we know.
The antimaterial power breakthrough should have been announced today.
That' s why we have to do something.
We' il make the P- Fleet happen!
Your proposal is in direct violation of the First Directive!
If we don' t, the timeline' s history!
We' il have to have peace, universal language, tights for uniforms, - and a defense against the Korg!
As the only Captain, I' m ordering - that we' il ensure the founding of the P- Fleet, by any means necessary!
Future technology in the hands of these people could spell disaster.
That' s why the world needs a strong leader.
Someone like... me!
I' m gonna be Emperor.
One heavy cruiser should be enough to conquer this world.
- Unfortunately we do not have one.
And we cannot build one without an antimaterial powerplant.
But I know where we can get one.
Gimme that phone.
Cochbrane.
Oh, it' s you... hi.
Listen, where' s the ship?
- What, the Vulgar rocket- ship?
We sold it to some Russian scientist type for top dollar.
Who?
- Vladimir something, I forget.
Where' s this Vladimir live then?
- Chanistanya Nuclear Plant, I think.
Who the hell gave you permission to sell the ship, you son of a bitch?
Well thanks the same, you...
The junkie bastard sold the ship to the Russians!
Goddammit!
Now what do we do?
- We' re off to Russia, numbskull.
Luckily the missing Vulgar ship was surprisingly quickly located.
It was the only thing on the planet that could let me build my flagship.
What' s ze problem?
Bloody Western teknology!
Vladimir!
Ze reaktor is overheating!
Ze kooling system is on ze fritz!
Damnation!
And ze kontrol system is lokking up again.
Sergey!
Sergey!
Where are you, Sergey?
- What?
You used to work at a nuklear plant?
- Yeah, the Chernobyl facility. Why?
Kooling system problems, but that' s what you do best, right?
Go check out the reaktor chamber.
- Gee, thanks.
Chernobyl. Why' s zat sound familiar?
CHERNOBYL!
Fukoooov!
Piece of pie.
Make damn sure you never touch the kooling system again, Sergey!
Yeah!
- Yes, Sir, Captain.
I thought it was the climate control for my quarters.
Do exactly what I say, or it' s whoopass time!
Is it a revolution?
At last!
Ze Soviet Union will be reborn!
We will be free from ze yoke of kapitalism!
Aren' t they gonna put up a fight?
Okay:
I' m Emperor Pirk, and we' il build a new ship here in Tachanya - and with it, a brave new Empire!
So that' s how it got started.
The nearby village had the space and the manpower to found the P- Fleet.
Info got the flagship project to lead, I had better things to do.
I told 'em to be ready in 6 months, but they wasted years of my time!
I realized I had to be a charismatic leader, so the flab had to go.
It was hard work, but my determination paid off.
The ElectroForce ButtDoer!
Order Now, for only 5, 999 roubles!
Took your sweet time, didn' t you?
The negotiations with the Russian President had also gone well.
My plan hinged on having a powerful ally.
Ah, what an entrance.
A pleasure to meet you at last!
Sure...
I' ve got our contract here.
I' il just look this over...
Everything seems to be as agreed...
I' il just sign it.
Igor, a pen!
We will make this world a better place!
The alliance with Russia made it possible to begin war preparations.
No pain, no gain!
You' il never make real soldiers!
The moment of truth finally arrived.
With our forces ready to rumble, it was time to play our trump card: - the flagship of the P- Fleet, the CPP Kickstart.
Lookin 'good!
Tactical is still missing a chair!
Now, we wouldn' t want your powerful thigh muscles to atrophy.
Are we all set to go?
Power level at 96. 3 percent.
Were there any questions?
So you' re the famous Emperor Pirk?
This is me, in all my glory.
Right...
Let' s move!
I don' t think I' m in Moscow anymore.
Welcome aboard the CPP Kickstart.
Perhaps Mr President would like to witness the capabilities my ship.
This is an honor!
First we' il pay the Yanks a visit.
Full twist, now!
What is it this time?
Russian workmanship at its finest!
Due to impure antimaterial gas, we can only achieve Twist Factor Two.
Nyet!
One moment! What are you...?
- Fire twinklers and light balls!
Billions of roubles went into it!
Relax, Gramps. We' il build a newer and better one.
The beginning of the 3rd Millennium: poverty, famine, disease.
Leaders spoke of freedom, but sent children to die in meaningless wars.
Mother Russia nurtured a new hero from the ranks of the oppressed.
Side by side, Emperor Pirk and President Ulyanov led the way.
The road was long, but working hard, we proved that nothing is impossible.
We were ready for humanity' s final battle.
Our men sallied forth to liberate our oppressed Northern brethren.
Together, the brave men of Russia and the technology of tomorrow - shook the old world to the core.
Reactionaries were swept away before the cunning of Emperor Pirk.
Their leaders, faced with certain defeat, deserted their cities.
But Europe could no longer offer them sanctuary.
Our victorious armies, headed for a better world, shook our enemies - with the marching of a million feet.
Soon, the stakes were driven to the heart of the Old Continent.
With Europe liberated, the people of the world turned their attention - to that old devil, the United States of America.
They filled the skies with death, and were undone by it.
We taught that monster of old the true meaning of freedom.
The time was right for a brave new empire: - the P- Fleet was born.
Get your hands off!.
Get off!.
You... you snake, you tyrant.
We had an agreement, you traitor!
No, no!
That' s how I became Emperor of the world.
A fleet of warships was built with the combined resorts of the Earth.
Gotta be ready if some slime- faces from outer space come callin '!
Really, I did all I could for mankind, but did anybody thank me?
No, they just whined about famine and overpopulation and stuff.
What' s this racket?
Down with Pirk!
Down with Pirk!
So I thought of a solution: expand to other planets.
Only our primitive ships couldn' t go very far, and - closer planets weren' t habitable.
We did try one or two, but without too much luck.
The CPP Kalinka was a cheap bucket - tasked to patrol the backwaters for a few years or until it rusted out.
The captain was just the man for the job.
Capt Sergey Fukov of the CPP Kalinka to unidentified vessel: -
I... identify yourselves!
- Third directive of Emperor Pirk: -
How odd...
I scanned the ship right before the explosion.
I dunno.
Let' s call the Emperor!
Now what?
- We saw a ship in Epsilon Ouadrant.
Huh?
- Dunno who it was, we destroyed it!
See you in court martial!
Oww, shit!
Who the hell hired YOU, anyway?
But it wasn' t one of ours!
I could lose my sight, you know!
And who left the soap on the floor?
Now what?!
- We had a meeting at two o' clock.
Didn' t it occur to you it might be two PM, wiseguy?
Your expression was ambiguous, Sir.
- Riight...
- What about it?
Considering the possible vectors and size of the ship they encountered, - the ship must have originated near the other end of the maggot hole.
Yeah, yeah, get to the point.
There must be an unknown human civilization that built the ship.
Considering our tough situation...
-... We can take over their planets!
I would have asked them for aid.
- Well it' s not your decision.
Prepare the fleet for battle!
Capt...
Captains of the P- Fleet. You have been assembled for a reason.
We' il take it, by force, if need be!
You have your order papers.
Fukov!
Interrupt me again, and I' il have you scrubbing bulkheads again!
You' re sitting on top of' em.
All available ships will be used, so there' s no room for failure!
That' s why I' m leading the mission myself.
There goes our last hope for victory...
We' re leaving tomorrow morning, at six o' clock.
Any questions?
Ambassador Flush, welcome aboard the Babel 1 3.
Yes
We weren' t expecting you for...
May I ask?
It' s nothing.
Jonny!
Sorry to interrupt.
This is our Chief of Security, Mikhail Garybrandy.
Look sharp, this is an important...
- What' re you going on about?
Lt Kefir took a Star Flurry for a drunken joyride last night.
Why didn' t you stop him?
- I was so dru... dreadfully tired.
Where' s Kefir now?
In the morning, I sent a patrol out.
This is all they found.
Oh my God.
- What?
Aliens have crystallized Kefir!
Jonny, this is a data crystal.
Crystallized Kefir...
Scream my rank!
Where did that ship come from?
- Dunno.
But it sure is butt- ugly.
Could it mean...
The prophecies of the Minibar are coming true.
A great darkness will come, and we' re all going to die.
"The One to rule them all and in the darkness bind them", I' ve read it.
Now, let' s get back to reality, huh?
An itching nose must be scratched.
There you have it, Mikhail!
We have to trust the instincts that served our ancestors so well.
Ivanovitsa, we need reinforcements.
Call in all ships in the vicinity.
- Yes, Sir.
I have a bad feeling about this.
This is where it happened.
Let' s get cracking.
Fukov, you go in first.
We do not know if a starship can survive entering that maggot hole.
That' s exactly why Fukov is going first!
Oh yeah?
Well thanks a lot!
Message from the Kalinka: all clear.
Raise deflector plates and arm weapons.
We' re going after 'em!
Dammit, it' s like sailing thru Jello.
Info, condensate, do something!
Compensating by angling Hindenburg stabilizers across the ion field.
The Ouarton crystals should reach the correct frequency right... now.
Yeah. Whatever.
Sir, unidentified craft detected!
They disappeared.
But there ain' t no planets in all this red Jello.
Apparently, the ships activated some kind of local twist in space.
We can duplicate the energy burst, which should open a similar twist...
Stop yammering and just do it.
Helm, take us after them!
That was the last of our reinforcements.
Now, we can...
Hopgate opening, craft coming through.
How many?
- Forty. Type: unknown.
Blast...
If I' d only known when I accepted command of this station...
I' d have done so with all the more zeal! We' re here to keep the peace - and even if it meant killing every sentient being in the galaxy, we...
Captain, this is hardly the time.
- This is a question of principle.
It is my right to make speeches, and I swear that no- one will deny me it.
Not an enemy fleet, and especially not some embittered Commander - who likes to chew out garbage scow captains docking in handicap spaces!
Is that clear?
Sir, we' re being hailed.
- Oh... well, put it on the telly.
This is Capt Sherrypie of the Babel 13.
Please identify yourselves.
They look just like people!
This is Emperor Pirk, Supreme Commander of the P- Fleet.
Info, that' s a space station, right?
Is the planet habitable?
Not according to the scanners, Sir.
- Shoulda known...
We just came to say hello, since we happened to be close...... us and the fleet.
Where are you guys from, anyway?
This station is neutral territory.
- Huh?
We haven' t been here before?
Emperor, I assume we have arrived in a mirror dimension of our own world.
Historical events may be different here, but some similarities exist.
So do you know where their Earth is?
In theory, yes, assuming that our star- charts have the same stars.
Another Earth...
We' il conquer that!
We' il secure this end of the maggot hole - that tube can' t be too hard...
Emperor! The line is still open.
- I knew that.
The day I joined the military, my father told me: -
But you' re human, Earth to Earth and all that.
So show some spine and come out and stop being a shame on your old man.
Tell me, can we beat them?
Given that we have deflector plates and they do not, it is possible...
Yes, or no?
- Yes.... Mother Earth needs you today! "
Bring us to light ball range and contact the rest of the fleet.... so I came out and gave the blood sample.
Open fire at maximum range.
Everyone pick targets and wait for my signal.... and I know every man, woman and child on this station feels the same.
The only way you can conquer Earth is over our dead bodies!
Know that you shall pay dearly for every cubic inch of our space.
We will fight you with sticks and stones, or even with our bare hands.
The forces of darkness shall move no further!
And if it took a thousand...
Fire.... as a shining beacon in the night!
... in the face of beatniks from another dimension...
What the hell!
Close the blast doors!
Activate the defense grid!
Nice speech, Sir.
Message from the Backgammon:
Amigo class destroyers have reached optimal firing range.
They' re to attack the heavier ships.
That' il show them we mean business.
Fire!
Saucer section penetrated!
Serious damage to all decks!
What' s with my deflector plates?!
Fascinating!
Our plates never even registered the penetrating energy.
Skipper, the hull' s taen a paikin, an the whisky barrels teuk a hit.
Gien some duct tape and twa oors...
You got two minutes!
Fall back!
All ships, cover me!
Emperor, I just learned that we only have three light balls left.
I' m filing a formal complaint!
- Quit bitching and use twinklers.
The Backgammon is being overpowered... and we can' t last long, either.
The Backgammon is being overpowered... and we can' t last long, either.
Damn, this doesn' t look good.
- You don' t mean --
Yes. We have to stall for time.
I' m giving a speech!
Wait... the station is hailing us.
A recording of Sherrypie begging for mercy would have propaganda value.
Well receive it then if it' il shut you up.
Babel 1 3 surrenders.
Don' t shoot, we have over 250, 000 civilians here.
What do I care about your civilians?
And why would I be interested in a chock- full hunk o' junk of a station?
Why don' t you bring your crew over for some shore leave?
You could also repair your fleet...
And shore leave can wait until after we' ve taken your Earth.
Also, you could personally take Ivanovitsa' s virginity!
Well... lemme consider this.
Oh, and throw all your guns out the airlock.
It' s an obvious trap!
We' il take a couple sledfuls of security guards.
The crew must have some time off.
And these ships could use repairs.
Figures.
We accept your terms.
Babel 1 3 is now officially part of the P- Fleet, renamed...... the "Praise of Pirk' s Greatness."
And no tricks, or you' re toast!
Pirk out.
Dwarf, order all able security guys to the sledbay.
You, and Info will stay on the Kickstart, just in case.
If they try anything funny, blast the crap outta 'em!
Emperor' s blog, dunno what Moondate.
The P- Fleet wiped the floor with these Babel losers.
We' il secure a base here and then go on to conquer their Earth.
The crew' il get some rest, and...... I figure I' il get some, too.
Go get 'em, Tiger!
... Demanding landing clearance.
Clearance granted in Hangar 1.
- Tell me about it.
Hey kid, is your insurance in order?
- Why?
I feel it in my bones, we won' t be coming back.
Nah, it can' t be that bad.
Last time it was supposed to be a cakewalk, my two buddies bought it.
And that Japanese guy Kamikaze, he' s never gonna walk again!
And then there was... - Shut up!
Is everything ready?
What the hell are you smirking at?
Sherrypie is SO going to get it...
Let' s move!
Where' s Sherrypie?
He shot himself in the head, three times.
If you wish to see the body...
- Well I don' t.
But you can show me around the station.
My station.
Where would you like to start, Sir?
How about your bedroom, you know, Sherrypie promised me something...
Yes, Sir.
This is Emperor Pirk.
One- half of all crews can come aboard on leave.
Oh, and nobody disturb me for the next fift... hour!
Right, let' s go.
Let' s get wasted!
Am I your first?
I' ve had lots of women, after all, I am the Emperor... Yeah!
Our scanners should now be correctly calibrated to this dimension.
I' m picking up energy readings from beyond the hopgate.
I shall make some adjustments...
Wait a minute... what' s that?
- Nothing, just a screen saver.
Sir, Sir!
Goddammit, it' s a trap!
- Very perceptive of you.
The Excavator has arrived with our reinforcements.
Evening, commander.
- Festerbester...
We were taking this new flagship for a spin, and decided to lend a hand.
Where' s Captain Giddyup?
He was feeling unwell, and had to leave the ship under my command.
I never thought I' d say this, but it' s good to see you.
Let' s kick those bastards out of this galaxy!
This is Captain Jonny K. Sherrypie.
The rumors of my death are greatly exaggerated.
Aww, crap.
Starting immediately, we' re retaking our station from these oppressors.
Defend that which is ours by right!
Brown sector!
On the double!
To the Zicala!
All P- Fleet personnel are under arrest under Earth martial law.
They are not to be allowed to leave the station.
I promise a fair court- martial and a swift execution.
There is a ship, registration ZEX- 51 4, parked aft of the station - in a handicap space.
Will the owner move it A. S. A. P.
Activate the defense grid and open fire!
The dishonorable traitors!
I told them it' s a trap!
Me kill you!
Control yourself, apeman. The Emperor and half our crews are still aboard.
At least we' il destroy their ships.
Kickstart to fleet, aim light balls!
I believe I was placed in command.
Aim light balls on attacking enemy ships and fire on my mark.
Fleet reporting: practically all light balls expended.
In that case, approach to twinkler range at full shove power.
Our losses should not exceed 68. 4 per cent.
I guess it' s a passable day to die.
Blast it, I' il handle this!
Lt Fubar!
Don' t go!
- It is my destiny.
People get killed, you know.
Order your men to lay down their arms.
I guarantee a fair court- martial to all those who surrender.
And, I lost my communicator.
Ivanovitsa, inform the enemy fleet that we' ve captured their Emperor.
Cannot comply, Sir. That last hit disabled our communications systems.
Darn.
I' m no use to you anymore.
How about I' il just scoot off?
Weapons range attained!
When I joined the military, I swore to protect Earth against any enemy.
I have faced starving Martian insurgents and the fleets of Minibar.
All this I have done to protect the unified Earth, unified mankind...
Bastard!
Very well, if you can' t wait to die.
Emperor Pirk, I sentence you to death for your crimes against humanity.
You will be executed immediately, by five plasma pellets to the head.
Go ahead with your speech!
Ready... aim...
Zounds!
Why weren' t those ceiling struts fastened properly?
Zucker?
You shall be avenged!
All worked up over some security guy who died...
Run, boys!
I' il cover you!
Let' s roast them!
My sled...
Going somewhere, Emperor?
Blast these struts!
This station is a piece of crap!
No turbolift, nothing!
You can use the exercise!
Why exercise when you can get one of these delivered to your home?
Stop hiding, you!
Now what' s with this thing?
Oh Jefferson! The batteries are out!
Let' s settle this like men - one on one.
Get up!
This is for Zucker!
So, Emperor. The game' s over.
Understand this, Pirk.
You and me, as soldiers, know this better than anyone.
But when you murdered my friend in cold blood, this became personal.
I' il see to it that you die slowly, and have time to regret everything.
Didn' t anyone ever tell you your bootlaces are too long?
My contact lenses!
- Found 'em!
Security guards to the hangar!
Enemy target destroyed.
Moving on to next...
Imperial Distress Call
Pirk to...
Sir, we do hear you.
Come and get me ASAP. Them cowards set me up!
You don' t say, Sir.
- They were no match for my cunning.
Get over here and rescue me!
Set a course for the Emperor' s sled.
- I' il just destroy this destroyer.
Commander, it' s an Imperial Distress Call.
One second!
We obey a superior officer.
I' ve had it with you, binary brains!
Whatever you may think, the VCR remote stop button doesn' t harm me.
Now, perhaps we can go and help out the Emperor.
Hayday to fleet.
Are your crews back from R& R yet?
Curses!
I want the heavy destroyers taken out now!
Oh Thursday!
Yeehaw!
- All clear, Sir!
What kept you guys?
They almost got me!
We came as soon as we could, limited by the performance of Cmdr Dwarf.
Wars aren' t won by avoiding battles.
Status report!
We have lost 23 ships, and have 14 operational ships left.
Enemy reinforcements are putting up a stiff fight.
Additionally, our twinkle beams are powerless against their flagship.
What the hell... are we armed with twinklers or flashlights?
Light balls seem to work better, but the Kickstart only has nine left.
I know: let' s fire 'em all at once.
And Dwarf, this is an important shot so I' m taking over.
Sir, I really wouldn' t recommend it.
Maybe the range is too much for you, but for me it' s a piece of pie.
Computer, manual override of weapon systems.
This is child' s play.
Goddammit.
Dork.
I had it in my sights, didn' t I?!
Sir, have you ever heard of leading the target?
Lead?
Can' t these damn computers calculate it for me?
When the target' s in the crosshairs, the shots should hit!
Child' s play, indeed!
You couldn' t have hit it yourself.
You rotten... Take a shower, stinker!
Plingon warriors do not take showers!
Sir, a hit from that attack would have caused serious damage.
The enemy command ship may be a grave threat.
Ready the main gun...
Heavy structural damage to starboard!
- Shut up and keep firing!
Their main gun is locking on us.
- Well take evasionic action then.
Evasionic action Pirk- 7.
Retreat, fast!
Power will be back in 40 seconds.
I' d like to know what whoever designed this weapon was thinking.
I estimate that the enemy flagship can fire again in 1 7. 3 seconds.
Hey, let' s hide behind the station.
They won' t dare shoot at us there.
Finally.
And where is our friend the Kickstart?
Unknown, Sir. The blackout caused the targeting computer to reboot, - so we lost lock- on.
But I' il track them down again in no time.
Captain' s blog: The Kalinka suffered heavy damage to halludeck circuits, - and we retreated for repairs.
Most of the crew were on the halludeck - having a vodka party, and now the door seems to be stuck.
Lt. Makarov, how are the repairs?
No hurry.
Looks like the battle will go on for some time.
This is cold.
Ouch!
Holy shit.
According to our scanners, the Kalinka still has 20 light balls.
That Russkie coward been holding back again?
If we ask Capt Fukov to deliver his light balls to us, we can close in...
And blast them to pieces!
Only I might do the targeting this time.
Like hell you will! This is my show.
Esteemed Emperor, it seems you tore off your joy stick on that last try.
OK. You shoot, but you' d better hit.
Open a channel to Fukov!
Hi there.
What' ve you done?
Not one hit, but your ship is in pieces.
We had some technical problems.
... bring them to the Kickstart.
- Come again?
Send the whole case.
And pack them well or they' il warm up in transit.
Hokay...
The enemy is pressing on our fleet.
Should we withdraw to regroup?
Have you located the Kickstart yet?
Yes, Sir.
It' s sitting next to the Babel- 13.
But our ships...... are able to look after themselves.
We shall destroy the Kickstart.
I sense these spineless worms only fight for fear of their Emperor.
The loss of their flagship will crush their spirit and secure our victory.
The light ball loader is calling.
Sir, the shipment from the Kalinka just arrived from the sled bay.
High time, too.
- What am I supposed to do with it?
What do you think, pea brain?
Stuff 'em in the light ball tubes!
"This is the light ball loader, what do I do with light balls?
Hide 'em under my bed? "
That' s the last time I ever recruit my crew from Russia.
Ready to execute the plan, Sir.
Get us into a firing position.
Sir, the Kickstart left the side of the Babel 13 and is heading at us.
This is Emperor Pirk!
Any last words before we blast you to bits?
Ah, the Emperor. We meet at last.
I regret to say your pitiful attempt only makes me feel sorry for you.
We' il see who' s sorry after 20 light balls!
Prepare the twist drive.
They are making this too easy... but never look a gift horse in the mouth.
Prepare the main gun...
Now!
Pirk' s cunning strikes again.
Lightballs locked onto their bridge.
Fire!
The Corps is Momma and Granny.
Direct hits on bridge!... With light balls loaded with 1 2- oz. beer bottles.
Fukooooov!
- What?
What... was... your big idea... with these light balls?
Light balls?
What light balls?
I told you to send over your light balls you braindead Commie mutant!
No, you asked for "light beer".
Enemy ship returning fire.
- Get outta the way!
Too late.
Massive damage taken!
- One twist drive destroyed!
Lost connections for twinkle banks
Computer helpdesk went bankrupt!
- Halludeck going offline!
Coffee- o- Matic damaged beyond repair!
Ne' er mind that, she' s gaun tae blow!
The twist core just breuk an thare' s antimaterial gas awgates.
Return fire!
- Weapon systems are inoperable.
Furthermore, our twist core will split in 3. 6 minutes.
At least we' il take the bastard with us!
How pathetic.
Our next shot will take them out.
Captain!... Ready the main gun...
Sir, somehow the beer seems to have corroded all control circuits.
The main gun is out of action.
Fine then. We' il do it the hard way.
Secondary guns, fire!
Gimme all you got! You can' t hurt me!
You are a good sport, but as you can see, you are finished.
Well I have the last laugh.
And it' s on you and your silly leather gloves.
Arrogant insect.
We have the mass advantage!
Okay, Fukov.
Disengage the sucking beam, and break to the right.
Sure, Sir!
Emperor, there' s a slight problem...
- You stupid moron!
26 seconds to impact.
- Fukooov!
Waitaminit!
What' s this?
It' s... it' s the spare stick!
- Spare stick?
2. 1 seconds to impact!
See you in Reykjavik!
Oh, crap.
The situation looks bad, Sir.
The fleet is decimated and the enemy is setting up to attack the station.
Erm, I take it that the defense grid has been activated?
It would be, if there was anything left of it.
Hi guys, how' s it hangin '?
- No.
I' m absolutely wasted!
- So you fell off the wagon again.
They don' t call me Garybrandy for nothin '.
We' il soon all be dead, anyway.
There must be something we can do.
We can take them bastards with us.
The fusion reactor' s warming up nicely.
What?
I disconnected the cooling system.
The fireworks should start in about
Reconnect the system immediately!
Wait!
Mike may be right. What other options do we have?
We will fight till the last!
- We have nothing left to fight with!
No! We have men, PPB' s, our fists!
When they come to take the station..
My guess is that after the last time, Pirk won' t try to TAKE the station.
So all we gotta do is keep 'em close for a little while longer.
Jonny, you need to relax a bit.
Wanna drink?
Effin 'traitors. You are SO toast.
Babel 1 3 surrenders unconditionally.
- Dwarf, warm up the twinkle banks.
But don' t you think it' d be better to shoot from a closer range?
Beams traveling across all that space would waste a lot of energy.
Good idea! Tell the fleet to move to point blank range and lock on.
It seems the station' s power plant is approaching critical mass.
What?
They' re trying to pull a fast one again!
Who would' ve thought.
Gimme full twist!
It' s not working!
Sir, we' re losing antimaterial gas, and can only use half shove power.
All power to shove engines!
Oh, and inform the rest of the fleet.
Hello, Carlo' s Sex Line.
We need to hurry, things are so hot.
- Sounds exciting, what do I do?
The Emperor says to pull out before it pops!
Fukov, what' s taking so long?
Did you inform the fleet or what?
Yeah, Captain Carlo answered.
Critical mass in 38 seconds.
- Into the jello hole, and fast!
Our fearless leader is running away.
All ships, follow the Emperor.
We made it!
Garybrandy, shut down the reactor immediately!
I' m almost there!
Oh peanuts!
Where the hell is the rest of my fleet?
Fukov, didn' t you reach them?
Hurry up!
Great job.
- You can' t win every time, Sir.
And who asked you?
Info, where the hell are we, anyway?
One moment.
I' m recalibrating our scanners for our dimension.
What the hell?
This end of the maggot hole must have shifted in time- space.
Avoid that planet!
Insufficient energy for shove power.
Beam us onto the planet!
There' s only enough energy to transfer three people.
Info, Dwarf, get ready to beam down!
It' il be all right.
OK, Info.
How about letting us know where the hell we are?
Hawaii, on Earth.
So where are all the surfers and hula hula dancers, smart guy?
Some 1 1, 000 years in the future.
- What?
I assume the maggot hole put us on Earth, during the Ice Age.
The Ice Age?
Now what' re we gonna do?
How about shooting ourselves before the twinklers freeze?
In a low- power mode, I believe I can make it until the 21st century, - and prevent the fateful invasion campaign from taking place.
So that none of this ever happened?
Then I' il be saved!
In a way. Yes.
Take him out.
Nasty shit becomes routine when you live like a gangster.
You think you' re prepared for everything.
Until the day you' re ordered to kill your best friend.
My dad knew every Pakistani in Oslo, and they all knew him.
It always took forever to walk down the street.
- And he always had to haggle.
Welcome.
l hated that.
What are you looking at, boys?
Ask how much they are.
- How much are these?
- 398 kroner.
Levi' s.
398 kroner, dad.
I heard him.
Ask how much these are.
- Those are girls' pants.
- Ask how much they are.
- How much are these?
- They were in the discount basket.
They are 49 kroner per pair.
Nice quality, but not exactly your style.
I know.
In Pakistan they cost ten rupees.
That' s five kroner.
Tell him 100 kroner for all four.
Can we buy all four pairs for 100 kroner?
They are 49 kroner each.
They are already on sale.
I' ve never heard a Pakistani haggle so poorly!
We' il take these.
Damn kids grow so fast.
100 kroner?
No, as I told your son...
My son doesn' t understand anything!
125 kroner.
You' re expensive.
They are already on sale!
196 kroner.
Come, boys!
150 kroner.
My final offer.
Hey, garlic!
- Where do you think you' re going?
- Inside.
- You can' t get in.
- Why not?
Because you stink.
I was 13 that fall.
I lived in one of the safest, most boring cities in the world.
But my life was far from boring.
The three of us were inseparable.
Munawar was always looking for action and always in a good mood.
Riaz was my neighbor.
We were like brothers.
l was the smallest.
Not the youngest, but the smallest.
Being small has its advantages.
Everyone thinks you' re innocent.
Levi' s.
This is excellent.
We watched Bollywood films, and dreamt of being like those heroes.
We weren' t going to end up losers.
A bus driver was the last thing we wanted to be.
All Pakis in Norway were losers, with a few exceptions.
47, 48, 49, 50!
Get up!
OK, now a combination.
Come on, you and me.
A bouncer, or whatever.
What?
What have we done to you?
Step back, and... bang!
His eardrum is popped, OK?
You meet some guy...
OK, pay attention.
Up there!
Saddiq was the most dangerous person we knew of.
The gang was called East Side Crew.
You didn' t mess with them.
Come on!
Good!
Punks!
What are you doing here?
Are you spying?
- What did you see?
- Nothing.
Spies get punished, right?
One for each of us.
Try the first combination.
Remember the elbow.
- Don' t!
- Shut up!
Wait!
I found a boxcar full of Levi' s.
- Like the ones we' re wearing.
- Where?
- Right over here.
- Where?
Show me.
If you' re lying, I' il beat the shit out of you.
And you.
Where are they?
They' re...
What do we get for showing you?
He has attitude!
I like that.
You got a big mouth, huh?
Just show me.
- What are your names?
- Wasim.
- Munawar.
- Riaz.
I have a job for you.
If you dare.
What kind of a job?
Come on, guys!
"... and his disciples rebuked those that brought them."
"But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them..."
Thank you, Eva.
Wasim?
Can you read for us?
Page 107.
Start from "... said unto them."
At the top of the page.
- for of such is the kingdom of God. "
What do you think he meant by that?
Who?
Jesus.
How should I know?
This is the third time you haven' t paid attention.
- Please leave.
- Leave?
Where?
- Out in the hall.
- What the fuck?
- What kind of language is that?
- Fuck, I haven' t done anything!
What is the matter with you?
You simply can' t behave like that here.
The Norwegian school is based on respect.
Respect for yourself.
Everyone has to respect each other.
For Riaz.
Here.
Munawar.
Come on.
And Wasim.
You are expelled for one week.
And your parents must sign this letter.
Wasim, what is this?
I had a school project and got the highest grade.
The highest grade again!
You can sign your name here.
Mom didn' t say anything.
She didn' t understand Norwegian.
Pops worked as a night watchman and had a cleaning job.
When he was home, all he wanted to do was sleep.
Wasim, go make tea for your father.
I don' t want tea.
I' m going to sleep for an hour, then back to work.
- Where are you going now, Wasim?
- I have practice.
OK.
- Who is it?
- ls Riaz home?
- Yes.
Would you like to eat with us?
- We have to hurry.
- Riaz, have you eaten?
Hey, the boys showed up!
Let' s get going.
- Hi, Bullet.
- Hey there.
Everything OK?
Come on.
Hey, hold on!
- What' s the matter?
- What' s this?
What the hell do you mean?
That' s 250.
- 350, 000.
- Give me a break!
You didn' t mention the alarm.
That costs more.
Carry everything back!
What' s this?
An alarm?
I' d like to know about things like that.
320.
That' s all I' ve got.
320, 000.
You think this is a flea market?
Forget about it.
OK!
Fine.
Go fuck your sister!
What was that?
What was that?
I just said you were a good business partner.
You can save that monkey language for the jungle.
We stick to city talk here.
Go ahead, boys!
Here.
Keep your mouths shut, and we might give you more jobs.
Wasim, what are you doing home?
No school today.
Planning day.
Who was that at the door?
No one.
Goddamn kids!
They have no respect.
If I get my hands on them, I' il wring their necks!
Haven' t you learned...
I thought it was those bastards... children that...
Are you Wasim Khan' s father?
I' m his principal.
Is Wasim home?
Yes, he is home.
Wasim!
Why haven' t you been to school for three weeks?
Three weeks?
You disobedient, stupid brat!!
Why don' t you read and memorize?
You little brat!
Get out there and read!
Dad sent me to Pakistan to study the Koran.
So I would become more respectful.
Pakistan was like a different planet.
What was I supposed to do there?
You have to go to school!
Wasim, where are you?
I know you' re hiding.
You' re just doing this to irritate me.
I won' t give up until I find you!
I lived with an aunt I didn' t know.
She nagged all the time, just like everyone back in Norway.
Dad left me alone there for two years.
In the village he himself had left.
Everyone was foreign to me.
I had no one to talk to.
When I was 15 I came home again.
Almost everything had changed.
Dad had bought a snack bar and we had moved to Stovner.
A goddam boring place, far from the city.
Hello?
Hello?
- Who was that, honey?
- No one, mother.
- Wasim, where are you going?
- I' m just going out.
He' s here!
Come on.
East Side Crew hadn' t become any smaller.
The major newspapers had yet to realize there were any Paki gangs.
And the politicians wouldn' t understand anything for years.
Good to see you!
East Side Crew had become renowned in the '90s.
And we three buddies had stuck together.
And me.
We three were the super- sellers.
We handled everything that could be bought and sold in Oslo' s underworld.
- beat up, threatened or whacked anyone who got in our way.
Farooq was the worst.
Saddiq trusted him 100%.
Saddiq, and his big brother Khalid.
They came to an uncle in Norway as kids.
Refused to let them go to school.
One day the uncle disappeared.
Everyone suspected them.
But no body was ever found.
Their goal was to take over Oslo.
The only one in their way was the Bullet.
Hey, guys, feel free to come and play whenever you want.
Isn' t it nice here?
Best place in town.
Hey, we aren' t here to play.
Come on, boys.
Bullet, I want to buy.
1 500 for a fiver.
1 000.
Saddiq, lots of guys want your job.
We had an ongoing business with the Bullet, buying and reselling smack.
But Saddiq felt we could be bigger.
So we started importing our own.
We had monthly mules from Pakistan.
Via Copenhagen, Stockholm, Amsterdam.
We had a lot of smack, but no trouble getting rid of it.
Our biggest client was the Swede.
A failed rocker who dealt drugs to other failed rockers.
He was the Bullet' s client, but we didn' t give a shit.
Hey, Wasim.
Hey.
You' re late.
You want my business to go to hell?
Something to drink?
Whiskey?
Vodka?
I have Corona.
"Straight from Mexico, hombre!"
Everything OK?
We always kept the cash one place, the stash somewhere else.
- Yeah?
- You can order the food.
Get caught with cash and drugs in the same place, and you' re fucked.
Harry was the Swede' s drug tester.
He was awesome.
- and most likely who smuggled it in.
We have a deal.
You' ve got 14 days to pay the rest.
1, 530, 000 in cash.
Monday the 25th at 12 noon.
Sharp.
This is as good as sold.
I need more by the end of the week.
- The same amount?
- If that' s all you can get.
Or should I go back to the Bullet?
Pay us within a week, and we' il get you more.
- Deal?
- Deal.
Respect.
Respect, man!
Something had to happen.
But Saddiq understood that would be bad business.
- we took over the rest of Oslo.
Times were good.
We made more than we could spend.
All those other Pakis were losers.
They never got any respect, while we took the respect we deserved.
We were kings on the town.
- that manages to get home at five a. m.!
- Give me your key!
- What?
Shut up and get out!
I know what you' re up to.
You' re no longer welcome here.
You think that makes me sad?
That I like living here?
You think I live here for my own sake?
Imagine what people will say!
- and live with their wives and children in this home, with us.
- Everything OK?
- Sure.
Khalid and Saddiq started a café as a cover.
It was a hole in the wall, -
- but not many places in Oslo had that kind of turnover.
Go get a van in Bjørkelangen.
I have a date with Nina.
I have plans.
I can' t do this.
You what?
He' il do it.
- We have to be two.
- Then let' s go right now!
Riaz had started to change.
Didn' t respect the leaders.
Put himself above others.
Hurry!
I have to be back by nine.
- Not a chance.
- Maybe if you speed up.
I' m tired of being an errand boy for him!
Come on!
You' re always so slow!
Don' t make a scene.
Fucking Khalid!
He still treats us like punks.
It turned out Khalid was doing Riaz 'girlfriend whenever he sent us out.
That always leads to trouble.
- Wasim, I' m leaving.
- Wish her a happy birthday from me.
Khalid got caught the morning after we picked up that van.
They found heroin in his car.
That isn' t mine, I' m telling you!
The same heroin only Riaz and I knew about.
Saddiq and Khalid weren' t Norwegian citizens.
Khalid was deported to Pakistan.
The worst thing that could happen.
It took several months to find Riaz, but Saddiq refused to give up.
Khalid was Saddiq' s only family, and he swore revenge.
I don' t know how Riaz thought he could get away.
- No one here.
- Not here either.
Where is Riaz?
Where is Riaz?!
Where the fuck is Riaz?!
If you tell me where he is...
I' il let you live...
A normal life.
Lisa?
Wasim!
Come here.
Check his breathing.
Check his breathing!
He' s alive.
Good.
Take him out.
- Take him out?
You.
Are you fucking deaf, or what?
Why me?
All the drugs disappeared when Riaz snitched.
We needed new mules.
But there was always some desperate Paki in need of cash.
Wasim?
- Wasim?
I' m coming.
- Do you have a paper towel?
- Yes, sir.
- Wasim.
- OK, Babar.
You go to Pakistan on Saturday.
You get two days to visit family.
Then you stay in our house in Lahore the rest of the week.
You get 100, 000 cash for the job.
On delivery.
But I need the money now.
The bank is going to take my store.
You have to help me!
Farooq?
You get half now, the rest on delivery.
Minus 10% for this loan.
Thank you, brother.
Praise God!
- we' il find out everything you tell the police.
Wasim.
I guarantee you' re a dead man if you rat on us.
Even if you' re in solitary confinement.
If the heroin or you disappear, we' il find you.
Guaranteed.
Hey!
Do you have a video camera?
The insurance company told me I had to!
You know I can' t be filmed!
Is this the only copy?
Your life isn' t worth much!
You understand?
You understand?!
Answer me, dammit!
Wasim...
Wasim.
Farooq, give me five minutes.
I' m unsure about him.
He imports fruit.
He often takes trips to Pakistan.
Customs has checked him.
They know who he is.
OK.
You haven' t done anything wrong.
What about this?
Burn it.
My little brother, Amir, also had problems staying out of trouble.
- Boss...
- What is it?
He wants another 50, 000 credit.
Amir felt sorry for himself because he was so fat.
It didn' t help that he worked with pops at the snack bar.
- and pretty soon you look like Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan.
What did you say?
Could you repeat that?
Could you say that again?
- I didn' t know I owed that much.
- Didn' t know you owed that much?!
You' ve been gambling for three days straight, losing the entire time!
You owe me 150, 000!
I' m not paying you anything.
I didn' t hear you.
You' re cheating.
That lady clearly cheated.
Me, cheat?
You don' t understand how serious this is.
What' s the stress?
Tonight is Renate' s last night.
Get in the car.
It' s Amir.
Hurry up!
Come on!
- Are you gambling again?
- Listen to Mr. Perfect.
At least I can take care of myself.
Look at you.
- Who was it?
- No one.
I said, who!
I' m telling you, no one.
- It was the Bullet.
- The Bullet?!
Shit!
I don' t fucking get it.
Why Australia?
Could you please shut up about Renate for one second?
I don' t mind her going to school.
That' s fine.
But the other side of the world?
She wants to get away!
Concentrate.
Relax.
I' ve been concentrating all night.
There he is.
This is not a good idea.
Where the hell is he?
Dammit!
So goddam slow...
Don' t move!
Don' t move!
Easy, Wasim.
Can' t we talk?
- Shut up.
- We can fix this.
- Shut up!
On your knees.
- We can agree on a price.
- Shut up!
On your knees.
- Give me a price.
Anything.
- This isn' t right.
- You die now.
- What did you do to my brother?
- Take it easy...
Be reasonable.
You can' t live with this!
- What are you doing here?
- What' s this, Saddiq?
- What' s going on?
- The prick beat up my brother.
Take it easy.
- Put your gun away.
- Does that mean I can get up?
Of course.
- Wasim...
- What are you doing here?
- Relax.
- What are you doing here?
Come with us.
Babar got caught with the drugs.
Our supplies have dried up.
He wasn' t a pro.
That was unfortunate, for him and for us.
We had to make a deal with the Bullet.
He helps us deliver now, we help him later.
- You could have said something.
- Munawar?
We need a new courier.
You have to go to Pakistan.
Why him?
You think the customs agents are that stupid?
- When?
- On Saturday.
- Bring the money down?
The drugs up.
We' il send the money with someone else.
This is business, Wasim.
Get your brother to stop gambling, instead of going after the Bullet.
I don' t want any trouble with the Bullet!
- Don' t get out.
- I' il go with you.
They' il be onto us, if they see us together.
- Give them my best.
- Who?
Everyone.
All of Pakistan.
Shit, I haven' t been there since I was 15.
You looked like a real hick when you came home.
Take care.
- Don' t look the agents in the eye.
- I' m not going to Pakistan.
This is no life.
- I' m going with Renate to Australia.
- Why tell me?
Couldn' t you just have left?
What are you going to do about it?
Shoot me, too?
Just get out of here!
Tell them whatever you want.
I don' t give a shit.
- Take it easy.
- I am taking it easy.
Wasim, my boy, drive a little slower.
Uncle and auntie want you to visit.
You come with us next time.
Right, mom?
Hey, Wasim.
Come in.
Are you hungry?
Munawar never showed up.
The money made it, but no mule.
Are you kidding?
What could have happened?
- Me?
He never left.
So he' s hiding.
But where?
- Where?
- How would I know?
Wasim, your friends have become a problem for us.
But if you tell me where he is, I' il let him live.
I have no idea.
He didn' t say anything.
Wasim, Wasim...
Don' t let your emotions get the upper hand.
Even though your friends have let us down...
I' m counting on you.
But I need to know if I can trust you.
Can I?
Here.
- Did you rob a bank?
- I' m leaving town for a week or so.
I want you to pay an installment to the Bullet.
I can' t protect you anymore, but I' il get the rest of the money.
I' il be back in a week.
Hang in there until then.
What are you doing here?
I' ve paid you.
One installment.
How' s business?
- Not good.
- What do you have in the till?
Today wasn' t a very good day.
We' il be back every single day until you' ve paid off your debt.
Don' t eat or drink until you get the bags out of your stomach.
Stewardesses are trained to look for passengers that don' t eat.
Don' t let them notice that you don' t eat or drink.
You have 24 hours.
After 24 hours the bags will break.
If they break, you' re dead.
As soon as you get back, take a laxative and get them out.
I knew it.
I was bound to get caught.
And I had no one to blame but myself.
Hey, you!
Come over here.
Drive!
Fast!
And stop at a pharmacy.
- I' il give you a discount.
What' s the catch?
- Saddiq can' t find out.
- No way!
- I can' t start a war!
- There won' t be a war.
You' ve bought from freelancers before.
I' il give you a good price.
- How good?
- 3000 per fiver, 100% cash up front.
- 2900, 70 up front.
- 2950, 80% cash.
Deal.
- Respect.
- Remember:
Between me and you.
No problem.
Wasim?
You?
It' s been so long.
This is Riaz 'little brother.
Remember him?
Riaz has been gone a long time, if you' re looking for him.
We don' t know where he is.
- What is this?
- I owed this to Riaz.
If he doesn' t come back soon, you can use it.
That' s what he would want.
Thank you, my dear child.
Come, Aslam, let' s bring this upstairs.
- How much do I owe you now?
- How much?
199, 000.
lncluding interest.
I have a proposal for you.
Give me the snack bar.
Then you can forget about your debt.
Scout' s honor.
Huh?
- Where did you get this money?
- The lottery.
I' m about to close.
Getting rid of the Bullet was easy.
Saddiq was a bigger problem.
Who did the Swede buy his heroin from?
That cheap shit?
It was Wasim, I swear.
I heard it with my own ears.
It was Wasim.
It' s me.
Do it.
- Robina doesn' t want to get married.
- Let' s not talk about that now.
Yes, let' s!
- you can have an opinion.
Don' t I drive you to the mosque every week?
Thank you so much, my son.
Is everyone OK?
Are you trying to get us all killed?
Is anyone hurt?
Dad...
- This is your fault!
- Mine?
Dad!
Dad!
Call for an ambulance!
It' s me.
We have to meet.
Wasim!
Wasim...
Why are we meeting here?
- What is that?
- My life insurance.
You' re on that tape as much as I am.
Want to put us all away?
I know who tried to kill me, Saddiq.
As long as I am alive, no one sees that tape.
But if I die, or get harmed in any way, the cops get the tape.
Do you really think that was the only copy?
Don' t forget the gun you shot Riaz with, with your prints on it.
But I' m a Norwegian citizen, Saddiq.
You aren' t.
You' il be deported.
- over a life sentence as a sheep farmer in Pakistan.
What do you want?
You leave me alone, I leave you alone.
OK.
What is it?
Can you pick her up after a concert?
- Where?
When?
- At Rockefeller.
- It ends at two.
- Two o' clock?
Yes.
I' il pick her up.
- Thank you!
- Can you go?
Thank you so much!
Everything will be OK now.
How' s it going?
- Fine.
I have a job for you.
I know of a place.
You have to come with me.
- Hi, Line.
- Hi, Omar.
How' s it going?
- This is Robina.
- Hi.
I' ve seen you at school.
- What' s up?
- We' re being picked up.
- When?
- At two.
We have plenty of time.
Join us for drinks.
Hi, Bullet.
How' s it going?
Meet some friends.
This is Line.
And this is Robina.
Welcome.
Would you like something to drink?
Get one without alcohol.
- I don' t know...
Hi again.
One with alcohol for Line.
And one without alcohol for you, I presume.
Don' t you feel well?
Come here.
Stand here.
This will be fantastic.
- Give me a kiss.
- Stop it.
Come on, kiss me!
- Hm?
What' s that your saying?
No?
Stop it!
- Are you getting this?
- Oh, yes.
- How was she?
- OK.
Get her out of here.
She' s ruining the mood.
Farooq, I have to drop this tape off.
Are you getting this?
No!
Hey, Wasim!
You think this is the only copy?
Huh?
Where are you going?
Wasim?
I' m going with you.
- Stay here!
- You want to get yourself killed?
He' s clean.
Hi.
Hi there!
Do you have all the copies?
- Where is Robina?
- She' s alive.
You have the copies?
I don' t think so.
You said you had arranged something for the cops.
I' m not willing to take that chance.
At a lawyer' s.
I can' t get it until tomorrow.
Come back tomorrow.
- What about Robina?
Can I have her?
Just hurry up and bring the tape tomorrow.
She can handle another round.
But I wouldn' t wait too long.
I want to see her!
Wasim, you have no say in the matter.
You' re a thief.
Show her to me, or you don' t get the tape.
You shouldn' t have stolen from us.
It' s your own fault.
Wake up!
I' d like to fuck your little sister myself.
And now I' il have the chance, while you' re out getting that tape.
How do I know she isn' t dead?
Farooq, get her.
Let' s see if you recognize your little sister.
Wasim...
- Get up!
- Wasim, easy now.
- Let' s work something out.
- Farooq!
Farooq, why didn' t you search him?
Bullet!
Farooq!
Stop!
Where are you going?
I have a sister too.
Fucking traitor!
- You' il never get away with this!
But neither will you.
Want more?
A little shit like you can never be king!
- Stand back!
Police!
- Calm down!
Freeze!
Police!
Don' t move!
Drop your weapon!
Drop your weapon!
Drop it!
Step over there!
- Don' t move!
- Over to the wall!
No!
- Drop your weapon, dammit!
- Drop your weapon!
Drop it!
Elin Hansen.
This is quite simple.
I ask you some questions.
Then we discuss the questions I have asked.
Then what?
I write an evaluation based on my perception of you.
But in the end, the prison board determines if you can be paroled.
Ready?
Yes.
Start by stating your name and age.
Age 36.
I' d like to ask you about your father.
My dad knew every Pakistani in Oslo, and they all knew him.
It always took forever to walk down the street.
And he always had to haggle.
I hated that.
Since time began... a war has been waged in the shadows... between the armies of Good and Evil.
It may be fought on a grand scale... or within the heart of a single individual... or even a child.
The Evil has taken many forms... and used the darkest of arts.
In our time, they call themselves simply... the Hand.
The Good follow the way ofkimagure.
Its masters can see the future... and perhaps even bring back the dead.
Legend tells of a unique warrior... a lost soul.
This warrior is a woman... a motherless daughter.
And it is her destiny to tip the balance between Good and Evil.
She is a treasure, and both sides seek her out... as a final weapon in an ancient war.
- Perimeter, what' s your status?
- Delta team, clear.
- Alpha, clear.
- Bravo, secure.
It doesn' t matter.
You can' t stop her.
- Nobody can stop her.
- Her?
I was afraid if I told you, you wouldn' t take the job.
I never should' ve hired you.
Who do you think' s coming for you?
You may have heard of her.
Her name... is Elektra.
- You find that funny?
- She' s an urban legend, sir.
That woman died years ago.
Really?
Well, then somebody must have brought her back from the dead.
You know, Bauer, when you' ve done the things I' ve done... you make a lot of enemies.
My private security detail... the best money could buy.
This nonexistent woman killed 14 of them in half an hour.
I barely got away.
Spent the next two days in Monte Carlo wondering why she let me go.
Then she came for me.
I was under the protection of the Hand itself, who sent their best.
Although they seemed more interested in killing Elektra than in protecting me.
She cut 'em down like wheat.
Took maybe 10, 15 minutes max.
Didn' t really think why I kept gettin 'away.
So here I am.
And now I understand her.
She wanted me to feel this... what it' s like to have nowhere to go... nowhere to turn.
How' s your perimeter doing now?
Delta, what' s your status?
There' s no signal.
Son of a bitch.
- Alpha, Bravo, report! the closer they can get to you before you know they' re there.
Report!
Ah, Christ.
They say Elektra whispers in your ear before she kills you.
Report.!
- It' s too late for your boss, Bauer.
- But you still have a chance.
- Jesus Christ!
You can' t fight a ghost, Bauer.
Here we are at last.
Guess it' s all true.
The red outfit and the knives and...
So, what happens now?
You just kill me, straight out?
Just cold?
Yeah?
How do you know?
I died once.
So am I to understand that with all the power of the Hand... that the Treasure continues to elude us?
Perhaps if we had pursued it sooner... and more aggressively...
You dare to blame Master Roshi?
Seems our methods are too mild for Kirigi.
But if we cannot have the weapon ourselves... allow me to make sure it does not fall into the hands of those who may use it against us.
Master, allow me.
Things like this must be handled smoothly, quietly.
Then work smoothly, Meizumi, but quickly.
Kirigi?
Yes, Father.
Patience.
You think that' s safe, leaving the door unlocked like that?
Geez, Elektra, you' re gonna end up with a bullet in your head.
I brought you a little something.
Don' t put it down.
I already cleaned there.
- Why do you always do this?
- Get rid of my D. N. A.
Ah, D. N. A., of course.
Right.
Listen, I just picked this up.
I know you like to look.
- It' s all there?
- Less my 10%.
- Half to Barbados?
You can do better in mutual funds.
I could put you in touch...
- No, thanks.
But...
Look, I don' t want to tell you how to do your thing... but quite a body count on this one, E.
Was it necessary?
Had to be done.
Did it?
Elektra.
Did it?
Okay.
Anyway, it spreads the legend.
Besides, they were gonna kill me.
Absolutely.
- but that last job...
I need a breather.
I' m just sayin 'it' s a lot of coin.
- I' m tired.
'cause you are gonna crash, baby, you know that.
I mean, you even get laid?
It' s a lot of money, this new offer.
- McCabe.
Look, you want to take time off, take time off.
Call me when you wanna work.
How much?
And just tell me.
Two.
Ah, they' il give it to somebody else.
They wouldn' t pay that to somebody else.
You got that right.
They asked specifically for you.
Location' s in there.
I' il call you when I get the target.
Get some sleep.
You might wanna reflect a bit.
- Again!
- Clear!
Do you know the way, Elektra?
Kimagure, the ability to control time... the future... even life and death.
I know I' m the best student here.
The most powerful.
You understand violence and pain.
But you do not know the way.
- Teach me then.
- That' s my point.
I can' t teach you.
I want you to go.
No, not a test.
Just go.
I don' t have anywhere to go.
The client says he needs you there a couple days early... says that' s part of the deal.
- Why?
- No idea.
- He just wants you to wait.
- I just want to get this over with.
Hey, me too.
Listen, why don' t you tell me about the view?
I hear it' s gorgeous out there.
You know, you got the...
One, two, three, four, five.
Keep pedaling.
Five more minutes.
Don' t use your hands.
Don' t be lazy.
Let' s go!
Let' s push, push, push, push!
Honey, please.
She' s just a kid.
Keep going, Elektra.
Keep going.
Jesus!
What' s the matter with you?
You could have killed me!
What are you doing here?
Nothing.
I' m friends with the Wheelwrights.
You cut my friggin' jacket.
- The front door was unlocked.
- No, it wasn' t.
- Yeah, it was.
Look, the people who live here let me come in all the time.
Ask anybody.
It' s broken.
- So, who are you anyways?
My name' s Abby.
- What' d you steal?
What do you think I am?
Please don' t call the cops.
My dad will kill me.
In some parts of the world, they just cut your hands off.
How did you do that?
Get out of here.
Mom?
Oh, shit.
You know I can' t sit still, McCabe.
Call me with the name.
Client says he needs you there a couple days early.
Wants you to wait.
- To have nowhere to go...
- Death' s not that bad. - nowhere to turn.
- He wants you to wait.
- You just kill me, straight out?
- He wants you to wait.
Are you looking for me?
Hi.
Are you the new, uh, tenant?
Eddie Ferris, the Realtor... he said, uh, a young woman had taken it for the month.
What do you want?
Sorry.
This is kind of awkward, but, uh... have you seen a girl... 13- year- old, uh, blondish hair to about here?
My daughter, Abby.
- We had a fight yesterday...
- I saw her late afternoon.
- Oh, you did?
- She broke into my house.
Shit.
Really?
Uh, she knows the Wheelwrights, who, uh...
She, uh, didn' t take anything, did she?
- No.
- Good.
I' m happy to pay for it.
I' m Mark Miller.
We' re in the little cabin two houses down.
Okay, thanks.
Hi, you' ve reached McCabe.
But please leave just your name.
- Do not leave a message.
I' m sick of sitting here.
We don' t get a name soon, I' m walking.
Hey.
How long have you been standing there?
Like, a minute.
What did you tell my dad?
Did you tell him I broke into your house?
- Yeah, because you did break in.
- Well, you didn' t have to tell him.
I thought you were cool.
- I' m not.
- Yeah, no kidding.
Now he' s on my case.
He made me come ask you to have Christmas dinner with us.
- Have what?
- Christmas?
Dinner?
December 25?
Did you know today' s Christmas?
I can' t.
I have something to do.
What?
You' re on an island.
Please?
It' s just the two of us every night... and I' m bored out of my skull.
What are you doing?
Why?
- Were you counting?
- No.
Please?
Hmm?
I have to change my clothes.
Great!
I' m Abby.
Elektra.
Cool.
I told you not to leave the house.
- You didn' t even know I was gone.
- Abby.
Chill, Dad.
We have a guest.
She told me that you' d invited me.
I don' t want to...
Uh- uh.
Please, stay.
I' m glad you' re here.
Uh, can I get you a beer?
Wine?
Water.
Her name' s Elektra, Dad.
Elektra.
Like the tragedy.
Your parents must have had a sense of humor.
Not really.
So when she sees all the cute guys who like me... just as friends, Dad... she accidentally spills poster paint all over my model of the Taj Mahal.
So I put glue on her shoes.
I got suspended for that, and then I got expelled for fighting.
But that was way back in the day in... in, um...
Baltimore.
So, I was a little surprised to see you take the Wheelwright place.
Not many renters this time of year.
It' s just for the month, for work.
What do you do anyway?
Oh, layoffs, payroll reduction.
- That sort of thing.
- Sounds boring.
- Abby.
No, it is boring.
I like your bracelet, by the way.
Do you know what those are?
They' re from Indonesia.
Centuries ago, you had to be the best fighter in your village to earn them.
I bought 'em off eBay.
Is there a school here on the island?
Uh, we' re trying homeschooling for a while.
I read at college level.
And I' m doing algebra one on my own.
She' s a good student.
It' s the, uh, behavioral stuff that' s been a problem.
I have authority issues, and I don' t take bullshit well.
- Don' t speak in that...
- Hey, Abby!
It' s okay.
Suddenly I got a teenager on my hands.
- She' s hard on herself.
- You can tell, huh?
- Most people think she' s a slacker.
- No, I shouldn' t.
Merry Christmas?
Where' s her mother?
She died... a couple of years ago.
Back in Baltimore?
Drunk driver.
My mother died when I was young.
- I have work.
- Come on, it' s early.
Thanks for dinner.
What?
You just got a delivery.
- It' s a double.
- Which makes double the money.
Yeah, that' s why the big bucks.
- What' s the matter?
Good.
Then there' il be no problems.
I' il call you when it' s done.
How' s math going?
How do you think it' s going?
What do you mean, you' re not doing it?
Not now or not ever?
- Too many variables.
Not enough background.
- Background?
E, they' il just send somebody else.
The storm we' ve been waiting... all... finally here.
- I' il get sandbags from the shed.
You know, this is such a joke.
They make it sound all exciting, but you know it' s just rain.
If you' re not too busy, young lady, feel free to tape the windows.
Now!
Can I talk to you?
Yeah, sure.
Hey, what' s up?
Can you go to your bedroom for a minute, Abby?
I need to talk to your dad.
Now!
Go, Abby.
- Who are you?
- What?
They won' tjust kill you.
- Dad!
Go!
Run, Abby!
Go!
Go!
- Okay.
- Elektra!
- Abby!
No!
Damn it.
Get back!
Go!
There' il be more coming.
What' s coming next will be worse.
I believe Kirigi wishes to address the Council of the Hand.
Venerable master... despite your delicacy and subtlety... you have failed to solve the problem of the Treasure.
Master Roshi gave that task to me.
- Yes, exactly.
- And my men are taking care of it.
Your men are dead!
Killed by the female, Elektra, the gaijin.
Bu...
Your forces are an abomination!
Master Roshi... the Hand cannot afford to lose the Treasure for another generation.
So I humbly request you allow me this task.
Perhaps with a little less delicacy... my forces will not be defeated by a mere woman.
The task is yours.
Complete it, and you will have proven yourself worthy ofleading this council.
I will step aside.
The Hand.
Of all people.
So who' s gonna help you out on this one, E?
- Stick?
- Just give me his location.
Sure, no problem.
I got it handled.
Goddamn it.
You' re up, blind man.
Double combo: triple carom on the four- three- two- one- six with a bank massé.
Uh, you don' t need to call all your shots, pops.
Just the first one.
That is the first one.
Aw, you gotta be kidding me.
Eight ball in the corner.
- Blind, my ass.
- Leave your money on the table.
Here' s a dollar, Abs.
Go play some pinball.
- Why do I always have to miss the good stuff?
- Just go.
Same walk.
Same perfume.
They need your help.
Over here.
This is Mark Miller.
Mark and his daughter, Abby, are being chased by the Hand... and they need your protection.
I' m leaving them with you.
The Hand is your business, not mine.
Why?
What did you imagine would happen next?
I didn' t really have time to think about it.
Blind instinct.
Then you and I are back where we started, Elektra.
Did you ever ask why the Hand was after them?
- They don' t know.
- Really?
Mr. Miller doesn' t know?
I do know.
The Hand wanted something he couldn' t give.
He tried to run.
And what?
They killed my wife, Abby' s mom.
I lied.
You' re on your own.
Why did you really save them, Elektra?
Some kind of penance?
A down payment on your sins?
Has she told you what she actually does for a living, Mr. Miller?
She saved my life and my daughter' s.
That' s enough for me.
Then you landed on the lucky side of the street.
- Damn, you son of a bitch!
- Because with most people...
Well, Elektra... you haven' t changed.
What are we gonna do?
Elektra?
What are we gonna do?
You gotta run.
As far as you can, as fast as you can.
Africa.
Change your name.
Change your appearance.
- No.
- Why not?
Isn' t that part of your code or something?
I don' t have a code, Abby.
- How are we supposed to defend ourselves?
- We' il be okay, Abby.
No, we won' t.
Wake up, Dad.
We won' t.!
Just like Mom.
Get in the car.
Get in the car!
What' s wrong?
She' s down the street.
Three blocks over in the parking lot.
We need to kill the gaijin assassin first.
Should we go now?
Not here.
Keep track of them.
I' m a soccer mom.
So, you, um... you really kill people for a living?
Yeah.
Why?
It' s what I' m good at.
That' s messed up.
Yeah.
Well, well, the reluctant assassin.
Sorry to drag you into this, McCabe.
Me too.
I' m Abby.
Hello, Abby.
I' m wondering what you' re doing here.
There' s plenty of room in the house.
Go ahead and help yourselves to whatever you need.
- Thank you.
- You' re welcome.
You want to pull the trigger, or should I do it?
Oh, E.
You' re crashin 'on me, baby.
I said you' d crash, and you are crashing.
I just want to get 'em someplace safe, give' em a chance.
They' re already dead, E.
They got no chance.
Don' t go down with them.
I' il need passports.
Sure.
Throw in some season tickets to the Lakers.
Go.
I don' t want you to tell her anything.
I hate lying.
Why can' t we tell her?
- We don' t know anything about her.
- She saved us.
If she knew...
- She' s my friend.
- Your friend?
She' s the only one I have.
- And I do not want to die with...
- You' re not gonna die!
Don' t you ever say that again... ever.
- Okay?
- Yes.
Elektra?
What' s the matter?
Is something wrong?
They told me to change my appearance, so...
No, it' s...
You look great.
Thanks.
Can you show me how to use those things, the, uh, salad tongs?
- Sais.
- Sais.
They' re not for you.
I want to learn how to defend myself.
They' re offensive weapons.
They' re for killing.
You use them.
I don' t want you to be like me.
I do.
Do you wanna learn something really, really difficult?
What?
Come on.
Now sit down.
- Close your eyes.
- What is this, yoga?
- No, it' s called kimagure.
It' s more valuable than learning to use a weapon... because it allows you to see what' s gonna happen before it happens.
- That' s intense.
- Concentrate.
Meditate.
Let go of yourself and see everything around you.
How long did it take you to master?
I never actually finished my training.
I only know enough to keep myself alive.
- Wow.
- Close your eyes and breathe.
Just sit quietly.
How are you doing?
We' re still alive.
Thank you.
Oh, don' t thank me, Mark.
Please, you don' t really know what I was doing.
What you were doing there?
Sure I do.
You were there to kill us.
I knew it as soon as you took the Wheelwright place.
I' m not a good person to get involved with.
I' m not asking for anything.
I' m sorry.
Yeah, I hated that.
E, get back.
Get back now.!
What happened?
That bird' s been hanging around here since late yesterday.
- They' re here.
- Let' s use the truck.
- We won' t make it.
- But that' s the best way.
Trust me.
Use the cellar.
Take you out past the orchard to the trees.
Head north.
What about you?
Shit.
Let' s go.
- Be careful.
- Keep 'em safe.
Don' t tell me, the circus is in town, huh?
I' il tell you what.
You might as well kill me now, 'cause I ain' t talking.
Talking is not necessary.
But I accept the first half of your proposal.
They' re in the woods.
Get Kinkou, head there now.
Hurry.
Hold up.
Just follow me.
Just keep running.
Mark, come on.
Go.
Elektra.
- Elektra!
Go!
Run, Abby!
Run!
Go!
Why didn' t you tell me?
- Elektra.!
- Abby, no!
Let me go!
Ah, you are the little treasure, aren' t you?
The war is over.
Move back, Abby.
She is safe.
Another day, old man.
You' il be fine.
Rest now.
Know where he is.
I' m blind, and I see more than any of you, because I don' t look.
You had no right to drag me into this, Stick.
This whole war with the Hand, everything, it' s all about her, isn' t it?
They call her the Treasure.
She was a prodigy from four or five years old.
Word got around fast.
The Hand wanted her for themselves.
They tried to steal her.
- Her father spirited her away.
- And you set this up... the contract, McCabe, all of this... you hired me to kill them.
You' re entitled to your opinion.
A father and his daughter, Stick.
You manipulated me.
Did I?
Everything from the day you threw me out, has it all been a test?
What if I had failed?
Some lessons can' t be taught, Elektra.
They must be lived to be understood.
When you came here, you were filled with anger.
All the decency you once had, poisoned by violence and tragedy.
This is not the way.
This is not our way.
You talk in riddles, old man.
It keeps my students alert.
I always knew your heart was pure.
You simply needed to see it for yourself.
What about Abby?
As long as Kirigi is alive, she' s only safe here.
She has no choice.
One...
Still breaking and entering I see.
Sorry.
Keep practicing.
I' m sorry I lied to you.
You did what you needed to do.
I didn' t wanna lie to you.
Neither did my dad.
It made me sick not telling you.
Nobody tells the truth about themselves.
Including you.
Especially me.
- The layoffs and payroll reductions.
- Like that.
And the, uh, the counting.
- O. C. D.
I don' t have O. C. D.
I had it when I was a kid, but I haven' t done that in years.
When you walk slow like that.
What are you doing?
Are you counting?
Don' t mock me.
I' m still your superior.
Maybe.
Wanna find out?
I' m gonna go find my dad.
Don' t force it.
You' re forcing it.
You' il be better than I am very soon.
I don' t wanna stay here.
What do you want?
To finish it, you and me.
No help from Stick, no help from your father.
Winner take all.
And when I kill you, the little one is ours.
- Agreed?
- Agreed.
We will meet where it all began.
And it will end where it all began.
For you, at least.
Clever girl.
We meet again.
Now you' il remember.
There' s nothing you can do.
So the balance tips to me.
Let her go.!
Brave girl.
You taught her well.
But it' s time for a new master.
Is that what the blind man' s been teaching you?
But you' il learn to anticipate your opponent.
- I' m not leaving you.
- You' re a pain in the ass.
- Just like you.
One, two, three.
Tattoo, the Treasure' s here.
Stay right behind me.
Stay close, Abby.
Elektra!
I' ve seen it before.
Abby, where are you?
- Elektra?
- Not exactly.
You know, I used to be the Treasure... and I don' t like being replaced.
So let' s keep your death between you and me.
Abby!
Enough.
It ends now.
I told you, there' s nothing you can do.
Come on, let' s go.
Push, push, push.
Let' s push, push, push, push.!
Keep going, Elektra.
Keep going.
I' m just a kid.
I don' t wanna stay here.
Elektra.
Don' t worry, Elektra.
I' il take good care ofher.
Damn it.
Come on.
Abby.
Abby, listen to me.
Listen to me.
I always knew your heart was pure.
You simply needed to see it for yourself.
Hey, warrior girl.
Come here, Abby.
I just found you.
Hi.
Thank you.
Take good care of her.
Sorry.
Yeah, I hated that.
Kirigi' s gone.
No one' s after you.
Back to school?
- And get ice cream.
Oh.
You gave me my life back.
You gave me mine.
Will I see you again?
We' il find each other.
Why not?
You didn' t turn out so bad.
I don' t want it to be so hard for her.
That' s up to her.
Anyway, your second life' s never really like your first, is it?
Sometimes... it' s even better.
Everyone in here is going to (???)
Hang it up, she' s just playing with you
You' re only making it worse
You shut the hell up
Don' t pull the trigger, she blocked the barrell.
It' il backfire
I told you to shut up
Can' t see
I can' t see
I can' t hear anything
For God sake, Miho, finish him
Yeah
Make it quick, will you
She doesn' t quite chop his head off
She makes a Pez Dispenser out of him
Then it' s straight to business stretching the corpses on the alley floor and checking their pockets digging up cash when they find it
I' m fishing around in Jackie Boy' s pants.
His wallet is packed
Master Card, Discover, Platinum American Express
And nearly 300 bucks worth of 20s that I' m not too proud to stuff into my own pockets
Then I find an atom bomb
Jackie Boy.
You son of a bitch
There was a helicopter that kicked up such a racket I couldn' t quite make out what she said
I thought Shellie said "Stop"
She said "Cop"
Detective Lieutenant Jack Rafferty
"Iron Jack", the papers call him
A goddamn hero cop
It' s hell for years, the shaky truce
The cops get a slice of the profits and free entertainment when they throw a party
The girls get to administer their own brand of justice
They get to defend their own turf
They send him packing
But they send him back alive
That' s the rules
That' s the truce
The cops stay out
That keeps the girls free to keep the pimps and the mob out
Old Town will be left wide open
It' il be war
The streets will run red with blood women' s blood
The cops
The mob.
Things are going to go back to the way they used to be
The hell they will
We got guns
We' il fight the cops and the and mob and anybody else who tries to move in on us
We' il go to war
Don' t be stupid, Gail.
You wouldn' t stand a chance
Get me a car
Make sure it' s a hard top with a decent engine
I' il hide the bodies
Did you forget that cop car that trailed them here?
The cops know Rafferty came here
They' il check the river, they' il check the sewer
They' il find him and come gunning for us
I' il hall the bodies to the pits.
The cops won' t check the pits.
Get that gun out of my face or I' il smack you
Who do you think you are, giving orders?
- You got what you wanted out of us - Shut up, Gail
You got what you wanted out of me
And you were gone, off playing with that barmaid.
Gone until you brought this unholy mess on us
Miho moves to my back
1 word from Gail and she' il cut me in half
They' il be watching the roads
They' il catch you
It' il be the bad old days, all over again
The pimps, the beatings, the drugs, the raps
They won' t be watching the roads, not yet, they won' t.
Get me a damn hard top
If I don' t make it, you can have your war
Get that gun out of my face, now
Bastard!
I forgot how quick you are
My warrior woman
She almost yanks my head clean off
Shoving my mouth into hers, it hurts
An explosion that blasts away the dull gray years between the now and that 1 firey night when she was mine
A hard top, with a decent engine, and make sure it' s got a big trunk
I' il always love you, baby
And never
Where' d you find that heap?
Just look at that trunk
- We' il never fit them all in - Gail?
Unless there' s something else you want me to do, do you think maybe I could go home?
All this blood and stuff' s got me feeling like maybe I got to hurl
Sure, Becky, go home.
But don' t you talk to anybody
Not even your mom
They' il never fit in that trunk
Not like this, they won' t
Miho?
Dry your hair as soon as you get home
You' il catch cold if you don' t
Hey, Becky.
Gail said no calls
I just want to hear my mom' s voice.
I won' t tell her nothing
Please, don' t say nothing to Gail
Hey, mama?
Dizzy dames
What were they thinking sticking me up with a bucket of bolts like this?
We were barely able to get the trunk to stay closed as it was, we packed it so tight
There wasn' t anything we could do but pile Jackie Boy in right next to me
Now where anybody who cares to look will see him
Go ahead.
Take 1 of his cigarettes
It' il help
It' s got you smoking there, bud
You shut the hell up, Jackie Boy
You' re dead
I' m just imagining this, so shut the hell up
That tells you something about your state of mind, don' t it
It' s got your nerves shot
It' s got you smoking
You know it' s true...
Nobody ever really quits
A smoker' s a smoker when the chips are down
- And your chips are down... much - I' m fine, you shut the hell up
Will you look at that
Those hookers let you down
What are you going to do when you run out of gas?
Call Triple A?
You sucker for the babes
You ain' t even going to make it to the pits
You shut the hell up.
I' il make it
Not unless you keep your eyes on the road, sugar pie
Watch it!
Ah, this is great.
Just like being in a body movie
Shut up!
Oh, you' re screwed
It' s over.
You' re flushed
This time I can' t bring myself to tell him to shut up
Sure he' s an asshole.
Sure he' s dead
Sure that I' m just imagining that he' s talking
None of that stops the bastard from being absolutely right
I don' t have a chance in hell of outrunning this cop
Not in this heap
Pull over!
The only question left is whether I' m going to kill him or not
Tough call
For all I know, he' s an honest cop, regular guy working stiff with a mortgage, a wife, and a pile of kids
My hand moves on its own, sliding 1 of my guns to my lap and thumbing back the hammer
I don' t know what to do
You better stop.
You' re making him mad
Whatever you say
You' re friend here.
Party a little too hard tonight?
I' m the designated driver
Well, you' re driving with a busted tail light
I' il let you off with a warning
What next?
The tank goes dry a quarter mile from the pits
I shove the T- Bird the rest of the way
A few minutes more work and it' il all be over
Jackie Boy will go into the damn tar pits
I' il catch a train out of Sacred Oaks
Go home and call it a...
No more questions, Dallas.
Clear the streets
We' re on lockdown.
We' re not selling any tail in Old Town
Not tonight
Don' t struggle.
You' il only hurt yourself
Your cause is lost
We know everything
Soon the corpse of Detective Rafferty will be in our possession
And the truce between your prostitutes and the police will be shattered
There' il be deaths
My employer will sieze what remains of this neighborhood
You will all be slaves.
Nothing can stop this
But it is within your power to save many lives by facilitating the process of transition by negotiating the terms of the surrender of Old Town
Son of a bitch.
I knew you...
I have suffered your kind before
The dregs of Sin City.
I serve a new master now
And soon, you and all your retched kind will serve him as well
Now get dressed and shed a tear for Dwight McCarthy if you must because by now, he is surely dead
You don' t know him
My man will find a way
He always finds a way
I find these Americans always whine and going on about how they got it so bad
This is a fine, grand country.
Guiding light of the modern world, it is
Low taxes, land of of opportunity
Where else would 1 bullet boy' s defortune that we' re getting for this (???)
Sure beats a living hell out of blowing off airports and churches without shit to show for it
You find something, Murphy?
Look to be our poor dead cop' s badge
It' s all bent up
Bent and stock in it
Oh, bloody he...
It' s the bullet
You son of a bitch!
Bastard!
They weren' t cops, these 4
They were mercenaries
And if they were hired by who I think they were, the bad times haven' t even started yet
And everything seemed to be going so well
Remember, we don' t have to deliver every last inch of the man, Brian
You got a good point there, Ronnie
Hand me a knife
Should take a nap while I' m doing all this waiting
I' m at the bone, alright?
Have you ever seen anything so pretty in your whole life?
We' re a back to 3 of you.
And if anyone happens by, use your imagination.
OK?
Silence now
No air to breath
Only the horrid oily tar taste creeping up my nostrils
Let it fill your lungs
They were counting on you, and you blew it
Skinny, stealy fingers at my wrist
Miho, you' re an angel.
You' re a saint
You' re Mother Theresa.
You' re Elvis
You' re a god
And if you' ve shown up 10 minutes earlier, we' d still have Jackie Boy' s head
Dwight, they got Gail
It' s a sinch.
You got yourself a spy in Old Town
A stooly who sold you out to the mob
We got to find out who it is and rescue Gail
But first we got to get our hands on Jackie Boy' s head before it gets to wherever it' s going and then this whole situation blows wide open
Miho.
I hope to hell you left 1 of them alive enough to talk
I let him know I' m not fooling around
We talk
Stay smart, stay cool
It' s time to prove to your friends that you' re worth a damn
Sometimes that means dying
Sometimes it means killing a whole lot of people
There they are.
What do we do?
We stop them, Dallas
Jackie Boy' s head so close to me, I could almost reach out and grab it right then and there
Get the head, get the head
I got it, I got it
Suck on this, you stupid slag
I can' t tell if Miho is alive or dead but I' m on my feet and every ounce of me wants to get some killing done
Want the head now, sweetheart.
So come down and get it!
Brave lad
I could' ve put a bullet straight down your ear just now if I haven' t gotten my revolver all wet and useless you got the drop on my, love
I' m as helpless as a baby
Better come clean with you, sweetheart
It was an old trade lie I was giving you about my revolver being wet
You see, I' m not too fond of shooting
It' s my preference to blow things off
I should blast the roof off a pulp
I' ve seen all the parts flying off people
Little bang- bang' s never going to match the size of that
And here' s me with all these fine grenades, such a sweet beauty of a remote
But it' s my knife I' il be doing you with
You killed my mates
Someone should' ve told you
Never give an Irishman a good cause for revenge
Deadly little Miho
You won' t feel a thing unless she wants you to
She twists the blade
He feels it
I tell Miho what we' re going to do and how we' re going to do it
I grab poor Dallas' s car phone and make the most important call of my life
First we got to rescue Gail
Then comes the kill
The big fat kill
You just going to stand there and watch this?
You kidding me man?
Like watching old Manute do his thing all night long, and not get tired of it.
I mean, the man' s an artist
Only an artist should be allowed to touch such a beautiful subject
Your skin is perfect
Your nerves... responsive
Beautiful
Just give them what they want, Gail
Becky?
It' s over, Gail.
There' s no fighting them
Dwight' s dead.
They got' s what' s left of that cop we killed
The mob' s going to turn it over to the police chief, the cops are going to mow us down.
We got to cut a deal
You little bitch.
You sold us out
I didn' t have no choice
They was going to hurt my mom
It selfish, you holding out like this.
You' re going to get a lot of girls killed for no good reason
It wasn' t your mom.
We could' ve protected her, and you know it
It was the money, you stupid little bitch
Sure there is money.
Sure you could' ve moved my mom into Old Town and let her know that her own goddamn daughter is a whore
- Break' s your heart - Doesn' t it
They offered me what you couldn' t never offer me
I had to watch out for my own neck
You' re neck.
You' re precious, scrawny, little neck
You' re crazy.
You could' ve ripped my throat out, you crazy whore
Schutz, fetch my blades
Stuka, kill this one
No, I was promised
Stupid little bitch.
You deserve worse
I knew there was a reason I got out of bed this morning
Hey... hey
Nobody, I don' t see nobody
Guys, look
There' s somethign wrapped around it
Some kind of note
Give it to me
The fuck we' re doing?
Out back, everyone, and bring the women
You think, somebody should call me a doctor or something?
McCarthy, you fool
Hey.
Dozens of them
Armed to the teeth
I' m outnumbered, outgunned
But the alley is crooked, dark, and very narrow
They can' t surround me
Sometimes you can beat the odds with a careful choice of where to fight
You can have Old Town.
Just give me the woman
Shut up
Don' t do this
Hey, wait a minute.
Something' s not right
Or I' il plug you
Of course, Mr. McCarthy.
A fair trade.
She' s all yours
Now if you' il explain why we shouldn' t blow both of you to pieces
Dwight, what have you done?
Exactly what I had to... every step of the way
No, it isn' t right.
There wasn' t no tape over his mouth.
How come there' s tape over his mouth
Where the fight counts for a lot
You trick, McCarthy, but it will do you no good
But there' s nothing like having your friends show up with lots of guns
No, McCarthy, you shan' t!
The girls all know the score
No escape
No surrender
No mercy
We got to kill every last rat bastard one of them
Every last one
Not for revenge.
Not because they deserve it. not because it' il make the world a better place
We need a heap of bloody bodies so when mob boss, Wallenquist, looks over his charts of profits and losses, he' il see what it cost him to mess with the girls of Old Town
The valkyrie at my side is shouting and laughing with the pure hate for blood- thirsty joy of the slaughter
And so am I
The fire, baby.
It' il burn us both
There' s no place in this world for our kind of fire
My warrior woman.
My valkyrie
You' il always be mine.
Always.
And never
THAT YELLOW BASTARD
Evening officer
I don' t... have to introduce myself, do I?
You read the papers?
This being an election year, you' ve seen plenty of my picture
You know who I am and what I can do
I' m doing you, Hartigan
Cold and hard, I' m doing you
You blew my son' s ear off
Blew his arm off, you even blew his nuts and his pecker off
He' s in a coma right now, they say he may never come out of it
He could' ve been the first Rourk to become the president of the United States, but you had turned him into a brain damaged dickless freak
Pulling that trigger make you feel powerful?
Power don' t come from a badge, or a gun
Power comes from lying
Lying big and getting the whole damn world to play along with you
Once you got everybody agreeing with what they know in their hearts ain' t true, you get them by the balls
There' s what, maybe 500 people in this hospital
I could pump you full of bullets right now and I wouldn' t be arrested
Everyone would lie for me, everyone who counts
Otherwise all their own lies, everything that runs Sin City, it all comes tumbling down like a pack of cards
But I want you firm, fit, and healthy
Fix that... heart condition of yours
You' re going to keep living a long time, I' m going to make sure of that
You' re going to be convicted of raping that little brat
And shooting my boy
You tell her the truth, and she' s dead
You tell anybody the truth, and they' re dead
They won' t let testify
I told the cops that you saved my life and they just (???) like I was crazy
They talked my parents into keeping me away
They said that you done things that you didn' t do
I told them that you saved me from that Rourk creep
But they won' t even check me out to see if I' m still a virgin
Still a virgin, still alive
Thanks to you
They got it all backwards
Sometimes the truth doesn' t matter like it ought
But you' il always remember things, right?
That' s going to mean a lot to me
Stay away, Nancy
They' il kill you if you don' t stay away
Don' t visit me, don' t write me, don' t even say my name
If you won' t let me visit, but I' il still write to you, Hartigan
I' il sign my letters "Cordelia"
It' s a name of a really cool detective in books I read
I' il write to you every week
For forever
Sure kid
Now run on home
It' s not safe for you hear
Bye, Nancy
I love you
John Hartigan
Mr. "Law and Order"
Mr. "By- The- Book"
Mr. High and Mighty
I got to give you credit.
Being such a straight arrow for so damn many years without it catching up with you
It' s catching up with you now, friend of mine
It' s catching up with you but good
Maybe I had a look at him.
He doesn' t look too good
He' s hailing hard, Tammy.
He' s a picture of hell
That Tammy there.
She' s fine, isn' t she?
I rented her out of Old Town
Not in prison
You hear me, Hartigan?
You stop being stupid
Start playing along with us, you just might get some of Tammy
You see that?
She flinched
You make her sick
She heard about you and that little girl
This is nothing but a price I promised myself I' d pay, and I' m paying it
You don' t save a little girl' s life, and turn around and throw her to the dogs
Not in my book, you don' t
They want a confession.
They won' t get i
There' s a letter from Nancy when they put me in solitary
She calls herself "Cordelia"
She makes no mention of anything that would give her away
At first I figure she' il send another note or 2 before her young mind moves on to better things
But every thursday, another 1 arrives
What a sweet kid
I do my best to keep my hand from shaking when I reach for it
She' s the only friend I got
The daughter I never had
My sweet Cordelia
Skinny little Nancy Callahan
8 years pass
Then comes a Thursday when I bound from my cot, excited as a kid at Christmas
Only to find myself staring at the damn floor of my damn cell
Looking for a letter from Nancy that isn' t there
Then another Thursday with no letter
Is she alright?
Did something happen to her?
Nothing
2 months now.
Not a word from Nancy
Did they find her?
Did they get to her?
Of course.
Stupid old man
Do your math.
Nancy' s 19 years old.
How long did you expect her to keep writing?
She was a saint to give it up as long as she did
She' s forgotten you, old man
You' re alone.
You' re all alone
This guy smells awful, like bad food
Like a corpse left in a garbage dumpster in the middle of summer
He stinks so bad, I want to throw up
Practically knocked my head off, the bastard
When I come to, I see it
The same kind of envelope Nancy always uses
But there' s no letter inside of it
Something soft.
Something that ought to be alive
A hunk of meat and bone that ought to be the index finger of the right hand of a 19 year old girl
How the hell did they find her?
She was so careful.
She never gave away where she lives or where she works
I' ve got to get out.
I' ve got to help.
Nothing else matters
Not my life, and not my pride either
It' s only 1 final surrender they want
You got me Rourk, you beat me
I say everything they want to hear, just the way they want to hear it
I tell them I' m a twisted, retched child molester
I agree to everything they want from me
I love you, Nancy
It' s a lot of miles into town, Hartigan
You care for a ride?
As long as you stay in front of me
Prison' s made you paranoid
Talk about water under the bridge.
Christ
8 years
Yeah, 8 years
Well, if it' s any consolation for you...
You made me hate myself
Yeah.
She got remarried... 4 years ago
She had 2 kids
I' m sorry, John
Don' t be
I' m glad
Aileen always wanted kids
She' il make a good mother
"Water under the bridge"
Bob and I get along with our fond farewells to eachother
And I go looking for the only human being on the planet that means a damn to me
Nancy
How could they have found out it was you writing all those letters to me
How did they find out who you are?
And what have they dont to you, baby?
Not a sound
No sign of life
Has Rourk gone through all this trouble to torture an old man?
Like a kid poking at fly when he' s already torn its wings off?
What has he done to Nancy?
It' s like all she does is read and study and write
No diary.
No phone numbers or addresses written down anywhere
Closest thing to a clue is a pack of matches from a louzy salloon
It' s a long shot, but maybe she' s got some friends there
A dead end
Nancy wouldn' t have anything to do with a pack of drunks and losers like this
But if there' s anything to be found here, the faintest lead to wherever Nancy is or whoever kidnapped her or mutilated her this is the place
Excuse me, miss.
I' m wondering if you could help me
I' m looking for somebody
Well, a night like this, everybody' s looking for somebody, stranger
Her name is Nancy
Eyes to the stage, pilgrim
She' s just warming up
Skinny little Nancy Callahan
She grew up
She filled out
Nancy Callahan, 19 year old
And here I was expecting a skinny little bookworm maybe a bit too shy for her own good how little she told me about herself in all her letters for all those years
How the hell did they find her?
Then it hits me
They were bluffing
I' ve led them straight to her
She hasn' t spotted you yet
Turn around and walk out the door
Lead the creep outside
Get that berretta away from him somehow, and kill him
I' m just a horny ex- con watching an exotic dancer
Just a few seconds and she' il be safe
No, Nancy.
Don' t notice me
Don' t recognize me
There' s no time to explain.
I' ve made a terrible mistake
I put you in terrible danger.
Right this second
Whatever you say, Hartigan.
Let me throw some clothes on
And here I' d figured you' d forget all abotu me.
Me and my dumb letters
Kept me from killing myself
Hurry up, will you?
- Maybe I should drive - Not a chance
Nobody but me can keep this heap running
Besides from the sounds of things, you might have to shoot somebody
I don' t have a gun
Under the seat
It' s loaded and it works
This' il do
Taken it to the range a couple times
Kicks like a mule
There' s so much I' ve wanted to say to you.
You never go far from my thoughts
I' ve lain awake nights, thinking of you
What are you talking about?
Keep driving, Nancy.
Keep driving and keep the car on the road
She' s counting on you, old man
What are you doing?
Prove you' re still worth a damn
Try to keep it on the road, Nancy
He' s a decent shot
But he' s in too much of a hurry
Throwing away bullets like they were candy
He doesn' t know how to take his time
Aim carefull and look the devil in the eye
Stop the car, Nancy.
I' ve got to confirm the kill
- What?
- Stop the car, now!
Right.
Stop the car.
Confirm the kill
Sorry, I got a little rattled
It' s OK.
You did great.
I' il be right back
No.
Let me stay close
Nothing can happen to me when I' m with you
Let me stay close?
The stink.
I almost gag
His blood smells even worse than he does
And it' s all over the place
But the creep, himself... he' s gone
We' re out of time
Sirens.
I used to welcome the sound
There' s nothing to do now but find a place to huddle up for the night
Get Nancy to calm down and figure out what on Earth I' m going to do next
The stink.
Somehow it stays with us all the way to the hotel
Nancy, I went to your apartment.
Your windows thrown wide open
The rooms looks almost empty.
That' s why I' m sure you' d been kidnapped
My window?
Robbed again?
That' s the 3rd time this year
I swore if I ever saw you again, I' d show you I grew up strong
There I was just like before, scared and helpless
- I' m such an asshole - You should sit down.
You' il feel a little bit better if you sit down
I' ve never been all that good with people
I' m as expert as a Paulsy victim doing brain surgery with a pipe wrench
It' s always been you, Hartigan
All these years
It' s just nerves making you say that
I need to sleep
- Sleep with me - Stop it, Nancy
Why do you think I kept writing you those letters
It wasn' t just gratitude
I tried to fall in love with boys
I thought I did once or twice
But I was already in love... with you
That' s enough.
I' m old enough to be your grandfather
- You' re just scared - I' m not scared
No
There' s wrong and there' s wrong and then there' s this
For God' s sakes, you' re just a kid
I love you
I love you, too with all my heart
It helps
No, Nancy
Recognize my voice, Hartigan?
Recognize my voice, you piece of shit cop?
I look different, but I bet you can recognize my voice
Sure, I recognize your voice, Junior
Everything' s going straight to hell
I' ve been suckered into betraying the only friend I got
And put her in the hands of a murdering rapist I thought I put down for good
Suckered by a spoiled brat, son of a senator
It' s all gone to hell
Klump.
It' s me
I got a dead man needs to be fetched
I want you to set me up for a party
I' ve already got the girl, you dumb shit
It better be perfect or I' m calling my dad
My tools better be clean and sharp
Better be ready.
It better be perfect
I get to do whatever I want
However I want, whenever I want it
My dad.
I' d love him if I didn' t hate him
He spent a fortune hiring every expert on the planet to grow back that equipment you blew off from between my legs
Just so the old fart can hold out some kind of hope of having a grandkid
Although, as you can see, there were some... side effects
I' m not complaining though.
Since you' ve been gone, I' ve been having the time of my life
Now you' ve led me back to your darling Cordelia
We all wondered who wrote all those letters.
She left not a clue
Clever girl.
So pretty, so pretty
Little old for my taste, but I can forgive that just this once
Nancy, don' t scream.
Whatever he does to you, don' t scream
She' il scream.
I' m going to take all night doing dear old Nancy.
And you' re going to die knowing it' s all your fault
Dozens of them.
Maybe a hundred 8 years worth.
Every one of them screamed
And if there weren' t so many people hear about, I would show you how to make dear old Nancy scream
It' s going to be 1 hell of a show
This is it.
No way to fight it now
No hope left
No chance
This is it
This is the end
No
Give it a shot, old man.
Keep your neck tight
Move.
The window.
Maybe there' s an alarm
The window.
Keep your neck tight, God dammit.
Stay conscious
Stay conscious
No alarm
The glass.
Cut the rope.
You can do it
You can do it
Irrelevent to said mission, is the following queary which I now put forth to you
Where in this most streamlined and trunkless of transports, boner inspiring though it may be, where in, are we to reposit our recently deceased cargo?
I can only express puzzlement that borders on alarm
Show me where Roark takes the girls, or I' il cut your damn head off
In plain english, creep
He had to (???)
Even agrarian (???)...
The Farm
That' s all I need to hear
Every cop on the force knows about the Roark Family' s farm and to stay away from it
Shlubb and Klump were packing an arsenal
Once things get loud, I' il probably have use for the cannons
But at first, I' il have to play it quiet
Quiet and nasty
Nancy' s car.
6 miles from the Farm
"Nobody but me can keep this heap running" she told me
Good girl
The car stalled out on that yellow bastard you kept your mouth shut.
I bet he slapped you around something fierce
But you stayed strong.
You bought a few extra minutes
There' s still a chance, Nancy
Don' t scream
I ditch the car a mile or so from the Farm and make my way through the woods
I' m not half way there when it hits
My heart
It can' t be my heart.
I was cured
Bad cough
Blood in it.
Doesn' t matter now
I don' t have to stay alive that much longer anyway
Rotten way to kill a man
But it' s quiet
Hate yourself later
You' re only making it worse for yourself, you stupid cow!
Is that it?
You think I' m getting tired?
You' re the one who' s going to crack.
You' il crack!
You' il cry and beg
You' il scream
You' il scream
You thinking the whip is the best I could do?
That was foreplay
Hartigan was right about you.
You can' t get it up unless I scream
You' re pathetic pathetic
That' s not wise at all to make fun of me like that
It brings out the worst in me
Stupid old man
In too much of a hurry
Damn.
It can' t be!
Charging in like Gallahad, just like I told myself I wouldn' t
Stupid old man
- Attacked him good - Don' t take no chances.
Perferate the fool
Good advice
Give it up, Junior
It' s over.
Let her go
You' re dreaming Hartigan
I get to see your eyes while I fillet the woman of your dreams right in front of you
Look at you.
You' re about to keel over, you can' t even lift that cannon
Sure I can
You gave me the scare there for a second, old man
Nancy, I' m sorry
I' m taking no chances with you
First I soften you up, and then it' s showtime
Here it comes
It' s going to hurt
You' re right about that
Sucker
I take away his weapon
Both of them
So I stop
Been a pleasure
I didn' t scream, Hartigan
Not once
I didn' t scream
I know it, baby
You grew up strong
By the time I get her to the car, Nancy stops shaking
Her skin is warm again
She' s herself again
Thanks for remembering my coat
Like saving my life... twice
You better get rolling
No.
I have friends on their way
To collect evidence.
I' m going to blow this whole sick mess wide open
I' m going to clear my name.
I' m going to put Senator Roark behind bars, where he belongs
Can' t lose you.
Not again
You' il never lose me, Nancy
Nancy Callahan.
The love of my life
Shame to lie to her.
I hope she forgives me for it
Sure.
And maybe after I' ve pulled off that miracle, I' il go and punch out God
I killed his only son.
The bloodline is cut
Roark' s lost his goddamn legacy
He' il use all his power to get revenge on me
He' il go after me through Nancy
He' il find her again.
There' il be no end to it
She' il never be safe.
Not as long as I' m alive
There' s only one way to beat him
A young woman lives
Fair trade
I love you, Nancy
Uh- huh... yes
Oh mom.
Don' t go on like that
It' s not the city.
I could' ve gotten in a car accident anywhere
Yeah, just a fracture
The doctor said, it' s a clean break.
Should be right as rain in no time
Uh- huh
Turn the right corner in Sin City and you can find... anything
Becky?
Care for a smoke?
I love you too, mom
Anything
Return into Egypt. ’’
And Moses took his wife and his son and he returned to the land of Egypt.
And Moses took the rod of God in his hand. ’
Let the ambassador from Priam, king of Troy, approach the Pharaoh.
Great Pharaoh, the gift of Troy is a fabulous fabric from the land of the five rivers.
Our thanks to Priam.
It is fabulous indeed.
- It shimmers like the Nile.
- How is it made?
No one knows.
It is spun on the looms of the gods.
They call it silk.
The ambassador from Jericho.
What kingdom has sent you?
The kingdom of the Most High.
- What gifts do you bring?
- We bring you the word of God.
What is this word?
Thus sayeth the Lord God of lsrael, ’’ Let my people go! ’’
The slaves are mine.
Their lives are mine.
All that they own is mine.
I do not know your God, nor will I let lsrael go.
Who are you to make their lives bitter in bondage?
Men shall be ruled by law, not the will of other men.
Who is this God that I should let your people go?
Aaron.
Cast down my staff before Pharaoh that he may see the power of God.
ln this you shall know that the Lord is God.
Mother!
He turned his staff into a cobra!
Nothing of HlS will harm you, my son.
The power of your God is a cheap magician’ s trick.
Jannes.
Mother, look!
Jannes, do you see?
Moses ’ serpent swallows up the others.
You gave me this staff to rule over scorpions and serpents, but God made it a rod to rule over kings.
Hear his word, Rameses, and obey.
Obey?
Are there no magicians in Egypt that you have come back to make serpents out of sticks?
Or cause rabbits to appear?
I will give your staff a greater wonder to perform.
Bear it before your idle people and bid them make bricks without straw.
- How can that be done?
- Let his staff provide them.
Or let them glean straw for themselves.
But their tally of bricks shall not diminish.
So let it be written.
So let it be done.
Aaron, when do we leave Egypt?
We do not leave Egypt.
But Moses promised us.
But you said we’ d be freed!
I have brought more evil upon you.
God forgive my weak use of his strength.
(Man) Moses, what have you done to us?
It is Pharaoh ’ s order that you be given no straw to make your tally of bricks.
No straw?
How can we make bricks without straw?
You will glean the fields by night.
Your women and children, too.
ls this the deliverer?
You’ ve brought the wrath of Pharaoh upon us!
You put a sword in their hands!
Stone him!
Stone him!
Stand aside!
Come!
Follow!
There goes your deliverer.
Now go find your straw.
Remember the tally must be the same.
Not one brick less.
Each time Rameses took me in his arms I cursed you, not him, because I love you.
The Moses who loved you was another man.
No, he was not.
You believe you’ ve changed, but you haven’ t.
You call yourself a prophet, a man of God, but I know better.
I don’ t believe only the thunder of a mountain stirs your heart, as you stir mine.
Nefretiri, I have stood in the burning light of God’ s own presence.
It was not he who saved you just now.
I did that.
Why, of all men, did I fall in love with the prince of fools?
But I believe anything you tell me when l’ m in your arms.
Why must you deny me and yourself?
Because I am bound to a God and to a people and to a shepherd girl.
A shepherd girl?
What can she be to you?
Unless the desert sun has dulled your senses.
Does she... grate garlic on her skin?
Or is it soft as mine?
Are her lips chafed and dry as the desert sand?
Or are they moist and red like a pomegranate?
ls it the fragrance of myrrh that scents her hair?
Or is it the odour of sheep?
There is a beauty beyond the senses, Nefretiri.
Beauty like the quiet of green valleys and still waters.
Beauty whose spirit you cannot understand.
Perhaps not.
But beauty of the spirit will not free your people, Moses.
YOU will come to me or THEY will never leave Egypt.
The fate of lsrael is not in your hands, Nefretiri.
Oh, isn’ t it?
Who else can soften Pharaoh ’ s heart?
Or harden it?
Yes.
You may be the lovely dust through which God will work his purpose.
Fill every jar with water.
For seven days there will be none to drink.
- But this well has never run dry.
- And the river is high.
- Whose word is that?
- One who knows.
So fill your jars or go thirsty.
- Miriam is always right.
- Yes, l’ m going back for more jars.
Yes, Joshua.
She comes to the well every day.
Wait and you will see her.
It is wise of Dathan to send you to the well, Lilia, or he might find his water poisoned.
They told me you were dead.
To all I love, Joshua, I am dead.
- Dathan?
- Yes.
Dathan.
Of your own free will?
Of my own free will.
You are no man’ s slave.
The hour of deliverance has come.
Not for me, Joshua.
Hail to thee, great god of the Nile!
Thy waters are the blood of Egypt.
Hail to thee, maker of barley, feeder of cattle, carrier of ships, greatest of all the gods.
Pharaoh of Egypt!
You have not yet obeyed the Lord.
Let my people go!
The point of the sword...
Let him rave that men shall know him mad.
Obey the Lord or he will raise his hand against the waters of the river.
I have come to bless the waters, you have come to curse them.
We will learn if a shepherd god is stronger than the gods of Pharaoh.
Water of life, give drink to the desert and make green the meadow.
Aaron.
Stretch out my staff against the waters.
Look!
Where he’ s touched the river, it bleeds.
The water turns to blood!
Blood flows from the god!
See how it spreads.
It lS blood!
That you may know the power of the Lord, for seven days, Egypt will thirst.
- Seven days without water!
- Pestilence will be everywhere!
Were it seven times seven days, no magician’ s trick will set your people free.
Sacred water, make pure the flood from which you came.
’ And God smote the land with all manner of plagues, ’ but still Pharaoh ’ s heart was hardened. ’
Great one, you hear the cry of Egypt.
They would cry louder if THEY had to make the bricks.
Send them away.
The people have been plagued by thirst, by frogs, by lice, by flies.
They can endure no more.
Why do you bring this worker of evil before me?
The people desert the temples and turn from the gods.
What gods?
You prophets and priests MADE the gods, that you may prey upon the fears of men.
When the Nile ran red, I too was afraid... until word came of a mountain beyond the cataracts which spewed red mud and poisoned the water.
Was it the staff that caused this?
Was it the wonder of your god that fish died and frogs left the water?
Was it a miracle that flies and lice should bloat upon their carrion and spread disease?
These things were ordered by themselves, not by any god!
Now go.
That you may know these things are done of God...
you shall see hail fall from a clear sky and burn as fire upon the ground.
You shall see darkness cover Egypt when the sun climbs high to noon.
And you shall know that God is God and bow down to his will.
Nothing of this Earth can make me bow to you, Moses.
Behold, the hail comes.
When darkness has covered Egypt for three days, your ministers will send for me.
ln the three days of darkness, you have whined like frightened children in the night.
Moses said the sun would shine in three days and it is true.
Let his people go, or Egypt will be barren from the cataracts to the sea.
Will my father free the slaves?
Can taxes be collected from blighted harvests?
Does fear rule Egypt... or do l?
We fear no army of the Earth, but can we fight plagues with swords?
There is no shame in this.
It is not Pharaoh who yields to the slave, but his counsellors.
I have summoned Moses at your request.
(Counsellor) People will bless you, great one.
Does the world bow to an empty throne?
Empty?
Does a Pharaoh harden his heart against his son?
lf you let the Hebrews go, who will build HlS cities?
You told Moses to make bricks without straw.
Now HE tells YOU to make cities without bricks!
Who is the slave... and who is the Pharaoh?
Do you hear laughter, Rameses?
Yes, the laughter of kings in Babylon, in Canaan, in Troy... as Egypt surrenders to the god of slaves!
Bring the Hebrew in.
Go into the garden.
lt’ s not good for a son of Pharaoh to see his father humbled by a son of slaves.
My son, stand beside me.
Have the days of darkness made you see the light, Rameses?
Will you now free my people?
Great one, bid the scribe read the order.
Give me the writing.
You cannot resist the power of his god!
I know not his god!
Neither will I let his people go.
How long will you refuse to humble yourself before God?
lf you bring another plague upon us, it is not your god but I who will turn the Nile red with blood.
As your father’ s father did with the blood of our male children!
lf there is one more plague on Egypt, it is by YOUR word that God will bring it.
And there shall be so great a cry throughout the land that you will surely let the people go.
Come to me no more, Moses, for on the day you see my face again, you will surely die.
So let it be written.
I will give this spawn of slaves and his god an answer the world will not forget!
Commander of the Host, call on the chariots from Talis.
There SHALL be one more plague... only it will come upon the slaves of Goshen!
First- born of each house shall die, beginning with the son of Moses.
You are the shepherd girl that Moses married?
The queen of Egypt lS beautiful... as he told me.
My husband is not here.
ls this Moses ’ son?
Yes, this is our son.
What do you want of us?
You need have no fear of me.
I feared only his memory of you.
You have been able to erase it?
He has forgotten both of us.
You lost him when he went to seek his god.
I lost him when he found his god.
At least he left you a son to cherish.
I am here to save his son.
From what?
From Pharaoh ’ s decree that the first- born of lsrael must die.
Die?
God of Abraham!
Don’ t let him do this!
Not to the children!
A caravan for Midian awaits you and your son.
My chariot will take you to it.
l’ m surprised you noticed me.
You didn’ t at the palace this morning.
Why?
Were you afraid to look at me?
What do you want, Nefretiri?
You, Moses.
Everything about us is coming to an end!
You will destroy Egypt or Egypt will destroy you.
I belong to you, Moses.
She’ s gone with your son to Midian.
Why did she leave?
She knew you’ d try to save the other children before your own son.
From what?
Rameses is massing the Libyan axemen, the chariots, Sardinian swordsmen.
Why?
Tell me why!
To destroy the first- born of lsrael.
Oh, God!
My God!
Out of his own mouth comes thy judgement!
But I have saved your son!
It is not my son who will die!
It is the first- born of Egypt!
YOUR son, Nefretiri!
You would not dare strike Pharaoh ’ s son!
ln the hardness of his heart, Pharaoh brings death to his own son!
But he’ s MY son, Moses.
You would not harm MY son?
I, myself, am nothing.
God’ s power uses me to work his will.
You would not let him do this to me.
I saved YOUR son.
I cannot save yours.
Your god listens to you, Moses.
About midnight, the destroyer will come into the midst of Egypt and all the first- born shall die, from the first- born of Pharaoh to the first- born of his servants.
When you were Prince of Egypt, you held me in your arms.
I threw myself at your feet before the court of Pharaoh.
Because I loved you, Moses.
It is the Lord who executes judgement, Nefretiri.
Go back to your son.
Your love for me is stronger than the power of any god.
You will not kill my son.
Turn from thy fierce wrath, O Lord!
# To set me free
# Death cometh to me... #
No, Lilia, death will not come to you.
Joshua, you risk your life in coming here.
- You are first- born.
- So are you.
I bring lamb’ s blood to mark the doorposts and lintel... that the Angel of Death may pass you by.
Joshua, it is enough that you have come to me.
I am outcast among our people.
Don’ t save me from death, Joshua, save me from life.
Tomorrow will bring a new world.
No!
And no blood on this door!
Dathan, it will save her life!
Moses has God’ s promise!
Moses has words, Pharaoh has spears.
Remember, Joshua, of her own free will she’ s mine.
# And under his wing shalt thou trust # ’’ Though we stand in the shadow of death, ’’ the Lord is our God.
The Lord is one. ’’ (All) ’’ The Lord is one. ’’
# His truth shall be thy shield... # ’’ Shield us through this night of terror, O King of the Universe. ’’ (Woman screams)
Why is this night different from all others?
Because this night the Lord will free us from the bondage of Egypt.
# Thou shalt not be afraid of the terror by night # (Knock at door)
Or worse!
# Or from the arrow that flyeth by day #
Bithiah!
ln fear of your god they have set me free.
May a stranger enter?
There are no strangers among those who seek God’ s mercy.
My bearers?
All who thirst for freedom may come with us.
The darkness of death will pass over us tonight.
Tomorrow the light of freedom will shine upon us as we go forth from Egypt.
I shall go with you, Moses.
- A princess of Egypt!
- From the house of Pharaoh!
An idol- worshipper!
This woman drew me from the Nile and set my feet upon the path of knowledge.
Mered, bring a chair for Pharaoh ’ s daughter.
There is a great light shines from your face.
Perhaps some day I shall understand it.
He is God’ s messenger, Princess.
lf it is not forbidden to look upon the breath of pestilence, then see, for it is here.
Do not look, Eleazar.
Close the door, Joshua, and let death pass.
Will it pass?
That is God’ s promise, Elisheba.
’’ Blessed art thou, o Lord our God ’’ Who bringeth forth bread from the earth. ’’ (Distant shouting)
Run!
There shall no evil befall you... or any plagues come near you.
# A thousand shall fall at thy sight #
Why do we eat unleavened bread and bitter herbs?
(Hoofbeats outside) (Man) Faster!
Take the other road!
The herbs remind us of the bitterness of captivity, Eleazar.
This is the bread of haste, that you will remember this night from generation to generation forever.
(Woman) Give me back my baby!
- They are my people!
- All are God’ s people.
Death is all around us!
But it passes those who have believed the Lord.
Always remember, Eleazar... he passed over your house.
Are the captains of Egypt afraid of a night mist?
- The death cry is everywhere.
- Some devil’ s curse!
Look!
l’ ve known battle for 30 years, Pharaoh, but never fear till tonight.
Aide.
Have the captains join their men.
At the coming of dawn we will strike.
No first- born Hebrew shall live.
Let the Hebrews go, great one, or we are all dead men.
He was your son?
My first- born.
There is no magic cure, no spell to use.
He is the first- born of Pharaoh.
We have no skill before this... pestilence.
My father.
My son.
Your own curse is on him.
- Where did you hear this?
- From Moses.
I would not let his people go because your serpent’ s tongue hardened my heart.
You only thought to keep Moses here.
You cared nothing for my throne... or my son.
I asked Moses for his life.
The shadow of death is on his face.
He will not die.
Captain.
Take my fastest chariot.
Bring Moses to me.
I will bring him, mighty Pharaoh.
He’ s my only son.
You have conquered, Moses.
The foot of a slave is on the neck of Egypt.
You were saved from the Nile to be a curse upon me.
Your shadow fell between me and my father, between me and my fame, between me and my queen.
Your shadow now fills all things with death.
Go out from among us, you and your people.
I set you free.
It is not by your word, nor by my hand that we are free, Pharaoh.
The power of God has freed us.
Enough of your words!
Take your people, your cattle, your god and your pestilence.
Take what spoils from Egypt you will!
But go!
O Lord God... with a strong hand thou dost bring us out of bitter bondage.
Tomorrow we go forth a free nation.
For every man shall reap what he has sown and bow no knee except in prayer.
We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters...
With our flocks and with our herds will we go, for I know that the Lord is great and that our Lord is above all gods.
He’ s dead.
Soca, great lord of the lower world...
I, who have denied the gods of Egypt, bow before you now.
Show that you have power above the god of Moses, and restore the life he has taken from my son.
Guide back his soul across the lake of death to the place of living men, and I will raise a temple to you mightier than the pyramids.
Hear me, dread lord of darkness...
Arise, O lsrael!
Behold the dawn of freedom!
’ And it came to pass, after the stifling night of terror, ’ came a day such as the world had never seen. ’ From east and west, from north and south, ’ they came with all they had, driving their flocks ’ and their herds and their camels before them. ’ By tens, by hundreds, by thousands, ’ unending streams of man and beast and burden, ’ and even very much cattle, ’ poured into the Avenue of Sphinxes. ’ Beneath the stone feet of the four colossal images of Rameses, ’ which their own sweat and blood and sinew ’ had hewn from solid rock, ’ a nation arose and freedom was born into the world. ’
(Child) Father, have you got Rebekka?
No, I haven’ t got Rebekka.
Here’ s the trough.
Sling it on your shoulders.
This is a blessed day!
- Here’ s Rebekka!
- Thank you!
- Can we take the cow?
- We’ re moving to the gates.
Rachel, help me with this brick yoke.
Don’ t forget the oil for the baths!
Where are we going?
To some land flowing with milk and honey!
l’ ve never tasted honey.
Anybody know the way?
lt’ s away from the whip!
Freedom will wet your throats in the desert.
This is the governor’ s house!
You cannot enter.
Out!
All of you!
Why do soldiers come here?
I put no blood on my door.
Then stone bleeds!
Your stonecutter did this to me!
All your gold cannot wipe that mark from your door... or from my heart.
For that, you’ il walk all the way to...
Where are we going?
Do you know where we’ re going?
To hell, I hope!
’ Like Dathan, they did not know where they were going, ’ and cared no more than their flocks. ’ Now they used the brick yokes for a very different burden. ’ There went forth among them ’ planters of vineyards and sowers of seeds, ’ each hoping to sit under his own vine and fig tree. ’ Out of this glorious chaos, ’ it is Joshua who brings order and purpose. ’
Set the standard of each tribe before the people!
Levite in the centre, Judah to the right, Hephron left.
(Woman) Watch where you’ re going!
Watch out for my geese!
Aaron and the elders are carrying a shrouded body, Grandfather!
They are the bones of Joseph, to rest in his own land.
Nubians, Grandfather!
- Here come treasure wagons!
- Spoils of Egypt.
Here, boy!
For the blind one!
A little golden calf, Grandfather, with horns!
An idol.
For idol- worshippers!
There are the fire- bearers!
Plant your fires at night beside the standards, that all may light their torches!
Eleazar, hang this on the wagon.
Now the cradle...
I have wagons for midwives and physicians.
Place them at 5, 000 cubits...
l’ il pay you back every lash you gave me, Dathan!
- ls this a day for hard feelings?
- l’ ve felt your whip!
Lilia is no slave, Dathan!
You can carry your own carton.
(Others laugh)
So, now, my brother, we have NEW task- masters.
We serve no masters now!
Yes, but not for long.
That’ s it.
- Joshua!
Make way for the governor!
- You know who I am.
- I know who you WERE.
Go and tell Rameses l’ m coming back to my house.
That rabble may follow Moses into the desert today, but when their eyes are seared red by the sun and their cracked lips bleed with thirst, when their stomachs cramp with hunger, they will curse the name of Moses and his god.
Then I will lead them back to Pharaoh and the brick pits.
There are so many.
So many.
How shall I find thy road through the wilderness, Lord?
How shall I find water in the desert for this multitude?
Moses... the people are assembled.
Then let us go forth to the mountain of God, that he may write his commandments in our minds and hearts forever.
We march, praising his mighty name!
- What is the word, Joshua?
- Let the trumpets sound!
Hear, O lsrael!
Remember this day, when the strong hand of the Lord leads you out of bondage!
(All) The Lord is our God!
The Lord is one!
The Lord is our God!
The Lord is one!
Come on!
- Yes!
Joshua!
400 years in bondage and TODAY he won’ t move!
# The Lord is one!
Praise to God...
# Thank thee, O Lord... #
My litter can carry him.
I am poured out like water, my strength dried up into the dust... of death.
- We shall plant your fig tree!
- Children shall eat of its fruit!
Do you hear that?
You have a strong new son!
’ And he brought forth the people with joy and gladness. ’ He bore them out of Egypt ’ as an eagle bears its young upon its wings. ’ But again...
Pharaoh ’ s heart was hardened. ’
How many more days and nights will you pray?
Does he hear you?
Dread Lord of Darkness, are you not greater than the god of Moses?
I have raised my voice to you, yet life has not come to the body of my son.
- Hear me!
- He cannot hear you.
He’ s nothing but a piece of stone with the head of a bird.
He WlLL hear me.
I am Egypt.
Egypt?
You are nothing.
You let Moses kill my son.
No god can bring him back.
What have you done to Moses?
How did he die?
Did he cry for mercy when you tortured him?
I want to see it!
This is my son.
He would have been Pharaoh.
He would have ruled the world.
Who mourns him now?
Not even you.
All you can think of is Moses.
You will not see his body.
I drove him out of Egypt.
I cannot fight the power of his god.
HlS god?
The priests say that Pharaoh is a god, but you are not a god, you are even less than a man.
Listen to me, Rameses, you thought I was evil when I went to Moses, and you were right.
Shall I tell you what happened, Rameses?
He spurned me, like a strumpet in the street.
I, Nefretiri, Queen of Egypt!
All that you wanted from me he would not even take.
Do you hear laughter, Pharaoh?
Not the laughter of kings, but the laughter of slaves on the desert!
Laughter?
Laughter?
My son, I shall build your tomb upon their crushed bodies!
lf any escape, their seed shall be scattered and accursed forever!
My armour.
War crown.
Laughter?
I will turn the laughter of these slaves into wails of torment!
They SHALL remember the name of Moses, only that he died under my chariot wheels!
Kill him with your own hands.
Let the trumpet sound.
Alert the watch towers.
Assemble all the chariots at the city gate.
I obey!
Ready my chariot.
I will bring you back your temple treasure!
Bring it back to me stained with his blood.
I will!
To mingle with your own!
(Commander) Salute!
(All) Hail!
(All) Hail!
Remember your first- born!
- (All) Death to the slaves!
- Death to their god!
Hail!
Forward!
Do you hear thunder?
Over the sea?
No, it comes from the desert.
That’ s the thunder of horses!
Look!
Pharaoh ’ s chariot!
We’ re trapped against the sea!
Caleb, warn the north tents!
Joshua?
That’ s Joshua’ s horn!
All men to the pass!
Get horses, wagons!
Form a barrier!
What’ s the alarm?
Pharaoh ’ s chariot!
Block the pass with carts!
Women and children, to the sea!
Bring shovels!
Mallets!
Hear me!
Can mallets stop arrows?
Will your cart stop Pharaoh ’ s chariots?
Women, do you want your men killed?
Moses!
Pharaoh ’ s chariots!
l’ ve ordered men to block the pass!
- We can’ t fight chariots!
- Order the men to move back, Joshua.
Move back?
Where? lnto the sea?
lnto the hand of God.
Deliverer?
He’ s delivered you to death!
Look!
Blame Moses for this!
Deliver him to Pharaoh!
(All) Yes!
Stone him!
The god of Moses is a poor general... to leave him no retreat.
Ten times you have seen the miracles of the Lord!
And still you have no faith!
He delivers you to death!
Stone him!
Stone him!
Listen to Moses!
He speaks God’ s will!
- They will stop for me!
- A chariot knows no rank.
Was it because there where no graves in Egypt that you took us to die in the wilderness?
Fear not!
Stand still and see the salvation of the Lord!
- A pillar of fire!
- The work of God!
Through it!
You cannot breach the fire of God!
Gather your families and flocks.
We must go with all speed.
Go where?
To drown in the sea?
How long can the fire hold?
After this day you shall see his chariots no more!
No!
You’ il be dead under them!
The Lord of Hosts will do battle for us!
Behold his mighty hand!
The wind opens the sea!
God opens the sea with the blast of his nostrils!
- Lead them through the waters.
- His will be done!
He opens the waters for them and he bars our way with fire.
Men cannot fight a god!
Better to die in battle with a god, than live in shame.
Praise God and down into it!
God has delivered us!
- Help us!
- Never mind the wheel!
Pull for your lives!
ls your life worth so much?
Save the bread if you can!
Bring Caleb to help with the wagons!
Moses!
Stand on the rock where the people can see you and have hope!
Above us!
The fire dies!
Sound the pursuit!
Chariots, halt!
This is work for a butcher, not a Pharaoh.
Destroy them all.
But bring Moses to me alive.
Level spears!
Forward!
- Here!
Take him!
Wait!
Grandfather, look, the horses are coming!
The chariots!
Run!
Better to serve than to die here!
Who shall withstand the power of God?
Thou didst blow with thy winds and the sea covered them!
Who is like unto Thee, O Lord?
From everlasting to everlasting... Thou art God!
(All) The Lord is one!
The Lord is one!
Before you strike... show me his blood on your sword.
You couldn’ t even kill him.
His god... lS God.
’ And Moses led lsrael from the Red Sea ’ into the wilderness of Sinai. ’ And they camped before the holy mountain. ’ And when the people saw ’ that Moses delayed to come down out of the mountain, ’ they gathered together. ’
Could anyone live on that summit for 40 days and nights?
- Yes!
By the will of God!
- Who knows the will of God?
Do you?
Do l?
Or you, Sephora?
His grieving wife.
She came back to find her husband.
But even she cannot hope he lives!
Moses went up into the forbidden ground to receive God’ s law!
But he’ s not returned!
We share your pain.
We sympathise.
But will sympathy lead us to this land flowing with milk and honey?
(Man) Now we have no leader!
Moses WlLL return... AAH!
let Moses die before his work is done?
His mother!
So beautiful is the hope of a mother!
But there are other mothers among you!
What will become of your children?
- We must have faith!
- Faith in what?
You, Aaron?
Can you lead us to this land of promise?
- Do you know where it is?
- Across the wilderness!
- Then who is to lead us?
- YOU, Dathan!
Where could I bring you but Egypt?
- Where there is death?
- No!
Where there is food!
- Pharaoh would kill us.
- Not with a god of Egypt before us!
- Make one, Aaron.
- Aaron knows the art of the temple!
(Others implore)
He will not!
He would rather see our flesh rot in the wilderness.
You WlLL make a god for us!
A god of gold!
A golden calf!
Korah shall be the high priest!
Shawls!
Anything you have!
Take off your earrings, your bracelets, your necklaces...
Aaron will make us a golden calf!
- The gold we took from Egypt!
- There!
From the burning bush, O Lord, you charged me to bring the people to this holy mountain, to behold your glory and receive your law.
What have I left undone?
’ l am... ’ l am... ’ l am the Lord thy God. ’ Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
’ Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image.
’ And they overlaid the image with pure gold. ’ And Aaron fashioned it and smoothed it with the hammer, ’ ready to be graven by cunning art and man’ s device. ’ And he fastened it with nails that it should not move. ’ And he that smote the anvil ’ did beat the molten gold into thin plates. ’ For they had gathered their treasure into the midst of the furnace, ’ and did blow the fire upon it to melt it. ’ And they adorned themselves in rich apparel and costly array, ’ veils of blue, purple and scarlet, and fine linen wrought in Egypt. ’ And the women tread grapes into new wine. ’ ’ Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.
’ Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.
’ Honour thy father and thy mother.
’ Thou shalt not kill. ’
(Cheering) ’ And the people sinned a great sin, ’ for they had made them a god of gold. ’ And they bore him upon their shoulders and rejoiced, ’ saying, ’’ This be our god, O lsrael. ’’’
Are you mourners of Moses afraid to face the new god? ’ Then they were as children who have lost their faith. ’ They were perverse and crooked and rebellious against God.
They did eat the bread of wickedness, ’ and drank the wine of violence, ’ and did evil in the eyes of the Lord. ’ And the people cried, ’’’ The graven image hath brought us joy, ’’ ’ and they worshipped the golden calf and sacrificed unto it. ’
Here is your sacrifice!
’ Thou shalt not commit adultery.
’ Thou shalt not steal.
’ Thou shalt not bear false witness ’ against thy neighbour.
’ Thou shalt not covet anything that is thy neighbour’ s. ’
(Moses) Written with the finger of God.
’ Go!
Get thee down, ’ for thy people have corrupted themselves. ’
’ And the people rose up to play and did eat and drink. ’ They were as the children of fools ’ and cast off their clothes. ’ The wicked were like a troubled sea ’ whose waters cast up mire and dirt. ’ They sank from evil to evil and were viler than the earth. ’ And there was rioting and drunkenness, ’ for they had become servants of sin. ’ There was manifest all manner of ungodliness and works of the flesh. ’ Even adultery and lasciviousness, ’ uncleanness, idolatry and rioting, ’ vanity and wrath. ’ And they were filled with iniquity and vile affections. ’ And Aaron knew that he had brought them to shame. ’
Abiram!
Korah!
Bind the sacrifice with cord!
Even unto the horns of the altar!
The light of God shines from you, Moses.
Do not kneel to me, Joshua.
These tablets of stone...
The writing of God.
His Ten Commandments.
There is a noise of war in the camp.
It is not the noise of war.
It is the noise of song and revelry.
Moses!
Joshua!
Woe unto thee, oh lsrael.
You have sinned a great sin in the sight of God!
You are not worthy to receive these Ten Commandments.
Aaron!
We are gathered against you, Moses!
You take too much upon yourself!
We will not live by your commandments.
We are free!
There is no freedom without the law.
Whose law?
Yours?
Did you carve the tablets to become a prince over us?
let him come to me!
(Confused shouts)
- You have cursed us.
- These people made me.
He showed you no milk and honey!
I show you a god of gold!
Come with me!
Follow me!
Blasphemers! ldolaters!
For this you shall drink bitter waters!
God has set before you this day his laws of life and good and death and evil.
Those who will not live by the law... (Shouts of panic) shall die by the law!
’ And the Lord’ s anger was kindled against lsrael. ’ And to prove whether they would keep his commandments or no, ’ he made them wander in the wilderness 40 years, ’ until the generation that had done evil in the sight of the Lord ’ was consumed. ’ But Moses ’ eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. ’ And he went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountains, ’ and the Lord showed him all the land ’ that was beyond the river Jordan. ’
The Lord was angry with me because I disobeyed him by the waters of strife.
And he said unto me, ’’ Behold the new land with thine eyes. ’’ Thou shalt not cross over this river Jordan. ’’
Then I shall stay.
I am called by the Lord, Sephora.
I go alone.
Look, Moses.
The people have come to the river Jordan.
ln the Ark they carry the law you brought them.
You taught them not to live by bread alone.
You are God’ s torch, that lights the way to freedom.
I love you.
Joshua, I charge you and strengthen you, for you shall go over Jordan to lead the people.
As for me and my house, we shall serve the Lord.
Mered, give me the books.
Eleazar... set these five books in the Ark of the Covenant, by the tablets of the Ten Commandments, which the Lord restored unto us.
Go.
Proclaim liberty throughout all the lands, unto all the inhabitants thereof.
I' ve been waiting for 15 minutes.
- Thought you were stuck in traffic?
- You got all the paperwork?
- Yeah.
Are you pissed off at me?
I' m just doing my part.
- You' re my guy, Jerry, my guy.
- Yes, I' il put you through.
Is that Nayman' s little nephew?
- Yeah, that' s Big Tom.
Sure, it is.
- How' s it goin 'there, Big Tom?
Shh.
Why are you scaring the kid?
- Did you get that passport?
Yes.
- Issues, Jerry.
It burns my ass to write you a cheque every week.
I can explain what happened.
You say that when it' s once in a while.
- It' s every time, Jerry.
- It' s every fuckin 'time.
But I' ve been having some personal problems... uh, with my life.
My girlfriend, she' s a great girl, but she has complaints.
I don' t but, she does.
I can' t even believe this, but we go to a group.
So... last week, when you guys told me to pick up the thing at the thing, well, Samantha says she needs the car to pick up some things.
And, I don' t have to tell you boys, I mean, things got heated, right?
And she hid them.
She hid them?
Oh!
She...
You know, and I couldn' t get to the thing on time, and it all got messed up and I think that maybe...
Maybe some things aren' t meant to happen.
Jerry, you' re a fucking moron.
Here are your options.
Number one, I roll you up in a carpet, stuff you in a Sedan and set fire to you.
- You with me?
Choice one.
You like sex and travel??
What, you like to have sex?
Get on a flight to Mexico.
All the hookers you can shake your stick at.
Pick up a pistol that belongs to Margolese.
- What' s it gonna be?
- OK, I was under the impression with Margolese getting out of jail, that the last job was my last job.
- You fucked up that job.
This job will be your last job.
OK, but a trip right now...
He asked for you.
Want me to call him and say you can' t go?
Because I' il call.
You' re goin 'on a fucking trip.
The town' s called San Miguel.
You look for a kid in a bar, the El Alamo.
This is a simple fucking task.
Roll up your sleeves.
- Get involved!
- Ow!
He' s got this particular gun.
He' s waiting on you.
- When you find him, bring him and the gun back Stateside, got it?
Last chance, Jerry.
Even he' s getting tired of your shit.
I' il take care of it, Bernie.
Vaya con Dios, motherfucker.
Baby, what are you doing?
You said this was your last job!
What do you want me to say?
"Sorry I can' t,
"the old lady wants me to quit.
Something like that.
I' m not in insurance, sweetie!
If you get on that plane, you will never, never, ever see me again.
We talked about this.
I wanted us to go to Las Vegas for me.
- Baby, you' re overreacting.
Don' t do that!
Don' t diminish my needs.
Sweetheart, I don' t have a choice.
- I go down there, I come right back.
- "I, I, I, I, I!"
I wonder what the group would have to say about that.
No.
We are not even married, but I go.
The group thinks we' re married.
I accepted the potato slicer for our anniversary.
Right, sweets?
That' s it.
You...
You don' t want to get married.
And this is the way you deal with it!
- Oh, God.
You' re missing the grand design here!
If I don' t go, I' m dead.
And it' s difficult to have a relationship if I' m stuffed with formaldehyde.
- Now, if anyone is being selfish...
Now you blame- shift?
I' m calling a time- out!
Ah!
All right...
Jerry, I want you to acknowledge... that my needs mean nothing to you and you' re selfish.
- Jerry, acknowledge.
I...
I will acknowledge that I promised I would go to Vegas with you.
But now we' re just slightly delayed.
If you want to construe my wanting to stay alive as being selfish, OK.
Your needs are important to me.
Come on.
Look at all my stuff here, all over the pavement.
Come on, baby.
What do you say?
I' m going with or without you, Jerry.
What' s it gonna be?
- A bastard.
All those things you called me last night?
The only thing I' m interested in calling you is a cab!
- (Speaking Spanish) - What?
All set, Mr Welbach.
If you go to the front, a shuttle will take you to your car.
- What kind of car is it?
- It' s a Chrysler.
Is there a problem, Mr Welbach?
You know, it' s my first trip to Mexico and... a Chrysler?
I mean, I drive a Chrysler in America.
I thought you might have something more authentic, a little more...
- Mexican?
- You know, get into the spirit?
- Your first time?
Wow.
(In Spanish) Do you speak Spanish, Mr Welbach?
Huh?
Just what you learned on Speedy Gonzales?
Yeah, Speedy Gonzales.
Let' s see what we can do for you.
Oh, I think I have just the thing.
How would you like... an El Camino?!
I like that.
(In Spanish) You' re going to get into a lot of trouble here, sir.
Raoul!
(In Spanish) Who wants him, a two dayer?
He looks like a lead foot and a brake rider.
At the count of three.
El Camino!
Fucker.
You are in the wrong place, America.
Yeah, I' m aware of that.
What you want here?
Uh... tequila.
I asked because no one like you... comes to this place.
It' s death, this town.
Only farmers... and bandidos.
And I don' t see a hoe.
You a bandido, America?
Uh, no.
Uh, actually I' m looking for a Senor Beck.
Senor Beck?
Right.
- (Men jeer)
- I know who you are.
That makes things easier.
- We cool??
- You' re all the same.
This ain' t America.
You want a drink?
- Yeah, all right.
- Sit down.
Somebody using this chair?
I guess you wanna see it, right?
- You want to see it, don' t you?
I' m afraid I' m gonna have to.
You know what?
Come with me.
Sorry.
This is what they call The Mexican.
Yeah, that' s pretty.
"Yeah, it' s pretty."
- Uh- huh.
It was made for a rich landowner, a nobleman, by a poor Mexican gunsmith.
He fashioned this gun as a gift to go along with the hopes that the nobleman' s son would take his daughter' s hand in marriage.
'to catch the first glimpse of the pistol.
'Finally, the day had come.
'No one had ever laid eyes on a more beautiful gun.
'Some even thought it was too beautiful to look at.
'It was considered to be an honour and good luck
'to be the first to fire a newly- fashioned gun.
'Especially one as beautiful as this, made for the hand of a nobleman.
'The townsman was in a trance at the gun' s flawless craftsmanship.
'It backfired...
Legend has it that it' s been cursed ever since.
But it hasn' t harmed me any though, you know?
I love to look at it.
(Let me show you something.
Look, there' s a bullet in there.)
(It' s handmade.
Hand- fucking- made.)
You don' t even want to know what this gun is worth.
We could sell that gun, man.
It' s a great fucking gun.
And I' m not just talking shit either.
I' ve been pissin 'on myself.
Anyway, the old man is nothing to be afraid of.
As a matter of fact, last week I told him to fuck off.
- That' s what I said too!
I said, "Fuck off, Margolese, you old prune shit- ass!
Get up.
Man, you' re soaked in your own urine.
Don' t make me carry you.
Ah, this is my life.
All right.
Yeah, baby.
Buddy, you whacked your noggin!
Hey, man.
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit!
Stop!
Christ!
I found the gun.
'The gun is in your possession?'
But, like I said, there' s, uh...
There' s a problem.
What?
You lost the kid?
He' s a souse, he' il be in another bar.
The kid' s dead, Ted.
Ted, are you hearing me?
I- I heard you.
How?
Bad luck, act of God, fuck if I know.
All these maniacs shooting guns up into the sky.
It' s Independence Day or something.
The kid got tagged by a loose one.
Right in the fuckin 'head.
He' s dead!
The little fucker' s in my car right now, dead.
Geez, Jerry, that' s not a little problem.
- 'That' s a big problem.'
Jerry, that little fucker is Margolese' s grandson.
What?
'Geez, you really fucked it this time.'
What did I have to do with it?
One minute he' s pissin ', next he' s dead.
'Don' t even move.'
I' il phone the office now.
I' il get me on a plane and straighten shit out.
Ted, you gotta get word to the old man.
Just sit tight, Jerry.
- Ted?
Ted?
Wait!
Oh, no!
Excuse me, Bernie.
There is an issue.
It' s that fuckin 'Welbach.
# You' ve been a- messin 'where you shouldn' t been a- messin' (PA) # And now someone else is gettin 'all your best
# One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you... #
# Now what' s right is right but you ain' t been right yet... #
I don' t stand for any motherfuckin 'shit.
No shit at all.
This is what you' re gonna do.
You' re gonna stop crying.
And you' re gonna walk out of here with me.
- Mmm.
- Good.
(Sit down.) #.. and what he knows you ain' t got time to learn
Now, Sam, as I was saying...
No, please!
Please don' t hurt me!
Help me!
Please!
- Where' s your car?
- Where' s your fucking car?
- Are you hurt?
- No.
Yes.
I don' t know.
Truck, truck, truck!
Um, um...
- Can you stop the car?
Please.
- I' m gonna be sick.
I said, "It' il be fine, Mom.
- I' m dead.
- Well, you' re not dead.
You would have been dead if I hadn' t saved your life.
Would you rather it was you back there?
I didn' t think so.
Are you gonna kill me?
Depends on too many variables to answer.
Are you gonna rape me?
That' s not likely, no.
Well, what do you want?
I suspect the same thing as the other guy.
The pistol.
The one that Jerry' s havin 'a hard time coming back from Mexico with.
I work for Bernie Nayman, who works for Arnold Margolese.
- You heard of these people.
- And your husband works for 'em.
Well, he does.
He isn' t my husband.
Well, whatever he is to you, Jerry is in the shit books.
When you' re in as much shit as he is, you get skittish about your future.
Clouds your judgement.
There' s a lot of people interested in that gun.
"he who controls the girl, controls the pistol" situation.
I' m a hostage?
You blew that guy to pieces for a fucking gun?
Look...
Sit down.
Look.
Jerry and I broke up, so if he' s doing...
It' s got nothing to do with me.
You seem like a very nice girl.
Thank you.
But it' s a fact, in these life- threatening situations, human beings... lie.
So you are gonna kill me.
All right, look.
I don' t think that' il happen.
He gives me the pistol, I give you to him.
I' m just here to regulate funkiness.
Great.
Just you and me.
Go!
You' re such an ass.
What are you...?
No, no, no!
Fuck!
Fuck!
-? Que pasa?
- Buenas noches.
- Buenas noches.
- I need a lift to the next town.
I need a ride in your automobile to the next town.
I can' t pay you.
I have no money.
No dinero.
- De Niro?
- Si.
Robert De Niro?
Uh, I need a lift in your el truck- o to the next town- o.
- Uh, village- o.
Uh, uh, pueblo.
- Ah, pueblo.
- Yeah, si!
- Al otro pueblo.
- Senor De Niro!
Self- winding.
It' s very fine.
Shake like...
It' s good.
Is this even gonna run?
That your ball??
Shit.
You got a rabid dog back here.
Go!
Out.
You gotta do something about this dog.
(Operator) 'I have a collect call for Samantha from Jerry Welbach.
- 'No one there, sir.'
- (Jerry) 'Give it a second.'
Sam, pick up the phone.
Samsonite?
Baby, please don' t do this.
- 'Please try again, sir' - No!
Just give it a second.
What are you doing?
- You' re gonna make a call.
- To whom?
To Jerry.
You' re gonna tell him that Leroy is with you then you hang up.
- Leroy?
Leroy, that' s right.
Then you' re gonna hang up.
That' s it?
It' s enough.
You gonna make the call or do I have to make you?
I' il call.
- Good.
Dial it.
OK.
You have the number.
You should have the number.
What are you tellin 'me?
You don' t have a number, a motel, nothing?
What' s the matter, don' t you listen?
No longer together.
Why would I have the number?
I' m sensing you have trust issues.
You got one minute.
I' m a professional.
I do this for a living.
Goody for you.
You' re wasting your time.
I think I believe you.
What' s in Vegas?
Uh, well... I' m gonna be a waitress, then make a career as a croupier.
They can make $100, 000 a year but you have to have the hands, which I do.
I got them from Grandma Vega, which is a good thing cos my Granny Barzel had hands like a circus midget.
How come you can' t live with Jerry?
Do you know Jerry?
He has trouble expressing feelings.
He had a fucked- up childhood.
One of those people who thinks the iron is always on.
- Don' t you love him?
- I think that' s the problem.
We love each other too much.
He' s so selfish.
It' s like we' ve been living his life forever.
He' d tell you a different story, but I give and he just keeps taking.
Our counsellor totally agrees with me, by the way.
I don' t put much stock in those counsellor types.
All they do is sit around and smoke joints.
Maybe, but Jerry is still a taker and I' m a giver.
It' s obvious.
A lot of people are under the impression that you get to choose who you love.
Are you taking his side?
You' re a man, of course.
- You' re taking his side.
- You love him.
You said so yourself.
It' s all that matters.
You' re a very sensitive person for a killer.
Thank you, Sam.
Shit.
Get.
Look, you gotta get out.
Get out!
Go!
Hola, shithead!
Where' s my stuff?
Where' s my stuff?
- Pistol.
Pistolero.
- La pistola.
Get back!
Get back, get back!
Don' t move.
What the f...?
Back!
Back, back.
Get in the car.
Is that my...?
Put it in the car!
What is wrong with you people?
- (Sam) You don' t have to be in here.
- I go by track record.
- I don' t hear any tinkle, tinkle.
- Stage fright.
Look around, there' s not even a window.
So what' s with this "We' ve been livin 'his life forever" thing?
I didn' t mean it literally.
Jerry' s been working for Margolese for five years less a day.
It just feels lifelong.
- Sounds like jail terms.
- It is.
Arnold Margolese is in jail because Jerry put him there.
Jerry ratted out Arnold Margolese?
Jerry was coming across Ventura, over there by Laurel Canyon.
- He wasn' t paying attention, ran a red light, smashed into Margolese' s Cadillac.
When the cops came, Margolese got busted cos he had a person in the trunk.
That' s how Margolese got sent to jail??
- Live person or dead person?
- Live person.
What' s the big deal, then?
He probably wasn' t gonna stay that way.
He was taped up in a trunk for a reason, wasn' t he?
I would think this was right up your alley, Swifty.
- He saw something?
- Whatever it was this guy saw, or was going to say to the cops, he got the chance.
Since it was Jerry' s fault, Margolese had him work off the jail time.
My whole relationship has been hijacked because he doesn' t pay attention when he drives.
I can' t go with you in here.
(Man) We didn' t think we were getting a dead man with the car.
I got no use for a dead gringo.
Come on.
If you' re going to kill me, at least tell me who it is that' s going to send me to God.
Tell me!
Look, I' m not gonna kill you.
But I am gonna have to shoot you.
But why, sir?
Because you stole from me, you know about the pistol and you' il steal again.
I can' t have you coming back like a fly in the ointment.
You' il never see me again.
You' re gettin 'shot, that' s it.
It' il take time to walk to town, especially limping...
Wait, wait.
Can' t you just tie me up some more?
You shoot me?
I don' t have a rope.
So you shoot me?
It' s the American way.
OK.
There' s arteries.
I could bleed to death in seconds.
The foot.
That' s fair where I come from.
It' il hurt, but it' il heal.
What if you take off a fucking toe!
Wait, wait, wait.
Not the left.
On the count of three.
- (Screams)
But there' s a few ways to look at it.
Sex is, no matter what anybody says, a very important part of any relationship.
The fact that Jerry is a considerate lover says a lot.
- You lost me.
- Well, he' s a considerate lover.
You gotta find a way to get him to expand this quality he has during sex to other areas of your relationship.
Even if it only comes out in sex, it' s there just the same.
That' s a good point.
If a person' s a considerate lover, he can' t be all selfish, right?
Unless of course he' s...
- He' s, uh, being a considerate...
- What was that?
What?
That moment you had.
What moment?
Leroy, you just checked out that guy and had a moment.
That was a moment.
I don' t know if it was a moment.
(Are you gay?)
- As in happy?
- As in homosexual.
What does my sexual orientation have to do with our conversation?
Nothing.
Except something that you said back there really bugged me and this would kind of help it make sense.
Yeah?
What' s that?
I asked if you were gonna rape me, you said, "Not likely."
You said it so coldly, like I was repulsive and it was ludicrous to think I was actually at risk of being raped.
First of all, it' s a crime of anger, not attraction.
Second of all, you' re not repulsive.
You' re very beautiful.
Thank you.
- You want me to rape you?
- Are you gay?
- You want me to rape you?
- You' re gay.
You' re gay.
I knew it!
What a relief.
Do you want a medal??
A little trinket saying you identified a homosexual??
Are you full throttle?
Full throttle?
Yeah, I guess I am.
I mean...
I' m not trying to be a smart- ass or anything like that.
I think this is great.
This is... major, OK?
I... know the kind of people in your business, OK?
- Yeah?
- And to me, it seems that...
Well, being gay isn' t really... conducive to the environment.
Like I should be an interior decorator.
That' s insulting.
- I am very good at what I do.
- Do you have a boyfriend?
No, I don' t.
Unfortunately, I seem to be unable to keep... relationships together.
Seems like everybody' s having trouble keeping relationships together.
It' s ringing, senor.
- Thank you for that.
No necesario.
Really?
That' s so kind.
You have no idea what...
'Hi, this is Ted.
Leave a message.
'If this is my guy in need, I' m on my way.
Sit tight. '
Forget aeropuerto.
Uh, Hotel de la Plaza.
- (Muttering in Spanish) - Hola.
- Sort of.
Came along for the ride.
He has a personality and that does count.
- He' s a good guy.
- Is this your car?
It' s a rental.
I' m an American.
- No shit?
Really?
I' m Mexican.
Cool.
Do you have a passport?
- Jerry Wellbatch, Los Angeles, USA.
- Welbach...
Wellbatch.
Can I ask you a question, Jerry?
How long have you been in Mexico?
Pleasure.
- I see.
- Pleasure, huh?
Can you tell me, uh, what happened here?
That' s not accurate, I' m afraid.
The gunsmith did craft this pistol for a prospective husband, and he was a nobleman' s son, true.
But the motif was darker, my friend.
It' s cursed, this gun.
(Policeman) 'The key to this tale involves the gunsmith' s assistant,' a poor, but honourable young man in blinding love
'gathering the precious metal
'only to discover that what he hoped could be a wedding gift for him...' was for another.
'forbidding their love.
'vowing the creation would never prevail.
'But the gunsmith was racing against time.
'the nobleman' s dowry hanging in the balance.
'He worked day and night to correct the pistol' s problems.'
This gun never worked properly.
Some say its very creation ended the gunsmith' s life.
Well, my friend, you' re free to go, but without the gun.
This gun doesn' t belong to you or to your boss.
Now it belongs to me.
It can be tough that way.
(Sam) Expensive?
(Man) Yeah, emotionally.
I had a serious relationship problem.
Well, you fit right in here.
- What do you do now, Frank?
- Now... I am a postman.
Get out of here.
There' s a seedy underbelly to the postal service.
- That' s the key.
You have no idea how many small, unmarked brown paper packages I deliver.
- What, porno?
- Yeah, daily.
Like what?
Videos, blow- up dolls, dildos, pocket pussies.
- Don' t leave nothing out.
I still have to take off once a year.
I just get up and I know I' m going to Vegas, I just don' t know how.
All I' ve got is my wallet and an attitude.
I don' t know, it keeps me sane.
After all, guns don' t kill people... postal workers do.
OK, you' re all set, Mr Shurker.
If you go to the front, a shuttle will pick you up.
What kind of car is it exactly?
It' s a Chrysler, sir, brand- new.
You wouldn' t happen to have something a little more...
Never fear, Teddy' s here.
How are you?
The Mexican thief, the dirty cop?
The word is out.
It' s a big- ticket item.
A lot of fucking people are interested in that gun.
That I' m selling them out?
Maybe they think you' re scared and might do the wrong thing.
- You know, I don' t know.
- I' m just doing my portion here.
- Yeah, and what is that?
To find out what' s going on, assess the damage, try to calm you down, help find the pistol, get us home.
I get on that plane, pistol or not. it' il be the last flight I ever take.
- Oh, come on, Jerry.
You know it.
- I know what I have to know.
- Doing your part.
I know what I have to know.
You sound like Schultz from Hogan' s Heroes.
(German accent) I know nothing!
I don' t like Nayman running things either.
look straight ahead and do what you' re told.
That' s why I nearly paid off Boca Raton.
I do my fuckin 'portions.
I don' t care how you look at it, the first step out of this is to get the pistol back.
I never took a pay- off in my life.
Jerry, look, I know where your loyalties lie.
The pistol' s gone.
Come on.
You' re my guy.
- (Music stops) - Not the safest dance!
I' m not going anywhere.
(Sam) We are in the city where I' m going to be living.
(Go.)
Go.
What' s wrong?
You know when you' re in a bad relationship and you separate?
All of a sudden, everywhere you look there' s love and possibility.
I' m worried about Jerry.
All right, don' t worry.
I' il call Nayman and check in on everything.
You want me to stay?
I want you to go.
You sure?
I really want you to go.
(Ted) I couldn' t sleep all night.
No, he said he followed the cop to the pawn shop.
He' s taking me over there after breakfast.
We' re booked on the seven o' clock if all goes well.
No, now wait...
No, you wait a minute, Nayman.
Now what do you gotta go and say that for?
Well, now or later?
How could I misinterpret?
No, you didn' t send the wrong guy.
I' m handling things.
But I never signed up for that.
Listen, I promise you, when I tell him, it' il make a difference.
Bye.
I keep calling and I haven' t heard a word from you.
I' m starting to wonder.
OK?
I think she actually went to Vegas.
I keep telling you, these women are problems, you know?
You should try to be like me - I answer to myself.
No hassles, nobody ridin 'my ass like a goddamn horse in a saddle.
You close yourself off so you have no shot at meeting the right woman.
Any woman can be the right woman if the numbers work.
No way.
You open yourself up.
What' s the insight into my relationship?
OK, look, Jerry.
She is in Vegas.
What?
Hey, shit falls down, you know?
Shit falls down?
Margolese called Nayman all pissed off cos you were fucking this up, told him to keep an eye on Sam in case...
In case I get any funny ideas.
You' re just telling me this now?
- There' s other things to consider.
That gun' s worth a lot.
Sam could be in danger.
No shit.
Who did they put on her?
You don' t know him, but you know of him.
- That fucking psycho Leroy.
It was an order.
Margolese would know if he didn' t.
They' re just trying to scare me.
Well, that would sure do it for me.
We' ve all heard the kidney story, Jerry.
Nayman wants us on that seven o' clock flight, pistol in tow.
They' il meet us at the airport and then Leroy will take the pistol.
I had to borrow...
Do you mind?
Sleep well??!
Yeah.
You?
Who' s Winston?
Somebody I don' t like very much.
You can have that removed, you know?
Yeah, maybe I will someday.
You wanna get some breakfast?
At first, I thought this guy is all right.
And then I' m thinking he' s more than all right, he' s terrific.
But there' s no way he' s gonna feel the same way about me.
Then I find out he does.
Then I' m thinking... what happens when he finds out what I do... and who I am and what I' ve done?
Let' s get serious.
What are you gonna do about it?
I didn' t have to do anything.
It happened absent of my will to consciously make it happen.
Oh, really?
I was a little drunk last night.
I took my gun and I put it in the towels in the bathroom, you know?
And he found it.
And he said, "The past doesn' t matter.
"It' s the future that counts."
See, life can change.
People can change.
I haven' t cried in 12 years.
What are you lookin 'at?
Don' t look at me like that.
You' re makin 'it worse.
What are you, Barbara Walters?
It' s just beautiful.
Let' s talk about somethin 'else.
- What do you wanna talk about?
- Anything.
Whatever.
What was it over, the last time you cried?
Let' s talk about that.
Oh, yeah, that' il bring the sun right out (!)
(Ted) I heard it was this guy Leroy' s mother.
OK, that' s what we call bullshit.
If I told one guy at the next convention that you kept your mother cut up in the freezer, you' d have a reputation too.
Fact or not, it makes no difference.
- Oh, my God.
Why are you so worried then if you think it' s bullshit?
It was for all of two seconds.
I shook his hand.
He seemed like a nice guy.
Whether or not he lives up to his legend isn' t the point.
Or if he sits in his garage soaked in gasoline lighting matches,
I don' t care.
What concerns me is he was hired in the first place.
- Are you with me?
- Geez, Jerry, you really met him?
Oh, my God!
I' m here.
Thanks, Ted.
I feel real safe.
- Hola.
- I no fuck around, comprende?
Gun, gun, loaded.
You, dead.
Do you have a speech impediment?
- Give me the gun.
The pistol.
- The pistol??
You know what I' m talkin 'about.
- The pistol??
- OK, what' s your name?
Joe.
Joe, do what he says and we' il be out of here before you know it.
- The pistol, please.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Go.
Got it.
Just have a seat right here, amigo.
Have you lost your mind?
What were you talking about on the phone?
Put the gun away.
Is that what you two were discussing?
- Jerry, I would never...
Go ahead.
- OK, OK.
Jerry, that' s what he said.
So you were lying when you said I' d walk away from this?
- No, Jerry, that' s what he said.
- Then you' re lying to me now.
Nayman told me to do it, Jerry, but...
- But...
But you' re just doing your portion.
Isn' t that how it works?
Boca Raton, right?
I wouldn' t do that.
Come on, I swear!
They tell you to bring me in, then they tell you to take me out.
Why are you being told two contradicting things?
- I- I just...
I don' t know.
- Yeah, it' s...
It' s weird.
Because something' s going on.
What is it?
Exactly.
You don' t know, you' re just doing your fucking part.
Well, I' m not going down because you don' t know!
You see my predicament?
You' re my guy, Ted.
You' re my guy, Jerry.
What happened here?
Swan- dived off the balcony.
Let' s go.
Walk on.
Thank you very much.
Sorry to have disturbed you.
(Man) Hotel security.
Please, no.
No.
No.
(Leroy) Coming.
Sir, there' s been a terrible incident.
Are all parties in your room accounted for?
Yeah.
Just me and my wife.
No, that' s OK, sir.
Thank you.
- What happened?
- Sorry to disturb you.
Everything all right?
Leroy...
Pack your shit.
You' re a stupid motherfucker, you know that?
You' re well dressed, I' il give you that, but stupid.
Wear Kevlar?
Yeah.
Please don' t do this.
You think I should listen to her?
What do you think?
Wanna know what I think?
Kevlar is for pussies.
This is for Frank.
- My bag will make the flight?
- They' il run it down.
- Yeah.
- I' m afraid there' s been a mistake.
- What?
Mr Shurker most probably has yours.
(Leroy) I told you, if Jerry makes it and nothing gets funky, it' il be OK.
- Well, shit got funky.
Why?
Why?
Give me a second, I' m trying to get the story here.
Take it easy and stop acting like a kidnapped chick on a carton of milk.
This is an offer for the gun.
I' ve just been trying to get some better numbers together.
You have no intention of giving the gun to Margolese.
Look, Bobby.
You know, I know that you' re loyal.
I mean, nobody' s debating that.
Let me ask you, in your skulking around, going through private things in people' s offices, did you discover that he' s shutting us down?
You, me, everybody.
I don' t understand.
What, you didn' t get the memo, the bonus?
Nothing.
Me neither.
Difference is I know when I' m being fucked and you don' t, cos you' re standing on the wrong fucking line.
Let me help you get on the right side of the line and do for you what he should' ve done, Bobby.
He' s changed in prison.
I' m telling you, something' s changed him.
- He' s not the same guy.
They' re still holding.
What shall I tell 'em?
Can I count on your co- operation?
Yeah.
Yeah, that' s his hotel.
Yeah, all right.
- What?
- Plan B is now in effect.
I hope you don' t get airsick.
Get in the car.
- Hola, senor.
- Hola, Senor Welbach.
Has the US Consulate called back yet?
No, sir, not yet.
Look, this is a muy, muy important call.
I' ve lost my passport, OK?
I' m not gonna move.
Do you see that man over there?
- That' s Mr Williamson.
- So?
He' s been waiting for that very same call.
Really?
What, the whole morning?
- Since March, senor.
- Oh, come on!
Hotel de la Plaza.
Yes, as a matter of fact, he' s right here.
Senor, it' s for you.
Hey.
You bastard.
Hello?
Everything is fine. "
- Sam?
- 'I thought you could be dead.'
like you' re confirming a room service order?!
Mr "Hi".
- (Leroy) 'Ask about the gun.'
- Is that Leroy?
- Do you have any idea what I have just been through?
Multiply it by 1, 000 and you' il have a vague conception of where I' m at.
Oh, isn' t that typical, Jerry?
It' s all a competition!
- Tit for tat, tat for tit...
- Stop yelling, for Christ' s sake!
Are you all right?
- 'Where are you?'
- Toluca airport, Jerry.
And things are shitty, really shitty!
Tell him if he shows up with the pistol, it' il be OK.
He only cares about himself. '
Why are you airing personal matters with strangers?
Oh, let me see.
Uh, I don' t think that you really classify someone who you just perpetrated a killing with a fucking stranger!
And I can' t find my Kotex cards or my credit cards...
Sam, what did you say?
Jerry, just settle down.
What' d you do to her?
- Jerry, just settle down.
- Yeah.
We had a situation but I' m a professional and I know what I' m doing.
So why don' t we chill out a minute here?
- 'Now, what happened?
- Yeah, five years ago.
- What did you...?
I can' t hear you.
Nothing.
Yeah, you just...
- Huh?
I understand. '
We' il square things away. '
You got a very special woman here.
But we all know how you can get, right?
- 'So none of that.'
This is a time for selflessness.
Wha...?
- Yeah, come on.
Stupid gun.
Out!
(Leroy) I have to ask you a question.
And it' s an important one so I want you to think about the answer before you give it to me, OK?
When two people really love each other but they can' t get it together, when do you get to that point where enough is enough?
You know?
Um, you know it' s over when...
OK, I have, like, these psychosomatic insomniatic manifestations of...
Well, here' s the thing about me.
I' m a product of my emotions, not a product of my environment, like him, which he is, exactly, just that environmental...
I- I need sunshine to grow.
That' s who I am.
And with the projection of...
I have goals.
- That' s your answer?
- Yeah.
That' s not right.
I mean, there' s a right answer here, but that' s not it.
Look, in my business you' re surrounded... by loneliness and finality.
I don' t care what your take is on an afterlife, when people die, it' s scary, and they go alone.
Now, the people that I send off, that have experienced love...
They' re a little less scared.
They' re still scared, but there' s a calmness to 'em.
I think that comes from the knowledge that somebody somewhere loved 'em and cared for' em and will miss' em.
Now, I see that from time to time and I am awed by it.
I don' t think I' d be telling you this if it wasn' t for Frank.
Anyway, it' s a loaded question.
Look, when two people love each other, totally, truthfully, all the way love each other, the answer to that question is simple, especially in your case.
Never.
Never.
I just hope Jerry' s not stupid.
What is he driving?!
It' s a funky rental.
I know we' re all a little grouchy right now.
We' il get something to eat, you' il get the pistol and then we' il go our separate ways.
- Really separate ways.
- Don' t start.
Shut up.
I' il start because I have the...
Why do you do that?
Do not tell me to shut up.
- We had an agreement.
- Shut up.
- Why don' t we all shut up a bit?
- I swear, I will crash this car.
- Jerry, don' t do that.
I will.
One more word.
I swear to fucking God.
Naugahyde.
- All right.
- Jerry!
- You finished?
- Yes!
- Yes, yes, yes!
Jerry, I will, I will!
Stop the car.
Oh, my God!
Jerry... I want you to know, you' re the craziest fuck I ever met.
Go to Vegas.
I' ve had it!
Son of a bitch!
I had a flat down in Florida once.
Out in the middle of nowhere.
So I go to the trunk, there' s no spare.
Four hours in the baking sun, waiting for a truck to come by.
Now I always check.
Let me give it a rip.
Sometimes you need a little more torque, you know what I mean?
Wouldn' t kill the bastards to oil these every once in a while.
Fucking car rentals.
Yeah.
- Walk away, baby.
- What did you do?
He was gonna kill us.
Look at his head!
Stop!
I met Leroy in 1997.
- And that' s not him!
You made a terrible mistake.
He was my friend!
You made a terrible mistake!
- OK?
- No.
- Yes!
He' s black.
A person of colour.
That' s Margolese' s Leroy.
So, this guy...
Oh, I' m such an ass.
Of course.
He' il get it down to Margolese. "Ha fuckin 'ha!
You see?
I' m being set up!
Nayman hires this prick to take out Leroy, get the gun and pin it all on Jack- off Jerry.
Isn' t that right, Mr Winston Baldry?
I met Leroy and there' s no way you could have known that.
You fucked up.
I can' t believe it.
Every fucking time.
Every fucking time, I fuck up.
This time, I win.
This time, I win!
Oh, my God.
I' m lucky I didn' t lose you three days ago.
I wanna go home.
Did you call the consulate?
Yeah.
Do you have enough money?
Yeah, I' m all right.
I wanna ask you a question.
It' s a good one, so think about it.
If two people love each other... but they just can' t seem to get it together...
when do you get to that point of enough is enough?
Never.
They' il call.
I said it was an emergency.
Why would Nayman ask you if you like sex and travel??
W- w- what is it supposed to mean?
Is that...
I tell you the whole, long debacle and this you have a problem with?
I think that when you ask someone who is involved in a relationship of the heart if they like sex and travel, that... that' s m- m- mean- spirited.
It' s stupid.
I' il tell you this, we' re not running any more, no.
The packing and the running and...
Sooner or later, that phone is gonna ring.
We are going to get your passport in order and you are gonna give the gun to Margolese.
Nayman is fucking Margolese.
That has nothing to do with us.
By the grace of God, I don' t know what, you have managed to Forrest Gump your way through this.
And just, if we run now... we' re gonna be running the rest of our lives.
We want our life back.
Yes, baby, we do.
(Jerry) No, that can' t be right.
Can you just check again?
Baby, don' t.
Margolese.
M as in Mary.
Baby, can you turn that down?
You don' t even speak Spanish.
Real emotion transcends language, Jerry.
You don' t have to understand to hear their pain.
That' s...
Do you know when?
Ay- yi- yi!
All right.
He' s out.
He' s not due out till Thursday.
It is Thursday, hon.
- What is it?
Come on.
Just stay away from the window.
Shit.
Here, give me it.
Good one.
What is it, boy?
Get out of there.
You' re freaking me out.
Where are you taking me?
It' s not your fault you know nothing about this gun.
You' re American.
This gun does not belong to you.
Mr Margolese.
I don' t understand.
What' s it gonna take, Jerry?
What?
For the gun, Jerry.
What' s it gonna take for you to give it to me and not to another?
Man!
What' il it take?
I don' t know what it takes.
I' m new in the "fuck you" business.
- You tell me, what does it take?
- I didn' t fuck you, Jerry.
I had Nayman send you down here, but I didn' t know he was looking for a buyer.
When I found out he was, I didn' t know who on my team was... still on my team, or even if there was a damn team.
Who the fuck are these guys?
They work for this man, Tropillo.
And who the fuck is Trop...?
Not important.
Give me a good reason why I shouldn' t fight to not give you the gun.
If it comes to that, someone will leave here missing an ear or not being able to fuck any more.
One reason, now that you let me know what you think I' m made of.
Are you a fatalist, Jerry?
Uh, I never really thought about it.
Por favor...
Gracias.
When you do think about it, about that afternoon you smashed into my life, into my car, ever think there' s anything to that?
I honestly never thought about it.
I' m doomed to remember a backwards inmate with a paper clipping.
When you' re in jail, a small box... you learn a lot about the fella you' re in a cage with.
I grew to love that boy, like he was my own son.
One day the boy came to me with a clipping.
"This is my destiny.
This is my birthright. "
It was a story about the pistol... how they found it in the mines, stashed away.
When I asked why it meant so much to him, the story he told changed my life.
'the assistant could not sleep... his heart in aching pain.'
'his gift to the nobleman.
'The nobleman' s son was a notoriously vicious soldier,
'more perfect than he' d ever laid eyes on before.
'or have prepared him for that gun' s flawless grace.
'it was love at first sight.
'A perfect fit.'
- (Click) - 'It did not work.
'The nobleman took it as a bad omen.
'The curse had rendered it useless in unworthy hands.
'The gunsmith urged him to try it one last time, and so he did.'
'The nobleman was insulted by the ineptness, angry with the gunsmith.
'They argued.
'a man far less than he, he was furious in anger.
'He could not have that.
'and accept their fate.'
'Some say you could actually hear her heart break.
'She fearlessly surrendered her bitter spirit unto purgatory.'
'The pistol contains her damned soul.'
Day after day I listened to that story and always he' d tell me,
"When I get out, I will find that pistol and return it to my father,
"whose father' s father had crafted the gun."
Eighteen months later, he took it in the belly for me.
He died.
I vowed to search, acquire the pistol and return it to his father.
My grandson, Beck, headstrong boy...
Sure, he was mixed up, he didn' t understand the honour behind what I was doing.
That' s when it became clear I had to send you down here.
Because you were the instrument in the situation, Jerry.
His son is dead.
My grandson is dead.
All of it brought together by that afternoon at our intersection.
Well, that... that' s a pretty good fucking reason.
You are a soldier of God.
She will be safe there, right there, and she can fly with the angels.
No devils can catch her here, right here, and now she will be able to fly with the angels.
We square?
I' il owe you.
Jerry, honey?
'I bet this is the queen of the idiot?
'This must be Sam.
This is Bernie Nayman.
'Where' s that stupid fucking Jerry?
With Leroy? '
Don' t you mean Winston?
I hope not, cos he' s dead.
'Then you' re in a lot of trouble.
'Especially if Jerry sold that gun.'
- Jerry hid it.
- 'A step in the right direction.
'Are you there, Sam?'
Yeah, I' m here.
Yeah, me too.
(Jerry) Nayman!
What have you done with her?
Don' t shoot.
She' s in the trunk.
- I swear, if you hurt...
- It is hot in there.
- Let her out!
- Give me the pistol and I will.
All right.
All right, Nayman, where are the keys?
I might have lost them.
Well, you' re out of luck.
She' s the one who hid the pistol.
Sam, no!
You' il damage it.
- Shut the fuck up!
No.
I will pull this fucking trigger.
You toast that gun, he' s dead right after.
Sweets.
OK?
Put it down.
I' m not worth it.
He' s right, it' s not worth it.
Don' t you know when enough is enough?
Baby.
Do you like sex and travel??
As a matter of fact, I do.
Wrong answer.
Sweetheart?
We just witnessed a miracle.
Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.
- Are you OK?
Am I OK?
You OK?
- May I?
- It would be our honour.
Seal it.
Do you love me, Jerry?
I adore you, sweetheart.
Then tell me it again.
- Just one more time.
Please.
The pistol was crafted for a noble man by a poor Mexican gunsmith.
- It' s nobleman.
- What did I say?
What difference does it make?
- It doesn' t.
- Why correct me?
- English is your mother tongue.
- I' m calling a time- out!
(Sam) I love you, Jerry.
{y: i} Once upon a time {y: i} in a kingdom far, far away, {y: i} the king and queen were blessed {y: i} with a beautiful baby girl.
{y: i} And throughout the land, {y: i} everyone was happy... {y: i} until the sun went down {y: i} and they saw that their daughter was {y: i} cursed with a frightful enchantment {y: i} that took hold each and every night.
{y: i} Desperate, they sought the help {y: i} of a fairy godmother {y: i} who had them lock the young princess {y: i} away in a tower, {y: i} there to await the kiss... {y: i} of the handsome Prince Charming.
{y: i} It was he who would chance {y: i} the perilous journey {y: i} through blistering cold {y: i} and scorching desert {y: i} traveling for many days and nights, {y: i} risking life and limb {y: i} to reach the Dragon' s keep.
For he was the bravest, and most handsome... in all the land.
And it was destiny that his kiss would break the dreaded curse.
He alone would climb to the highest room of the tallest tower to enter the princess' s chambers, cross the room to her sleeping silhouette, pull back the gossamer curtains to find her...
What?
Fiona?
- No!
Oh, thank heavens.
Where is she?
- She' s on her honeymoon.
- Honeymoon?
With whom?
# Can' t stop thinking 'bout it
# Well, I didn' t mean to do it
It' s so good to be home!
Just you and me and...
Shrek!
Fiona!
Aren' t you two a sight for sore eyes!
Give us a hug, Shrek, you old love machine.
And look at you, Mrs. Shrek.
How 'bout a side of sugar for the steed?
Donkey, what are you doing here?
Taking care of your love nest for you.
Oh, you mean like... sorting the mail and watering the plants?
- Yeah, and feeding the fish!
You do now.
I call that one Shrek and the other Fiona.
That Shrek is a rascally devil.
Look at the time.
I guess you' d better be going.
Don' t you want to tell me about your trip?
Or how about a game of Parcheesi?
Shouldn' t you be getting home to Dragon?
Oh, yeah, that.
She' s been all moody and stuff lately.
I thought I' d move in with you.
You know we' re always happy to see you, Donkey.
But Fiona and I are married now.
We need a little time, you know, to be together.
Just with each other.
Say no more.
You don' t have to worry about a thing.
- Donkey!
- Yes, roomie?
You' re bothering me.
I guess...
Maybe I' il see y' all Sunday for a barbecue or something.
He' il be fine.
Now, where were we?
I think I remember.
- Donkey!
I know, I know!
Alone!
I' m going!
What do you want me to tell these other guys?
Enough, Reggie.
"Dearest Princess Fiona.
"at which time the King
"will bestow his royal blessing... upon you and your..." uh... "Prince Charming.
"Love, the King and Queen of Far, Far Away.
"Aka Mom and Dad."
Mom and Dad?
- Prince Charming?
- Royal ball?
Can I come?
- We' re not going.
- What?
I mean, don' t you think they might be a bit... shocked to see you like this?
Well, they might be a bit surprised.
But they' re my parents, Shrek.
They love me.
They' il love you, too.
Stop it.
They' re not like that.
Oh, come on!
You could at least give them a chance.
To do what?
No!
They just want to give you their blessing.
Now I need their blessing?
If you want to be a part of this family, yes!
Who says I want to be part of this family?
You did!
When you married me!
Well, there' s some fine print for you!
So that' s it.
You won' t come?
Trust me.
It' s a bad idea.
We are not going!
And that' s final!
We don' t want to hit traffic!
Don' t worry!
We' il take care of everything.
- Hey, wait for me.
Head 'em up!
Move 'em on!
# Ride 'em up!
Pound 'em dead!
Make 'em tea!
- Are we there yet?
- Are we there yet?
- OK, are we there yet?
- No.
- No!
- Are we there yet?
- Yes.
- No!
- Are we there yet?
- No!
- We are not!
- Are we there yet?
- Are we there yet?
- That' s not funny.
That' s really immature.
- This is why nobody likes ogres.
- Your loss!
- I' m gonna just stop talking.
- Finally!
There' s no in- flight movie or nothing!
The Kingdom of Far, Far Away, Donkey.
That' s where we' re going.
Far, far... away!
All right, all right, I get it.
I' m just so darn bored.
Well, find a way to entertain yourself.
For five minutes...
Could you not be yourself...... for five minutes!
Are we there yet?
- Yes!
- Oh, finally!
It' s going to be champagne wishes and caviar dreams from now on.
We' il be back to pick you up later!
# Gotta make a move to a town that' s right for me
We are definitely not in the swamp anymore.
Hey, ladies!
You working that hat.
Movie stars!
Announcing the long- awaited return of the beautiful Princess Fiona and her new husband.
Well, this is it.
This is it.
Uh... why don' t you guys go ahead?
I' il park the car.
So... you still think this was a good idea?
Look.
Mom and Dad look happy to see us.
- Who on earth are they?
- I think that' s our little girl.
That' s not little!
That' s a really big problem.
Wasn' t she supposed to kiss Prince Charming and break the spell?
Well, he' s no Prince Charming, but they do look...
Happy now?
We came.
We saw them.
Now let' s go before they light the torches.
- They' re my parents.
They locked you in a tower.
Good!
Here' s our chance.
Let' s go back inside and pretend we' re not home.
Harold, we have to be...
Quick!
While they' re not looking we can make a run for it.
Shrek, stop it!
Everything' s gonna be...
A disaster!
There is no way...
- You can do this.
- Really...
- don' t... want... to... be...
Mom...
Dad...
I' d like you to meet my husband...
Shrek.
Well, um...
It' s easy to see where Fiona gets her good looks from.
- Excuse me.
Better out than in, I always say, eh, Fiona?
Don' t tell me you don' t know who I am.
What do you mean, "not on the list"?
Don' t tell me you don' t know who I am.
What' s happening, everybody?
Thanks for waiting.
- I had the hardest time finding this place.
Bad donkey!
Bad!
It' s all right.
He' s with us.
- He helped rescue me from the dragon.
The noble steed.
How 'bout a bowl for the steed?
Oh, boy.
- Um, Shrek?
- Yeah?
Oh, sorry!
Mmm!
Darling.
So, Fiona, tell us about where you live.
Shrek owns his own land.
- Don' t you, honey?
- Oh, yes!
It' s in an enchanted forest abundant in squirrels and cute little duckies and...
What?
I know you ain' t talking about the swamp.
An ogre from a swamp.
How original.
I suppose that would be a fine place to raise the children.
It' s a bit early to be thinking about that, isn' t it?
I just started eating.
- Harold!
- What' s that supposed to mean?
It' s great, OK?
- For his type, yes.
I got to go to the bathroom.
- Dinner is served!
I can hold it.
Bon appetit!
Oh, Mexican food!
My favorite.
Let' s not sit here with our tummies rumbling.
Everybody dig in.
Don' t mind if I do, Lillian.
I suppose any grandchildren I could expect from you would be...
Ogres, yes!
Not that there' s anything wrong with that.
No!
That is, assuming you don' t eat your own young!
Dad!
No, we usually prefer the ones who' ve been locked away in a tower!
- Shrek, please!
- I only did that because I love her.
Aye, day care or dragon- guarded castle.
You wouldn' t understand.
It' s so nice to have the family together for dinner.
- Harold!
- Shrek!
- Fiona!
- Fiona!
- Mom!
- Harold...
Donkey!
# I know what every princess needs
Oh, my dear.
Oh, look at you.
You' re all grown up.
- Who are you?
- Oh, sweet pea!
I' m your fairy godmother.
- I have a fairy godmother?
Now, don' t worry.
I' m here to make it all better.
# With a flick of the wrist and just a flash You' il land a prince with a ton of cash
Stop!
Look...
Thank you very much, Fairy Godmother, but I really don' t need all this.
- Fiona?
Fiona?
You got a puppy?
All I got in my room was shampoo.
Fairy Godmother, furniture...
I' d like you to meet my husband, Shrek.
What?
What did you say?
When did this happen?
Shrek is the one who rescued me.
- But that can' t be right.
- Oh, great, more relatives!
She' s just trying to help.
Get your coat, dear.
We' re leaving.
- What?
- I don' t want to leave.
When did you decide this?
- Shortly after arriving.
- Look, I' m sorry...
No, that' s all right.
I need to go, anyway.
If you should ever need me... happiness... is just a teardrop away.
Thanks, but we' ve got all the happiness we need.
Happy, happy, happy...
So I see.
Let' s go, Kyle.
- What?
I told you coming here was a bad idea.
You could' ve at least tried to get along with my father.
I don' t think I was going to get Daddy' s blessing, even if I did want it.
Sure.
Do you want me to pack for you?
You' re unbelievable!
You' re behaving like a...
Say it!
- Like an ogre!
Here' s a news flash for you!
I am an ogre!
And guess what, Princess?
That' s not about to change.
I' ve made changes for you, Shrek.
Think about that.
"I' m an ogre!"
I knew this would happen.
You started it.
I can hardly believe that, Lillian.
Not me.
I think, Harold, you' re taking this a little too personally.
This is Fiona' s choice.
But she was supposed to choose the prince we picked for her.
I mean, you expect me to give my blessings to this... thing?
Fiona does.
And she' il never forgive you if you don' t.
I don' t want to lose our daughter again, Harold.
Oh, you act as if love is totally predictable.
We used to walk down by the lily pond and...
- they were in bloom...
- Our first kiss.
It' s not the same!
I don' t think you realize that our daughter has married a monster!
Fine!
Pretend there' s nothing wrong!
La, di, da, di, da!
Isn' t it all wonderful!
I' d like to know how it could get any worse!
- Hello, Harold.
- What happened?
Just the old crusade wound playing up a bit!
I' il just stretch it out here for a while.
You better get in.
We need to talk.
Actually, Fairy Godmother, off to bed.
Already taken my pills, and they tend to make me a bit drowsy.
What?
Oh, hello.
So, what' s new?
You remember my son, Prince Charming?
Is that you?
My gosh!
It' s been years.
When did you get back?
Oh, about five minutes ago, actually.
I climbed to the highest room in the tallest tower...
Mommy can handle this.
He endures blistering winds and scorching desert!
And what does he find?
Some gender- confused wolf telling him that his princess is already married.
It wasn' t my fault.
He didn' t get there in time.
Stop the car!
Harold.
You force me to do something I really don' t want to do.
Where are we?
Hi.
May I take your order?
My diet is ruined!
I hope you' re happy.
Er... okay.
Two Renaissance Wraps, no mayo... chili rings...
- I' il have the Medieval Meal.
- Curly fries?
- No, thank you.
- Sourdough soft taco, then?
- No, really, I' m fine.
Your order, Fairy Godmother.
This comes with the Medieval Meal.
There you are, dear.
We made a deal, Harold, and I assume you don' t want me to go back on my part.
Indeed not.
So, Fiona and Charming will be together.
- Yes.
- Believe me, Harold.
It' s what' s best.
Not only for your daughter... but for your Kingdom.
What am I supposed to do about it?
Use your imagination.
Come on in, Your Majesty.
# Nobody knows...
Excuse me.
Do I know you?
No, you must be mistaking me for someone else.
Uh... excuse me.
I' m looking for the Ugly Stepsister.
Right.
You see, I need to have someone taken care of.
- Who' s the guy?
- Well, he' s not a guy, per se.
He' s an ogre.
Hey, buddy, let me clue you in.
There' s only one fellow who can handle a job like that, and, frankly... he don' t like to be disturbed.
Where could I find him?
Hello?
Who dares enter my room?
I hope I' m not interrupting, but I' m told you' re the one to talk to about an ogre problem?
You are told correct.
But for this, I charge a great deal of money.
Would... this be enough?
You have engaged my valuable services, Your Majesty.
Just tell me where I can find this ogre.
# You just gotta let it go
# I' m in too deep
Dear Knight, I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude.
Dear Diary...
Sleeping Beauty is having a slumber party tomorrow, but Dad says I can' t go.
He never lets me out after sunset.
Must be like some finishing school.
Mom says that when I' m old enough, my Prince Charming will rescue me from my tower and bring me back to my family, and we' il all live happily ever after.
Mrs. Fiona Charming.
Mrs. Fiona Charming.
Mrs. Fiona Charming.
No, no.
I was just reading a, uh... a scary book.
I was hoping you' d let me apologize for my despicable behavior earlier.
- Okay...
- I don' t know what came over me.
Do you suppose we could pretend it never happened and start over...
- Look, Your Majesty, I just...
Call me Dad.
We both acted like ogres.
Maybe we just need some time to get to know each other.
Excellent idea!
A little father- son time?
I know it would mean the world to Fiona.
Shall we say, 7: 30 by the old oak?
Face it, Donkey!
We' re lost.
We can' t be lost.
We followed the King' s instructions exactly.
"Head to the darkest part of the woods..."
"Past the sinister trees with scary- Iooking branches."
- The bush shaped like Shirley Bassey!
- We passed that three times already!
You were the one who said not to stop for directions.
Oh, great.
My one chance to fix things up with Fiona' s dad and I end up lost in the woods with you!
I' m only trying to help.
I know.
- I' m sorry, all right?
- Hey, don' t worry about it.
I just really need to make things work with this guy.
Yeah, sure.
Now let' s go bond with Daddy.
Well, well, well, Donkey.
What?
I ain' t purring.
Sure.
What' s next?
Hey, Shrek.
Donkeys don' t purr.
What do you think I am, some kind of a...
Fear me, if you dare!
Look!
A little cat.
- Look out, Shrek!
- It' s a cat, Donkey.
Come here, little kitty, kitty.
Come on, little kitty.
Come here, little kitty.
- Hold on, Shrek!
I' m coming!
Get it off!
- Look out, Shrek!
- Get it off!
Hold still!
- Did I miss?
- No.
You got them.
Now, ye ogre, pray for mercy from...
Puss... in Boots!
I' il kill that cat!
- Oh!
That is nasty!
What should we do with him?
Take the sword and neuter him.
Oh, no!
Please!
I implore you!
It was nothing personal, Senor.
I was doing it only for my family.
My mother, she is sick.
And my father lives off the garbage!
The King offered me much in gold and I have a litter of brothers...
Fiona' s father paid you to do this?
The rich King?
Well, so much for Dad' s royal blessing.
Don' t feel bad.
Almost everybody that meets you wants to kill you.
Gee, thanks.
Maybe Fiona would' ve been better off if I were some sort of Prince Charming.
That' s what the King said.
Oh, uh... sorry.
I thought that question was directed at me.
Shrek, Fiona knows you' d do anything for her.
Well, it' s not like I wouldn' t change if I could.
I just wish I could make her happy.
"Happiness."
"A tear drop away."
Think of the saddest thing that' s ever happened to you!
Aw, man, where do I begin?
First there was the time that old farmer tried to sell me for some magic beans.
Then this fool had a party and he have the guests trying to pin the tail on me.
Then they got drunk and start beating me with a stick, going "Pinata!!"
What is a pinata, anyway?
No, Donkey!
I need you to cry!
Don' t go projecting on me.
I know you' re feeling bad, but you got to...
You little, hairy, litter- licking sack of...
Is it on?
Is it on?
This is Fairy Godmother.
I' m either away from my desk or with a client.
But if you come by the office, we' il be glad to make you an appointment.
Have a "happy ever after."
Are you up for a little quest, Donkey?
That' s more like it!
Whoo!
- Stop, Ogre!
I have misjudged you.
- Join the club.
We' ve got jackets.
On my honor, I am obliged to accompany you until I have saved your life as you have spared me mine.
The position of annoying talking animal has already been taken.
Let' s go, Shrek.
- Shrek!
- Aw, come on, Donkey.
Look at him... in his wee little boots.
You know, how many cats can wear boots?
Honestly.
- Let' s keep him!
- Say what?
He' s purring!
- Oh, so now it' s cute.
- Come on, Donkey.
Lighten up.
I should lighten up?
Lighten up?
Shrek!
Shrek?
They' re both festive, aren' t they?
What do you think, Harold?
Um...
Fine.
Try to at least pretend you' re interested in your daughter' s wedding ball.
Honestly, Lillian, I don' t think it matters.
How do we know there will even be a ball?
Mom.
Dad.
- Oh, hello, dear.
- What' s that, Cedric?
Coming.
Mom, have you seen Shrek?
I haven' t.
You should ask your father.
Be sure and use small words, dear.
He' s a little slow this morning.
- Can I help you, Your Majesty?
Mmm!
What do you call this dish?
That would be the dog' s breakfast, Your Majesty.
Ah, yes.
Very good, then.
Carry on, Cedric.
Dad, have you seen Shrek?
- No, I haven' t, dear.
I' m sure he just went off to look for a nice... mud hole to cool down in.
You know, after your little spat last night.
You heard that, huh?
The whole kingdom heard you.
I mean, after all, it is in his nature to be... well, a bit of a brute.
Him?
You know, you didn' t exactly roll out the Welcome Wagon.
Well, what did you expect?
Look at what he' s done to you.
Shrek loves me for who I am.
I would think you' d be happy for me.
Darling, I' m just thinking about what' s best for you.
Maybe you should do the same.
No, really?
That' s the old Keebler' s place.
Let' s back away slowly.
That' s the Fairy Godmother' s cottage.
She' s the largest producer of hexes and potions in the whole kingdom.
Then why don' t we pop in there for a spell?
I' m here to see the...
The Fairy Godmother.
She is not in.
Jerome!
Coffee and a Monte Cristo.
Yes, Fairy Godmother.
Look, she' s not seeing any clients today, OK?
That' s OK, buddy.
We' re from the union.
The union?
We represent the workers in all magical industries, both evil and benign.
Oh, right.
Are you feeling at all degraded or oppressed?
Uh... a little.
We don' t even have dental.
They don' t even have dental.
Okay, we' il just have a look around.
I think it' d be better if the Fairy Godmother didn' t know we were here.
- Know what I' m saying?
- Stop it.
- Of course.
Go right in.
A drop of desire.
Naughty!
A pinch of passion.
lust!
- Excuse me.
Sorry to barge in like this...
What in Grimm' s name are you doing here?
Well, it seems that Fiona' s not exactly happy.
And there' s some question as to why that is?
Well, let' s explore that, shall we?
P, P, P...
Princess.
Cinderella.
Here we are.
"Lived happily ever after." Oh...
No ogres!
Snow White.
A handsome prince.
Oh, no ogres.
Sleeping Beauty.
Oh, no ogres!
Hansel and Gretel?
Thumbelina?
No.
The Golden Bird, the Little Mermaid, Pretty Woman...
No, no, no, no, no!
You see, ogres don' t live happily ever after.
All right, look, lady!
Don' t you point... those dirty green sausages at me!
Your Monte Cristo and coffee.
Sorry.
Ah... that' s okay.
We were just leaving.
Very sorry to have wasted your time, Miss Godmother.
Just... go.
Come on, guys.
Working hard or hardly working, eh, Mac?
Man, that stinks!
You don' t exactly smell like a basket of roses.
- Well, one of these has got to help.
- I was just concocting this very plan!
Already our minds are becoming one.
If we need an expert on licking ourselves, we' il give you a call.
Shrek, this is a bad idea.
Make yourself useful and go keep watch.
Puss, do you think you could get to those on top?
No problema, boss.
I was the great cat burglar of Santiago de Compostela.
Ha- ha- ha- ha!
Shrek, are you off your nut?
Keep watch?
Yeah, I' il keep watch.
- What do you see?
- Toad Stool Softener?
I' m sure a nice BM is the perfect solution for marital problems.
- Uh- uh.
- No!
Try "handsome."
Sorry.
No handsome.
How about "Happily Ever After"?
Well, what does it do?
It says "Beauty Divine."
In some cultures, donkeys are revered as the wisest of creatures.
Especially us talking ones.
Donkey!
We' ve got company.
Can we get on with this?
Finally!
A good use for your mouth.
Come on!
I don' t care whose fault it is.
Just get this place cleaned up!
And somebody bring me something deep fried and smothered in chocolate!
- Charming.
Sweetheart.
This isn' t a good time, pumpkin.
Mama' s working.
Whoa, what happened here?
- The ogre, that' s what!
Where is he, Mom?
I shall rend his head from his shoulders!
I will smite him where he stands!
He will rue the very day he stole my kingdom from me!
Oh, put it away, Junior!
You' re still going to be king.
Pardon.
Um...
Everything is accounted for, Fairy Godmother, except for one potion.
What?
I do believe we can make this work to our advantage.
Maximum strength.
"For you and your true love.
"If one of you drinks this, you both will be fine.
"Happiness, comfort and beauty divine."
- You both will be fine?
- I guess it means it' il affect Fiona, too.
Hey, man, this don' t feel right.
My donkey senses are tingling all over.
Drop that jug o 'voodoo and let' s get out of here.
It says, "Beauty Divine."
How bad can it be?
See, you' re allergic to that stuff.
You' il have a reaction.
And if you think that I' il be smearing Vapor Rub over your chest, think again!
Boss, just in case there is something wrong with the potion... allow me to take the first sip.
Oh, no, no.
I don' t think so.
If there' il be any animal testing, I' il do it.
Now give me that bottle.
How do you feel?
I look any different?
You still look like an ass to me.
Maybe it doesn' t work on donkeys.
- Shrek?
- You drink that, there' s no going back.
- I know.
- I know.
- I know!
- But you love being an ogre!
- I know!
But I love Fiona more.
Shrek, no!
Wait!
I think you grabbed the "Farty Ever After" potion.
Or maybe Fiona and I were never meant to be.
Or maybe Fiona and I were never meant to be.
I feel something coming on.
I don' t want to die.
I don' t want to die.
I don' t want to die!
Oh, sweet sister, mother of mercy.
I' m melting!
I' m melting!
It' s just the rain, Donkey.
Oh.
Things seem bad because it' s dark and rainy and Fiona' s father hired a sleazy hitman to whack you.
It' il be better in the morning.
# Tomorrow
Bet my bottom?
I' m coming, Elizabeth!
Donkey?
- Hey, boss.
Let' s shave him.
- D- Donkey?
We missed you at dinner.
What is it, darling?
I' ve been thinking about what you said.
Ah!
That' s my girl.
It was a mistake to bring Shrek here.
I' m going to go out and find him.
And then we' il go back to the swamp where we belong.
Fiona, please!
Let' s not be rash, darling.
You can' t go anywhere right now.
Look at him!
Quiet.
Good morning, sleepyhead.
Good morning!
- Oh...
- Here, I fetched a pail of water.
Thanks.
Uhh!
A cute button nose?
Thick, wavy locks?
I' m...
I' m...
- Gorgeous!
I' m Jill.
What' s your name?
- Um...
- Shrek?
Are you from Europe?
- You' re tense.
- I want to rub his shoulders.
- I got it covered.
Get in line.
Get in line.
- Have you seen my donkey?
- Who are you calling donkey?
You' re a...
- A stallion, baby!
I can count.
Look at me, Shrek!
I' m trotting!
What' s in that stuff?
"Oh, don' t take the potion, Mr. Boss, it' s very bad."
Side effects may include burning, itching, oozing, weeping.
"Not intended for heart patients or those with... nervous disorders."
Senor?
Midnight?
Why is it always midnight?
I' il be your true love!
- I' il be your true love.
I' il be true... enough.
Look, ladies, I already have a true love.
And take it from me, Boss.
You are going to have one satisfied Princess.
Inside you' re the same old mean, salty...
- Easy.... cantankerous, foul, angry ogre you always been.
And you' re still the same annoying donkey.
- Yeah.
Look out, Princess.
Here comes the new me.
First things first.
- We need to get you out of those clothes.
- Ready?
- Ready!
Oh, God!
My racing days are over!
I' m blind!
Tell the truth.
Will I ever play the violin again?
You poor creature!
Is there anything I can do for you?
Well, I guess there is one thing.
Take off the powdered wig and step away from your drawers.
- Not bad at all.
Is everything all right, Father?
Thank you, gentlemen!
Someday, I will repay you.
Unless, of course, I can' t find you or if I forget.
# Don' t wanna be a richer one
Tell Princess Fiona her husband, Sir Shrek, is here to see her.
# Every time I thought I' d got it made
- Shrek? - # Ch- Ch- Changes
# But I can' t trace time
Fiona?
Hello, handsome.
Shrek!
- Princess!
- Donkey?
That potion worked on you, too?
What potion?
Shrek and I took some magic potion.
Now, we' re sexy!
Shrek?
- Yeah, you wish.
- Donkey, where is Shrek?
He went inside looking for you.
Fiona!
You want to dance, pretty boy?
Are you going so soon?
Don' t you want to see your wife?
Fiona?
Shrek?
Aye, Fiona.
It is me.
What happened to your voice?
But not the way I feel about you.
Fiona?
- Charming?
Dad.
I was so hoping you' d approve.
Who are you?
- Mom, it' s me, Shrek.
I know you never get a second chance at a first impression, but, well, what do you think?
Fiona!
- Fiona, Fiona!
Ho- ho- ho!
I don' t think they can hear us, pigeon.
Don' t you think you' ve already messed her life up enough?
I just wanted her to be happy.
Oh, sweetheart.
But look at me.
Look what I' ve done for her.
It' s time you stop living in a fairy tale, Shrek.
She' s a princess, and you' re an ogre.
That' s something no amount of potion will ever change.
I love her.
If you really love her... you' il let her go.
Senor.
What' s going on?
Where are you going?
You wouldn' t have had anything to do with this, would you, Harold?
There you go, boys.
Just leave the bottle, Doris.
Why the long face?
It was all just a stupid mistake.
I never should have rescued her from that tower in the first place.
I hate Mondays.
I can' t believe you' d walk away from the best thing that happened to you.
What choice do I have?
She loves that pretty boy, Prince Charming.
Come on.
Is he really that good- Iooking?
Are you kidding?
He' s gorgeous!
He has a face that looks like it was carved by angels.
He sounds dreamy.
- You know... shockingly, this isn' t making me feel any better.
It' s for the best.
Mom and Dad approve, and Fiona gets the man she' s always dreamed of.
Everybody wins.
Except for you.
I don' t get it, Shrek.
Aye.
And that' s why I have to let her go.
Excuse me, is she here?
She' s, uh... in the back.
Oh, hello again.
Charming.
You' d better have a good reason for dragging us down here, Harold.
Well, I' m afraid Fiona isn' t really... warming up to Prince Charming.
- No, of course it' s not, dear.
I mean, how charming can I be when I have to pretend I' m that dreadful ogre?
No, no, it' s nobody' s fault.
- What?
- You can' t force someone to fall in love!
I beg to differ.
I do it all the time!
Have Fiona drink this and she' il fall in love with the first man she kisses, which will be Charming.
- What did you say?
I can' t.
I won' t do it.
Oh, yes, you will.
If you remember, I helped you with your happily ever after.
And I can take it away just as easily.
Is that what you want?
Is it?
- Good boy.
Now, we have to go.
He' s hopeless.
He' s all high in the front.
He can never get to the back.
Thank you, Mother.
Mother?
A talking horse!
The ogre!
Bandits!
(Announcer) The abs are fab and it' s gluteus to the maximus here at tonight' s Far, Far Away Royal Ball blowout!
like Miss Muffet' s curds and whey.
Everyone who' s anyone has turned out to honor Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek.
And, oh my, the outfits look gorgeous!
Hansel and Gretel!
What the heck are the crumbs for?
And right behind them, Tom Thumb and Thumbelina!
- Oh, aren' t they adorable!
Here comes Sleeping Beauty!
Tired old thing.
Who is this?
It' s the one, it' s the only...
It' s the Fairy Godmother!
Hello, Far, Far Away!
May all your endings be happy and...
Well, you know the rest!
We' il be right back with the Royal Far, Far Away Ball after these messages.
They bore me to tears.
Flip over to Wheel Of Torture!
I' m not flipping anywhere, sir, until I see Shrek and Fiona.
Whizzes on you guys.
Hey, mice, pass me a buffalo wing!
No, to your left.
Your left!
- Tonight on "Knights"...
- Now here' s a good show!
We got a white bronco heading east into the forest.
Requesting backup.
It' s time to teach these madcap mammals their "devil may mare" attitudes just won' t fly.
Police brutality!
- We warned you!
Ow!
Did someone let the cat out of the bag?
You capitalist pig dogs!
- That' s not mine.
Find Princess Fiona!
Tell her Shrek...
Rewind it!
I' m her husband, Shrek!
Ow!
Ah.
I thought I might find you here.
How about a nice hot cup of tea before the ball?
I' m not going.
The whole Kingdom' s turned out to celebrate your marriage.
There' s just one problem.
That' s not my husband.
I mean, look at him.
Yes, he is a bit different, but people change for the ones they love.
You' d be surprised how much I changed for your mother.
Change?
He' s completely lost his mind!
Why not come down to the ball and give him another chance?
You might find you like this new Shrek.
But it' s the old one I fell in love with, Dad.
I' d give anything to have him back.
Decaf.
Otherwise I' m up all night.
Thanks.
What about my Miranda rights?
You' re supposed to say I have the right to remain silent.
Nobody said I have the right to remain silent!
You have the right to remain silent.
What you lack is the capacity.
Shrek?
Donkey?
Too late.
Pinocchio!
Get us out of here!
Fire in ze hole!
Tell a lie!
- What should I say?
- Anything, but quick!
Say something crazy like "I' m wearing ladies' underwear!"
I am wearing ladies' underwear.
- I most certainly am not!
- I am not!
- What kind?
- It' s a thong!
- Are not.
- Are too!
Hey, hey, hey!
Puss!
Pardon me, would you mind letting me go?
- Quit messing around!
We' ve got to stop that kiss!
I thought you was going to let her go.
Boom!
That' s what I like to hear.
It' s impossible!
We' il never get in.
There' s a moat and everything!
Folks, it looks like we' re up chocolate creek without a Popsicle stick.
- Do you still know the Muffin Man?
Well, sure!
He' s down on Drury Lane.
Why?
Because we' re gonna need flour.
Lots and lots of flour.
Gingy!
Fire up the ovens, Muffin Man!
We' ve got a big order to fill!
It' s alive!
Go, baby, go!
To the castle!
No, you great stupid pastry!
Come on!
Down here!
Look at the pony!
That' s right!
Follow the pretty pony!
Pretty pony wants to play at the castle!
Ladies and gentlemen.
Presenting Princess Fiona and her new husband, Prince Shrek.
Shrek, what are you doing?
I' m just playing the part, Fiona.
Mm.
Cherry flavored.
- Ugh!
- But, Muffin Cake...
C Minor, put it in C Minor.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek.
# Where have all the good men gone
Since when do you dance?
# And I dream of what I need
Hit it!
# I need a hero
All right, big fella!
Let' s crash this party!
Man the catapults!
Fire!
Not the gumdrop button!
Ha- ha!
All right!
# Somewhere after midnight In my wildest fantasy
Go!
After you, Mongo.
More heat, less foam!
# I could swear there is someone Somewhere watching me
Come on!
Puss!
Go!
Your lady needs you!
Today, I repay my debt.
On guard!
- # I need a hero # - Stop!
- Hey, you!
Back away from my wife.
- Shrek?
You couldn' t just go back to your swamp and leave well enough alone.
- Now!
- Pigs und blanket!
Get the wand!
I see London!
I' m a real boy!
Aah!
That' s mine!
Pray for mercy, from Puss...
And Donkey!
She' s taken the potion!
Kiss her now!
No!
- Fiona.
Harold!
You were supposed to give her the potion!
- Mommy!
- Mommy?
Ogres don' t live happily ever after.
Oh, Dad!
- Yup.
He croaked.
Harold?
Dad?
I' d hoped you' d never see me like this.
- Donkey!
No, no, he' s right.
To both of you.
I only wanted what was best for Fiona.
But I can see now... she already has it.
Shrek, Fiona...
Will you accept an old frog' s apologies... and my blessing?
Harold?
I' m sorry, Lillian.
I just wish I could be the man you deserve.
You' re more that man today than you ever were... warts and all.
Boss!
Fiona.
Is this what you want?
- What?
- Because if you kiss me now... we can stay like this.
You' d do that?
- For me?
- Yes.
I want what any princess wants.
To live happily ever after...
with the ogre I married.
Whatever happens, I must not cry!
You cannot make me cry!
No, no.
Aaah!
You still look like a noble steed to me.
Now, where were we?
I remember.
Isn' t we supposed to be having a fiesta?
Uno, dos, quatro, hit it!
# Black cats and voodoo dolls
# That girl' s gonna make me fall
Hey gorgeous!
Amigo, we are off to the Kit- Kat Club.
Come on, join us.
Thanks, compadre.
I' m not in the mood.
We will cheer you up!
Find you a nice burro!
Hey, baby!
Hey, that' s my girl!
All right!
Baby, where you been?
- I' m sorry, too.
I should' ve stayed.
But Shrek had this thing he had to do.
What?
Say it one more time.
What you talking about?
Are you serious?
- Papa!
Look at our little mutant babies!
I got to get a job.
There' s a lot of protesters here.
There' s no way we can cover out there.
- Go!
Now!
- She' s not here.
- Goddamn it!
[Nicky On Radio]
What were my words?
I swear.
Jason, I told them that I believed you.
You' re gonna answer me honestly, or I swear to God I' m gonna kill you.
Who' s Pamela Landy?
- [Nicky On Radio]
- Is she running Treadstone?
No, she' s the deputy director.
[Nicky]
Last week an agency field officer tried to make a buy off of one ofher ops.
He was trying to sell out a mole or something and you got to him before we did.
- I killed him?
- You left a print.
They know it was you.
- Why are you doing this?
Landy will find...
Stop.
Stop.
Last week I was 4, 000 miles away in India, watching Marie die.
They came for me, and they killed her instead.
[Nicky Gasps]
- [Gasps]
- What do you people want with me?
Why are you trying to frame me?
Conklin' s boss.
Is he here in Berlin?
Did he run Treadstone?
Yes.
What was Landy buying?
What kind of files?
[Voices Speaking In Russian, Overlapping]
Neski.
Wh- What?
[Conklin]
When was I here in Berlin?
What are you talking about?
When?
You know my file.
- My first job!
I swear!
- [Sobbing Intensifies]
- I know I was here!
Oh, please.!
Pam, I want to show you something.
It' s Alexanderplatz.
We got three levels, we got 15 tunnels.
They' re all converging in a five- block radius.
How many men are out there?
- [Man]
The ground?
In the building.
It' s done.
- I' m on it.
You' re in a big puddle of shit, Pamela, and you don' t have the shoes for it.
- He said he didn' t know anything about Berlin.
- He knew that Nicky was wearing a wire.
- Don' t you think that was for our benefit?
- He didn' t sound like a man in control to me.
We know he was in Berlin.
And now...
Terminate him?
- He also said you were running Treadstone.
Should we believe that too?
- I' m convinced Bourne knows something.
He knows that you' re after him, and in the interest of self- preservation you might start with that.
Check on those photos.
[Agents Conversing, Indistinct]
[Typing]
All right, I finished my box work, but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy.
Came down here last night... because none of this is making any sense.
But a traitor?
You know that.
There were two charges that were supposed to go off simultaneously.
The second one, over here, didn' t go off.
Bourne would know.
It was staged?
- Show me again.
Well, you put...
[Door Closes]
Pull over.
He' s getting out.
This is not a drill, soldier.
We clear on that?
- I' il see you on the other side.
- Good evening, sir.
How can I help you?
Do you have a reservation?
Actually, is room 645 available?
[Man Speaking German]
That room is occupied.
How about room 644?
It' s right across the hall.
644?
I just need your passport and signature right here, please.
[Elevator Bell Dings]
Ja.
Berlin Polizei.
[Continuing In German]
Where?
How far?
- About five or six minutes.
[Men Speaking German]
[Man, Woman Speaking Russian]
Hi.!
[Gasps]
[Conklin]
[German]
Polizei.!
What the hell' s he doing here?
Maybe he just wanted to stay the night.
- [Shouting In German]
- [Tires Screeching]
Polizei.!
Polizei!
Polizei.!
[Whistle Blowing]
Polizei!
[Continues Shouting In German]
[Grunting, Groaning]
Yeah, so far.
But they found Nicky.
Bourne let her go.
He let her go?
Yeah.
Where' s Danny Zorn?
He ought to head over there and debrief her.
We don' t know yet.
Landy' s upstairs in one of the rooms.
She said she' d call you when she' s done.
Okay.
I think I' il, uh... take a cab back to the hotel.
Mmm.
Why would he come in here?
What are you thinking?
I recognize this room from a photo.
There was a chalk outline right here around the body of Vladimir Neski.
This is where his wife killed him?
Do you still think his wife killed him?
Guess he got out through this window.
We just got word from the Berlin police.
Tell him to wait for me in his hotel.
I' m coming to see him.
[Phone Rings]
[Ringing Continues]
- It' s me.
They' re onto Neski.
They can' t prove anything without Bourne.
Kill Bourne, and you kill this investigation.
I' m afraid, Ward, the time has come for us to part company.
Listen, Yuri, you bought those oil leases with 20 million in stolen C. I. A. Seed money.
We both got rich.
I don' t owe you anything.
The plan can still be salvaged.
You hear me?
Now get him.
[Beep]
I don' t suppose it would do me much good to cry for help, huh?
Not much.
You killed her.
It was a mistake.
It was supposed to be you.
There were files linking me to the Neski murder.
If the files disappeared and they suspected you, they' d be chasing a ghost for 10 years.
So we got in the way.
Is that why Neski died?
Is that why you killed Marie?
You killed Marie... the minute you climbed into her car.
The minute you entered her life, she was dead.
I told you people to leave us alone.
I was halfway around the world.
There' s no place it won' t catch up to you.
It' s how every story ends.
It' s what you are, Jason... a killer.
Go on.!
Do it.!
She wouldn' t want me to.
That' s the only reason you' re alive.
[Chattering]
What was he?
Unlucky.
Collateral damage.
So, what do we do now?
[Phones Ringing]
No, no, no, forget it.
Call me as soon as he' s here.
- Who' s this guy?
That' s the only reason you' re alive.
Got a call from Langley.
Wait, Teddy.
Teddy, who' s this?
There.!
That' s Bourne.
We got something!
- It' s the coat.
What train is that?
- That' s the train to Moscow.
- Why the hell would he go to Moscow?
Get me the Russian interior ministry.

You' re older.
Older than I thought you' d be.
Does that mean a lot to you?
No.
No, you don' t.
What?
It' s not what happened to your parents.
I killed them.
I killed them.
[Gasps Quietly]
It was my job.
It was my first time.
Your father was supposed to be alone.
But then your mother... came out of nowhere,
and I had to change my plan.
It changes things, that knowledge.
Doesn' t it?
When what you love gets taken from you,
you wanna know the truth.
[Sobbing Quietly]
[Bourne]
I hear you' re still looking for me.
Bourne?
What do you want?
I wanted to thank you... for the tape.
[Landy]
We got what we needed.
It' s all tied off.
I guess I owe you an apology.
No.
Off the record.
You know how it is.
Wait.
David Webb.
That' s your real name.
You were born 4- 15- 71 in Nixa, Missouri.
Why don' t you come in and we' il talk about it.
Bourne?
You look tired.
[Man]
# That never see any light #
# Oh, baby #
# So many heartaches, so many faces #
Puppet, sir.
They fall apart before you' re out of the door.
Five then, sir.
It' s handmade!
Please.
My sister, she' s very, very sick.
She' s peddling in the next bar over.
- Do you know my mother?
- No.
I' il give you two.
That' s a bad idea, you know.
- Do I know you?
- My name is Semelier.
I work for a private collector of rare antiquities.
And I didn' t answer.
There' s been a discovery in East Africa.
A Christian church, circa 5 A. D.
No, it' s not possible.
The Byzantine Empire had adopted Christianity at that time... but they never got that far south.
The British have financed a dig to uncover this church.
We believe a rare object waits inside.
We' d like you to find it and bring it back to us.
So you think I' m a thief?
Now you think I' m a thief and a whore.
Simply a man who' s lost faith... in everything except himself.
You know nothing about me.
You' re an Oxford- educated archaeologist... an expert in religious icons.
You were a priest before the war.
So what happened?
This is a leather impression of the artifact we' re looking for... a representation of a mythical demon.
It' s Sumerian.
What makes you think it' s in a church in Africa?
He' s been persuaded to let you join it.
You' re assuming that I will say yes.
You already have.
Left, right, left.
The major will see you now.
Beautiful, aren' t they?
Works wonders for the nerves.
What can you tell me about the dig?
The location is a remote area of the Turkana district... called Derati.
It was discovered several months ago by a detachment of my men... on maneuvers there.
When the powers that be realized its importance, they organized a dig.
What have they learned so far?
That it' s a church where no church should be.
He' il be accompanying you to Derati.
It' s a pleasure to finally meet you, Father Merrin.
- I' ve read all your work at seminary.
- It' s Mr. Merrin.
I was especially impressed with your treatise on the Roman rituals.
I' m no longer a part of that.
I' m sure you didn' t come here to discuss Catholic rituals.
I was actually headed to Kenya to begin missionary work... when Rome learned of the discovery.
They' ve asked me to make sure the site' s religious aspect have the proper consideration.
How come you' ve opened the site to the Vatican?
We haven' t... officially.
You' re both my guests.
Tell me, have you any theories on who might have built this church?
Surely the Vatican has some record of its creation.
We' re as in the dark about it as you are.
- How long have you been with the dig, Chuma?
The British hired me as an interpreter.
What happened here?
Ravaged the valley 50 years ago.
- How many died?
- All of them.
I' m Lancaster Merrin.
Major Granville should have contacted you about my joining the dig.
He did.
Is something bothering you, mate?
No.
- You drink, Merrin?
I shouldn' t... but my will is weak.
Then you might just survive this place.
I understand you' ve uncovered the church dome... but that progress has slowed down.
Right, Doctor?
- I' m Sarah Novak.
Very nice to meet you.
- Lancaster...
You still haven' t made it by my room, Doctor.
I' ve been having this, uh, swelling in the evening.
Thought you might have something I could put on it.
How about a muzzle?
So how are the interior excavations coming along?
- They' re not.
Has the structure collapsed?
No, the church is perfect... but none of the men will enter, those we have left anyway.
Why' s that?
I shall be leaving for the dig in five minutes.
Well... pleasant fellow.
What' s wrong with his face?
Other than that it' s attached to his body?
Could be an allergic reaction or some kind of localized infection.
Do you know why the men won' t enter the church?
- Evil spirits.
- If you believe the Turkana.
- And do you?
I' m a doctor.
But as a priest, surely you must believe in such things.
I' m an archaeologist.
I met Father Francis outside, and he told me you were.
Did he?
Well, he is mistaken.
Father Merrin.
He' s donating the use of a room in his hotel for the mission school.
Father, we are so glad that you are here.
These are my sons, James and Joseph.
- They are learning the Bible.
- We are, uh, Christians.
- Oh, of course.
James.
Very nice meeting you, Doctor.
There' s your goddamn church.
Is this your first assignment, Father?
Before this, I was studying in the archives in the Holy Sea.
The Vatican.
But not really training for missionary work, is it?
This is strange.
It' s 1, 500 years old.
It should be badly weathered.
It' s almost as if it were buried right after it was built.
Where' s Jefferies?
I need to go into the church.
Hyenas?
Even at daytime?
- What' s the matter with him?
- I don' t know.
The heat?
It' s dangerous.
- I' m collecting rocks.
I think you' re about ready for this now.
It' s a tool for professional diggers.
His seizure' s stopped.
I wanted to keep him at the hospital for observation... but the Turkana have stopped trusting my medicine.
You have no idea.
Thank you.
So what is it you hope to find here?
The answer to why a church was built here a thousand years before Christianity arrived.
- You were a priest once, weren' t you?
- Yes, I was.
Bloody savages!
Can' t wipe their own ass without instruction.
- I have to get back to town.
I, uh...
I found this... and, uh, I want you to have it.
It' s a St. Joseph, for luck.
Please, for my behavior.
- Oi, oi!
What the hell are you doing?
- Get the fuck out of here, you little scab!
- Joseph, wait.
- Don' t do that.
I didn' t know you was a fuzzy lover.
These little buggers, they get in everywhere.
How soon can you have the doors to the church uncovered?
A few days.
- And in the meantime, how do we get in?
Chuma' il take you in through the roof.
Following us, Father?
Is it safe to walk around?
Let' s see.
Lucifer.
The Lord' s favorite angel.
Cast out after the war in heaven.
Can' t even trust angels, can you?
- You ever seen anything like it?
- Not this far from Rome.
It' s odd.
Churches were built to exalt heaven... but this, the weapons are pointing downward.
Look behind you, Father.
Desecration of Christ.
Who would do something like this?
The crucifix was broken off from here.
Chuma, is there an inventory of what' s been found here?
I wouldn' t know.
'Cause this place has been vandalized.
Probably the lead archaeologist, Monsieur Bession.
I need to talk to him.
- It' s not possible.
- Why not?
He' s gone mad.
No one' s been inside Bession' s tent since he fell ill?
They are superstitious.
Smart.
- Yes?
- Where' s Bession now?
- A sanitorium in Nairobi.
- A few weeks.
- And he can read and write Aramaic?
- Sorry?
The language spoken in Palestine at the time of Christ.
And what does it say?
The fallen shall rise... in a river of blood. "
Do you have a moment?
Of course.
Or maybe something more substantial?
Yes, that would be very nice.
You dabble in the occult?
I found them here when I arrived.
I wanted to ask you, did you treat Bession?
You should let me clean that before it gets infected.
There was nothing I could do for Monsieur Bession.
He had no medical symptoms... nothing to suggest any kind of disease or infection.
His breakdown was purely mental and extremely severe.
That' s why the Turkana fear the church is cursed.
In the past few weeks, we' ve lost a dozen men.
Runaways?
Or is it those evil spirits?
Yeah.
I shouldn' t have.
- Your curiosity' s perfectly natural.
My father was a strong man.
When the Nazis started rounding up the Jews in our town... he didn' t hesitate.
He hid our neighbors in the crawl space.
But someone turned us in... and we were all sent to the concentration camps.
I' m sorry.
People can' t really understand, can they?
If they weren' t there... if they didn' t see.
And my husband turned out to be one of those people.
I met him after the war, and we came to Africa together, in love.
One night I realized I...
I had to tell him the truth... about... the Nazis... and what they did to me.
After that, he never touched me again.
So... what turns a man of the cloth into an archaeologist?
I suppose I...
I wanted to work with something real, something I could touch with my hands.
Being a priest.
No.
Sometimes I think the best view of God is from hell.
I should get to bed.
I' m going to Nairobi tomorrow to see Bession.
- Gionetti?
He runs the sanitarium.
Well, thank you... for the medical care.
What is your name?
I' m Father Merrin.
God is not here today, priest.
Want some water?
Hey, what' s wrong?
It' s late.
- Oh, is it yours?
- Give it to me!
- Mr. Merrin gave it to me.
- Take it!
- Oh, just give it to me, you idiot!
It' s right here.
Give it to me!
Shorty.
All right.
Go back to bed, and I' il give you the stupid thing.
Joseph, look out!
Get Papa!
Joseph, help me!
- What happened?
They tore James apart.
Did you see that, Lancaster?
The hyenas ignored Joseph.
They were focused on his brother.
That was a lot more than focused.
They acted as if he wasn' t even there.
Monsieur Bession?
Mr. Bession.
You worked on a dig in Derati.
You drew a picture of an idol.
Where did you see it?
Was it in the church?
Mr. Bession.
- Father Merrin.
- How do you know my name?
I said how do you know my name?
No.
I' m free.
God is not here today, priest.
I hope he finds peace.
I' m Father Gionetti.
I' ve been waiting for you.
How did he know my name?
Have you drifted so far from God, Merrin, that you can' t see?
Monsieur Bession was touched by the devil.
Demonic possession?
Forgive me, Father.
Only touched.
So, "touched."
What does that mean?
In 1647, the Ursuline Convent in Loudon, France... was plagued by possession.
Thirty- four nuns had been touched by the devil... committing unspeakable acts.
Having orgies including goats doesn' t make them possessed.
Four priests were dispatched to exorcise the demons.
Three of them were possessed themselves and subsequently died.
The last one was driven insane by his brush... with evil.
That is what happened to Monsieur Bession.
And that evil remains in Derati.
You must be careful there.
Remember, he is the father of lies.
He will seek to poison your mind.
You will need this against him.
The Roman Rituals.
If you need somebody to perform an exorcism, I' m not your man.
I' m not a priest anymore.
Only your faith can save you.
Well, then I' m doomed.
What do you have there?
Can I see?
You threw it away.
- Jefferies, what the hell are you doing in here?
- You threw it away.
- No, I didn' t.
- The clasp must have come loose...
- Liar!
Do I repulse you that much?
Maybe if you could cure my fucking face...
I might look as good to you as that archaeologist.
- He' s coming for you.
What?
He' s coming for you.
- What happened?
- I had a bad dream.
You' il be fine.
Where is everybody?
Sebituana' s baby is coming, so the village has gathered in welcome.
You' re back.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I' m just a little bit tired.
These lesions... they' re not from the shock, are they?
They' re completely asymptomatic.
It just doesn' t make sense.
- He should have recovered by now.
In this part of the world... it could be a dozen things... but his symptoms don' t really match any of them.
So all I can do is just watch and wait.
I have to do some work up at the dig.
- Will you be all right?
Yes.
Come sit with me, Lancaster.
I promise I won' t bite.
What is it?
- How was Nairobi?
- Oh, fine.
- Did you see Monsieur Bession?
- He' s dead.
- I don' t know.
Some accident.
I just don' t understand everything that' s happening here.
Help me hold him.
I' m doing everything I can for him.
WOMAN:
BOY:
Sleep tight, kiddo.
Simulation terminated.
Simulation terminated.
All right, Mr Bile, is it?
Uh- huh.
Mr Bile, can you tell me what you did wrong?
I fell down?
No, no, before that.
Can anyone tell me Mr Bile' s big mistake?
Anyone?
Let' s take a look at the tape.
Here we go.
Ah!
You left it wide open.
Um... it could let in a draft?
It could let in a child!
There is nothing more toxic or deadly than a human child.
A single touch could kill you!
Right into the monster world!
You can' t make me!
You' re going in there because we need this.
Our city is counting on you to collect those children' s screams.
Without scream, we have no power.
Yes, it' s dangerous work and that' s why I need you to be at your best.
I need scarers who are confident, tenacious tough, intimidating.
James P. Sullivan.
Good morning, Monstropolis.
It' s now five after the hour of 6: 00 a. m. in the big monster city.
Temperature' s a balmy 65 degrees -- which is good news for you reptiles -- and it looks like it' s going to be a perfect day to maybe, hey, just lie in bed, sleep in or simply... work out that flab that' s hanging over the bed!
Get up, Sulley!
I don' t believe I ordered a wake- up call, Mikey.
- Feel the burn!
You call yourself a monster?
Scary feet, scary feet, scary feet!
The kid' s awake!
Okay, scary feet, scary feet, scary feet, scary feet --
Kid' s asleep!
Ooh!
I thought I had you there.
Okay, Sulley, here we go.
Follow it.
It' s over here!
Oh, look over there!
Don' t let it touch you!
I love scaring kids in bed!
Scary monsters don' t have plaque!
118... do you have 119?
Do I see 120?
Oh, I don' t believe it!
I' m not even breaking a sweat.
The new commercial' s on!
The future is bright at Monsters, Incorporated.
ANNOUNCER:
We warm your home.
I' m Monsters, Incorporated.
Hey, look!
Carefully matching every child to their ideal monster... to produce superior scream refined into clean, dependable energy.
Monsters, Incorporated is there.
I' m Monsters, Incorporated!
ANNOUNCER:
Human kids are harder to scare.
Of course, M. I. is prepared for the future with the top scarers... the best refineries and research into new energy techniques.
Okay, here I come.
We' re working for a better tomorrow... today!
We' re Monsters, Incorporated!
We' re M. I. -- Monsters, Incorporated.
We scare because we care.
I can' t believe it.
Oh, Mike...
I was on TV!
I' m a natural!
Hello.
I know!
Did the whole family see it?
It' s your mom.
The camera loves me.
I' m telling you, big daddy you' re going to be seeing this face on TV a lot more often.
Like, on Monstropolis' s Most Wanted?
You' ve been jealous of my good looks since the fourth grade, pal.
Have a good day, sweetie.
You, too, hon.
Nope.
Uh- uh.
What are you doing?
We' re walking.
No, no, no, my baby.
I...
Hey, genius, you want to know why
Not really.
To drive it!
With the honk- honk and the vroom- vroom and no walking involved.
Come on, you could use the exercise.
You have your own climate!
How many tentacles jump the rope?
Morning, Sulley!
How you doing?
BlG EYE:
Ah, nuts.
Fellas!
Tony!
Ba- da- bing!
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow!
Ah, just trying to make sure there' s enough scream to go around.
Hey!
- Hey, thanks!
- Grazie!
Oh, great.
Hey, Ted!
Good morning!
Ted' s walking to work.
Guy takes five steps and he' s there.
Morning, Sulley.
Morning, Ricky.
See you on the scare floor, buddy!
Hey, how was jury duty?
Hey!
Hey, it' s still leaning to the left.
Hey, fellas.
Hey, Mr Sullivan!
Guys, I told you, call me Sulley.
We just wanted to wish you good luck today.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
You' re making him lose his focus.
Sorry.
See you later, fellas.
Go get 'em, Mr Sullivan!
You' il make him lose his focus.
Oh, no.
Shut up!
Please hold.
Monsters, Inc.
Would you like her voice mail?
Oh, Schmoopsie- poo.
Happy birthday.
Oh, Googley- woogley, you remembered!
Hey, Sulley- wulley.
Oh, hey, Celia... weelia.
Happy birthday.
Thanks.
So, uh... are we going anywhere special tonight?
Harryhausen' s.
But it' s impossible to get a reservation there!
Not for Googley Bear.
I will see you at quitting time and not a minute later.
Think romantical thoughts.
You know, pal, she' s the one.
That' s it.
She is the one!
I' m happy for you.
They' re under the name Googley Bear.
Oh, good ide...
You know, that wasn' t very funny.
Wazowski!
What do you know?
It scares little kids and little monsters.
I wasn' t scared.
I have... allergies.
Uh- huh.
Hey, Randall, save it for the scare floor, will you?
I' m in the zone today, Sullivan.
Wow, Randall.
That should make it even more humiliating when we break the record first.
Do you hear that?
It' s the winds of change.
Oh, what a creep.
One of these days, I am really... going to let you teach that guy a lesson.
Chalooby!
MlKE:
Good morning, Roz my succulent little garden snail.
And who would we be scaring today?
Wazowski, you didn' t file your paperwork last night.
Wouldn' t it be easier if it all just blew away?
Don' t let it happen again.
I' il try to be less careless.
I' m watching you, Wazowski.
Always watching.
Always!
All scare floors are now active.
Assistants, please report to your stations.
Okay, people, eastern seaboard coming on- line.
We got scarers coming out!
Ooh, they' re so awesome.
Hey... may the best monster win.
I plan to.
We are on in seven... six... five... four... three... two...
You' re the boss.
You' re the big, hairy boss.
Yeah!
Attaboy.
Another door coming right up.
You' re still behind, Randall.
You know, maybe I should realign the scream intake valve.
Just get me another door!
A door!
Well, Jerry, what' s the damage so far?
We may actually make our quota today, sir.
First time in a month.
What happened?
She got this close to me!
I could' ve been dead!
I could' ve died!
Keep it together, man.
We got a dead door over here!
- Coming!
- Out of the way!
- Excuse us.
We' ve lost 58 doors this week, sir.
They just don' t get scared like they used to.
Let her rip!
Uh, sir?
Look.
We have a new scare leader:
Slumber party.
CELlA:
Well, James, that was an impressive display!
Oh, just doing my job, Mr Waternoose.
Of course, I did learn from the best.
I will personally put you through the shredder!
Hey, Wazowski, nice job!
Those numbers are pretty sweet.
Are they?
And, uh... how is Georgie doing?
He' s doing great!
I love working with that big guy.
Keep the doors coming, Charlie.
I' m on a roll today.
George and I are like brothers.
2319!
COMPUTER VOlCE:
Red alert!
George Sanderson please remain motionless.
Get it off!
Duck and cover, people!
Oh, not the CDA.
Move!
Coming through, please.
Clear the contaminated area.
This is a 2319 in progress.
Coming through.
Stand back.
Careful.
Situation is niner- niner- zero.
Ready for decon.
That was a close one.
Okay, people, take a break!
We got to shut down for a half- hour and reset the system.
An entire scare floor out of commission.
Oh... what a day.
Everyone knows you' re going to get us through it.
Tell that to the board of directors.
James, this company has been in my family for three generations.
I would do anything to keep it from going under.
Oh, so would I, sir.
Say, I could use your help with something.
Anything, sir.
You see, we' ve hired some new scare recruits and frankly, they' re... they' re, um... uh...
Inexperienced?
Oh, they stink!
And I thought maybe you might come by tomorrow and give them a demonstration.
Show them what it takes to be a top scarer, huh?
I' il start out with the old Waternoose jump- and- growl.
Now, that' s my boy!
Let' s go, everybody!
No exceptions!
I' ve never seen anything like you today.
That' s right, baby!
I' m taking her to a monster truck rally afterwards.
Nice.
What' s on your agenda?
I' m going to head home and work out some more.
Whew.
Yeah.
I got, uh... smelly garbage or old dumpster.
No.
How about wet dog?
Stink it up.
Give me a break, Mike.
What a night of romance I got ahead of me.
Tonight is about me and Celia.
Ooh, the love boat is about to set sail.
'Cause I got to tell you, buddy that face of hers, it just makes my heart go...
Fun- filled evening planned for tonight?
Well, as a matter of fact...
Then I' m sure you filed your paperwork correctly... for once.
Your stunned silence is very reassuring.
Oh, no.
What am I going to tell...
Hey, Googley Bear.
It' s just that...
Uh, you know, there' s a small....
I don' t understand.
Mike was reminding me.
Thanks, buddy.
Whoo.
Yeah, I was.
Let' s go then.
We' re going!
The pink copies go to Accounting the fuchsia ones go to Purchasing and goldenrod ones go to Roz.
Leave the puce.
Pink copies go to Accounting, the fuchsia ones go to Roz.
The goldenrod ones go to Roz.
Man, I have no idea what puce is.
Oh, that' s puce.
Anyone?
There' s a door here.
Hello?
Kitty!
No, no -- stay back.
Oh, Michael, I' ve had a lot of birthday... well, not a lot of birthdays but this is the best birthday ever.
What are you looking at?
I was just thinking about the first time I laid eye on you -- how pretty you looked.
Your hair was shorter then.
No, no, I like it this length.
I like everything about you.
You know what I said?
What did you say?
I said...
Sulley?
That' s not what I was going to say.
Mike, you' re not making sense.
SULLEY:
What a coincidence, running into you here!
Sulley!
I wonder what' s good here.
Get out of here.
You' re ruining everything.
What?
A door?!
Wait a minute.
He' s trying to boost his numbers!
There' s something else.
Ook- lay in the ag- bay.
Look in the bag.
What bag?
They don' t have anything I like here.
Excuse me, sir.
What' s going on?
Celia, please try to understand.
Michael?
On three.
One... two....
A kid!
Boo!
A kid!
There' s a kid here -- a human kid!
Googley Bear!
Let' s get out of here!
Please remain calm.
This is not a drill.
Please advise.
Michael?
- Ow.
Hey, get your hands off my Schmoopsie- poo!
Ready for decontamination.
Well, I don' t think that date could have gone any worse.
If witnesses are to be believed there has been a child security breach for the first time in monster history.
We can neither confirm nor deny the presence of a human child here tonight.
Well, a kid flew right over me and blasted a car with its laser vision!
I tried to run from it, but it picked me up with its mind powers and shook me like a doll!
I saw the whole thing!
It is my professional opinion that now is the time to... panic!
It' s coming!
Boo!
Come here, kid.
No, don' t touch those, you little...!
Oh, now those were alphabetized.
As long as it doesn' t come near us we' re going to be okay.
Wanna ride on it!
Fetch!
Hey, hey, that' s it!
No one touches little Mikey!
Mike, give her the bear.
Make it stop!
See the bear?
Ooh, nice bear.
Sulley!
Ooh, bear, ooh.
Oh, he' s a happy bear.
Or we' il be in trouble
So please stop crying
Good, good, Sulley.
You' re doing great.
Sulley, the bear!
The bear!
Give her the...
What was that?
I have no idea but it would be really great if it didn' t do it again.
How could I be so stupid?
This could destroy the company.
The company?
What about us?
La- la- la- la- la- la
I bet it' s just waiting for us to fall asleep and then wham!
We' re sitting targets.
Okay, look, I think
I have a plan here.
Using mainly spoons, we dig a tunnel under the city and release it into the wild.
Spoons.
That' s it, I' m out of ideas.
We' re closed.
Too expensive.
Giant slingshot?
Too conspicuous.
Enormous wooden horse?
Too Greek!
No plan.
Can' t think.
Uh, Mike?
I think she' s getting tired.
While I think of a plan!
Are you sleepy?
Is that what you want?
No.
You' re going to get your germs all over it.
Fine.
My chair is more comfortable anyway.
Will you go to sleep?
Hey, that looks like Randall.
Randall' s your monster.
You think he' s going to come through the closet and scare you.
Uh, it' s empty.
- Ah!
No monster in here.
Well, now there is but I' m not going to scare you.
I' m off- duty.
How about I sit here, until you fall asleep?
Go to sleep.
Now.
Now... go.
Uh, you... go... to... sleep.
Hey, Mike, this might sound crazy but I don' t think that kid' s dangerous.
Really?
Now, look.
What if we just put her back in her door?
If we send her back, it' s like it never happened.
Tell me you' re joking.
I have been extremely forgiving up to now but that is a horrible idea!
Then I guess we just waltz right up to the factory, right?
Sulley, a mop, a couple of lights and some chair fabric are not going to fool anyone!
Just think about a few names, will you?
We could be next!
Don' t panic -- we can do this.
Hey, guys.
Everything' s going to be okay.
Number One wants this place dusted for prints.
Careful with that.
I got a good view from here.
A little lower.
This was recovered at the scene.
Don' t panic!
Everything is not okay!
Boo.... could be contaminated.
Gentlemen, safety is our number one concern.
If there' s anything that...
Not now, not now.
Where did you come from?
Mr Waternoose!
Is this one yours?
Actually, that' s my, uh, cousin' s sister' s daughter, sir.
"Bring an Obscure Relative to Work Day."
Hmm, must have missed the memo.
Well, listen, James why don' t you stop by the simulator after lunch today and give us that scare demonstration we talked about, huh?
Excuse me, Mr Waternoose?
Yes, yes, I' m coming.
Oh, boy.
Why am I the last to know?
She' il be a big hit!
Halt!
Stop him!
Hold him down.
Come on, the coast is clear.
So, wait here while I get its card key.
This is the men' s room.
It' s fine.
It' s dancing with joy!
I' il be right back with its door key.
That' s a cute little dance you' ve got.
It almost looks like you' ve got to...
Uh, are you done in there?
Sorry.
Okay, you finished now, right?
Where did she go?
Oh, did she disappear?
Did she turn invisible?
I just have no idea.
Gotcha!
Hey, you' re good.
Be relaxed, be relaxed, be relaxed.
Roz, my tender, oozing blossom you' re looking fabulous today.
It' s a new haircut, isn' t it?
You' ve had a lift.
You' ve had something.
Something has been inserted in your skin that makes you look like...
Listen, I need a favour.
Randall was working late last night out on the scare floor.
Well, isn' t that nice?
But guess what?
You didn' t turn in your paperwork last night.
He didn' t...
I... no paperwork?
This office is now closed.
Ready or not, here I come!
I' m getting warmer.
Any second now.
Fee fifo...
What are you doing?!
I- I' m looking for the kid.
You lost it?!
No, no, she was just....
Here she is.
Hey, what' s the matter?
I already told your buddies I haven' t seen anything.
All right.
Thank goodness!
Shh!
The child -- the one you were after.
Will you be quiet?!
Don' t you think I' m aware of the situation?
I was up all night trying to find it.
I did a simple calculation factoring in the size of the sushi restaurant.
The child may have escaped!
Yeah, well, until we know for sure we' re going to act like nothing happened, understand?
You just get the machine up and running.
Oh!
Come on, go!
Move!
Ow, ow!
They' re gone.
This is bad.
This is so very bad.
What were they talking about a machine?
Who cares?
You' re right.
We will blend right in.
Top of the mornin ', fellas!
Hey, what' s shakin ', bacon?
Or a limb?
You have her card key, right?
I told you I' d get her card key.
I went and got her card key and now I have her card key.
Okay, here we go.
Try not to run through any more closets.
What are you talking about?
Of course it' s her door.
No, her door was white and it had flowers on it.
It must have been dark last night because this is its door.
Hey, you hear that?
Sounds like fun in there!
That' s Mike Wazowski, care of 22 Mike- Wazowski - you- got- your- life- back Lane.
Mowki Kowski.
Now bon voyage!
Come on.
See the stick?
Go fetch.
Boo?
What' s Boo?
Is there a problem?
Once you name it, you start getting attached to it!
Now put that thing back where it came from, or so help me...
We' re rehearsing a scene for the upcoming company play
Or So Help Me.
It' s a musical!
So help me, so help me.
It' s a work in progress but, hey, we need ushers.
Now say goodbye to... where' d it go?
What' d you do with it?
Where is she?
She got away from you again?!
Well, that is just...
The sun is coming up.
This is perfect!
She' s gone!
Sulley, please, don' t blow this.
It' il be their problem, not ours!
What are you two doing?
They' re rehearsing a play.
Can it, Wazowski!
So, what do you think of that kid getting out, Sullivan?
Oh, yeah, crazy.
Word on the street is the kid' s been traced back to this factory.
Uh, well, uh...
No, no way!
Waxford?
You know, he' s got them shifty eyes.
Hey, Waxford!
Sulley!
Michael Wazowski!
Last night was one of the worst nights of my entire life, bar none!
I thought you cared about me.
Schmoopsie, I thought you liked sushi.
Sushi?!!
Wazowski!
Mike...
Men.
Keep breathing.
Kid?
What kid?
You' re not pinning this on me.
It never would have gotten out if you hadn' t been cheating last night!
Cheating.
Okay, I think I know how to make this all go away.
What happens when the whistle blows in five minutes?
I get a time- out?
Everyone goes to lunch!
Which means the scare floor will be...?
It' il be empty, you idiot!
When the big hand is pointing up and the little hand is pointing up the kid' s door will be in my station.
But when the big hand points down the door will be gone.
You have until then to put the kid back.
Get the picture?
Boo!
No.
Halt!
Affirmative.
Oh, oh, sure.
No problem.
Let' s see....
like that again, we' re through! "
What' d she say?
You know my mom.
She sent me to my room.
Take it easy.
Bottoms up!
Oh, well, hello, there.
What' s your name?
Mike Wazowski!
Sulley!
Okay, Sulley, come on, enough.
Nope.
Oh, Sulley!
Boy, Wazowski looks like he' s in trouble.
2319!
We have a 2319!
Oh, dear.
Sulley?
Sulley!
I got us a way out of this mess but we got to hurry.
Where is it?
Sull, that' s a cube of garbage.
I- I can still hear her little voice.
Mike Wazowski!
Hey, I can hear her, too.
BABY MONSTERS:
How many kids you got in there?
Kitty!
Boo!
Boo, oh, you' re all right!
I was so worried!
Don' t you ever run away from me again, young lady!
Oh, but I' m so glad you' re safe.
My, what an affectionate father.
Actually, she' s my cousin' s sister' s...
Okay, Sulley.
That' s enough.
Mike Wazowski!
Yeah, yeah.
We' re in a...
Will you stop making Boo laugh?
I didn' t, so come on!
You' ve got Boo' s door?
Run.
Okay, let' s move, let' s move, let' s move.
Oh, please be there, please be there, please be there.
Just like Randall said!
Wait a minute.
Oh, hey.
One, two, three, four!
Get the kid back through the door!
The nightmare is over.
Hey, it' s okay, Boo.
Come on, it' s time to move!
He' s after Boo.
Let' s go.
This is a limited time offer.
I don' t like this.
Now, let' s move.
No, Mike.
He wants the door, I get the door...
Mike, wait!
He' s a paranoid delusional furball.
Mike!
Hey, Sulley, where you been all day?
Mike?
Where are you?
You in there?
Where are you, buddy?
Boo, way to go.
It' s okay.
RANDALL:
I got the kid!
That' s great news.
Not that I was concerned, of course.
Just get over here and help me!
While we' re young here, Fungus!
Kid needs to take off a few pounds.
Where is it, you little one- eyed cretin?
Okay, first of all, it' s cree- tin.
If you' re going to threaten me do it properly.
Second of all, you' re nuts if you think kidnapping me is going to help you cheat your way to the top!
You still think this is about that stupid scare record?
Well...
I did, right up until you chuckled like that and now I' m thinking I should just get out of here.
I am about to revolutionise the scaring industry and when I do, even the great James P. Sullivan is going to be working for me.
Well somebody' s certainly been a busy bee.
First, I need to know where the kid is and you' re going to tell me.
Uh- huh, sure.
I mean, I don' t.
What' s that?
Wait, wait, wait.
This thing is moving.
I don' t like big... moving things that are moving towards me.
Hey, Randall!
Say hello to the scream extractor.
Hello.
Come on, where you going?
Come on.
What is that thing?
Wait, wait, wait!
Stop, stop!
No, no!
Help!
Help!
What did you do wrong this time?
I calibrated the drive...
Go check the machine!
There must be something wrong with the scream intake valve.
Fungus.
You like cars, huh?
'Cause I got a really nice car.
Please, Fungus?
I' m not allowed to fraternize with victims of his evil plot.
Where' s Wazowski?
Where is he?!
He' s going to kill us!
That could be contaminated.
We got to get out of here now!
We can start a whole new life somewhere far away.
Goodbye, Mr Waternoose!
No, Mike, wait!
Hey, what are you doing?
I have an idea.
No!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no...
Simulation terminated.
No, no, no, no, no.
You' re trying to scare the kid, not lull it to sleep.
I was going for a snake/ ninja approach with a little hissing.
How many times do I have to tell you?
About how you enter the room!
Mr Waternoose!
James!
Perfect timing.
Sir, you don' t understand.
What?
Sir... sir, you have to listen to me.
You' re about to see the best in the business.
Reset the simulator.
But- but, sir!
ANlMATRONlC BOY:
No, Boo, no, no!
Now, give us a big, loud roar.
Mr Waternoose, there' s no time for this.
What are you waiting for?
But- but- but, sir!
Roar!
Well done.
Well done, James.
Boo?
- Right this way, everyone.... a valuable lesson in scaring today.
Boo.
Boo, it' s me.
The child!
I know it sounds crazy, but trust me.
It' s okay.
I was just...
No, no, no, no, no, don' t be scared.
That wasn' t real.
It' s just a...
I was just...
Boo.
This whole thing is Randall' s fault.
And we can take you to his secret lab, which is right here in this factory.
Oh, how could this happen?
No, sir.
Good.
This company can' t afford any more bad publicity.
Now, before we do anything else, let' s... take care of the child.
Oh, I never thought things would come to this... not in my factory.
Especially you, James.
But now we can set everything straight again for the good of the company.
Uh... sir, that' s not her door.
I know, I know.
It' s yours.
Boo!
No!
No!
We' re in the human world!
Too bad he was in on the whole thing!
All you had to do was listen to me -- just once!
You' re still not listening!
Take that!
Welcome to the Himalayas!
"Abominable"!
Do I look abominable to you?
Why can' t they call me the Adorable Snowman or... or the Agreeable Snowman, for crying out loud?
I' m a nice guy.
Yuck.
Don' t worry -- it' s lemon.
Snow cone?
looked at me?
Ah, poor guy.
It ain' t easy being banished.
When he was banished he fashioned an enormous diaper out of poison ivy.
Called himself King Itchy.
Banished with your best friend.
Oh.
I just assumed you were buddies, you know when I saw you out there in the snow hugging and all that.
A stupid kid!
Because of you, I am now stuck in this frozen wasteland!
Wasteland?
I think you mean wonderland!
Cutest thing in the world.
I haven' t even mentioned all the free yak' s milk.
What... what did you say?
Yak' s milk.
You know, once you pick the hairs out it' s very nutritious.
No, no.
Where?
Sure.
Where is it?!
Around a three- day hike.
Oh, three days?!
We need to get there now!
You want to go to the village?
Okay, rule number one out here.
Always...
Never go out in a blizzard.
We need to get to Boo.
What about us?
Ever since that kid came in you' ve ignored everything I' ve said and now look where we are!
We would have had it made!
None of that matters now.
None of it matter...
Wa- wait a second.
None of it matters?
Okay.
Great.
So, now the truth comes out, doesn' t it?
Oh, would you look at that?
We' re out of snow cones, uh...
Let me... just go outside and make some more.
Sulley, what about everything we ever worked for?
Does that matter?
And what about Celia?
I am never... never going to see her again.
Doesn' t that matter?
What about me?
I' m...
Don' t I matter?
I' m sorry we' re stuck out here.
I didn' t mean for this to happen.
I think there might be a way to save her if we can just get down to that...
"We"?
"We"?
There' s no "we" this time, pal.
I- if- if you want to go out there and freeze to death you be my guest... because you' re on your own.
Hey, I got more snow cones!
I know you can do this.
Nice, quiet Nepal.
You know, you' re right.
Here, take this.
Go get 'em, Georgie!
Look out!
Sorry, George.
Hey, you can' t just... 23...
- Whoa!
I never should have trusted you with this.
Because of you, I had to banish my top scarer!
Besides, Sullivan got what he deserved.
Sullivan was twice the scarer you will ever be!
Kitty!
Kitty!
Wh- whoa!
Sorry, Boo.
Stop him!
Let' s get you home.
Finish him off!
I' ve wanted to do that, Sullivan.
Ooh!
Look, it' s not that I don' t care about the kid.
Mike, you don' t understand.
I needed some time to think.
But you shouldn' t have left me out there.
I' m being attacked!
Just hear me out.
Nothing is more important than our friendship.
He' s too sensitive.
If you start crying, I' m going to cry and I' il never get through this.
I' m sorry I wasn' t there for you but I am now.
The least you could do is pay attention!
It' s...
Get up!
There can' t be any witnesses.
There won' t be.
I' m glad you came back, Mike.
Somebody' s gotta take care of you, you big hair ball.
Schmoopsie- poo, I really can' t talk.
Come on!
You hear me?
You know the kid that they' re looking for -- Sulley let her in.
We tried to send her back but Waternoose had this secret plot and now Randall' s right behind us and he' s trying to kill us!
You expect me to believe that pack of lies, Mike Wazowski?!
Mike Wazowski!
RANDALL:
Look out, you...
Oh!... idiot!
Look out.
Coming through, here, coming through!
Hurry up.
There they are!
Attention, employees:
Randall Boggs has just broken the all- time scare record.
Huh?
No, I didn' t.
Get out of my way!
Go get 'em, Googley Bear!
RANDALL:
Let me through!
Grab on, Mike!
Are you out of your...?
Sulley, what are we doing?
We have to get Boo' s door and find a station.
MlKE:
What a plan -- simple, yet insane!
Hold on!
Don' t look down!
I' m gonna be sick!
There it is!
MlKE:
How are we supposed to get it now?
Oh, it' s a dead end, Sulley!
Make her laugh.
Just do it!
Get it open.
Here he comes.
Give me that kid!
Come on.
We got to find another door.
Look, Boo' s door!
There he is!
Give me your hand.
Ooh, right, right, right.
I' m behind you!
Hurry up!
Get inside!
That was weird.
Mike?
Oh, sorry, buddy.
I hope that hurt, lizard boy!
Great job, buddy.
We lost him.
Nice working with you!
Get it open!
- Open the door!
Come on, get in here!
Boo!
There they are!
Sulley!
Looks like we caught the express, pal.
Do you see them?
Straight ahead!
Kitty!
Boo!
Look at everybody' s favourite scarer now!
You stupid, pathetic waste!
Now your time is up!
And don' t worry.
I' il take good care of the kid.
She' s not scared of you any more.
Looks like you' re out of a job.
Let' s see the ol 'stuff here, pal.
Hum, baby.
No!
Another gator?!
Give me that shovel!
Get him, Mama!
Care to do the honours, Mikey?
With pleasure.
You beat him.
Come on.
Okay, Boo, it' s time to go home.
Take care of yourself, and be a good girl, okay?
Oh, no!
The power' s out!
Make her laugh again.
It' il bring down the house.
What?!
What' d you do, forget to check if her stupid hood was up ya big dope?!
Uncle Mike, try not to yell in front of her.
Right.
Look!
Huh?
Whoa!
What' s happening?
Hold on!
When the door lands in this station, cut the power.
You' il have the child and the criminals responsible for this whole mess.
A welcoming committee!
What are we going to do?!
This is the CDA.
Come out slowly with the child in plain sight.
You got us.
Here' s the kid.
But before you take us away, I have one thing to say:
Catch!
2319!
We have a toxic projectile!
Halt!
Bring in reinforcements!
Stop him!
Don' t let them get away.
Come back!
He has the child!
Sullivan!
Me not go!
Give her to me!
WATERNOOSE:
Open this door!
Don' t do it.
Don' t go in that room!
I think we stopped him, Boo.
You' re safe now.
You be a good girl, okay?
This has gone far enough, James.
Just leave her alone!
She' s seen too much.
It doesn' t have to be this way.
I have no choice!
Scaring isn' t enough any more.
But kidnapping children?!
I' il kidnap a thousand children before I let this company die and I' il silence anyone who gets in my way!
Good night, Mom.
Good night, sweetheart.
What?
Well, I don' t know about the rest of you guys but I spotted several big mistakes.
MlKE:
Let' s watch my favourite part again... shall we?
I' il kidnap a thousand children before I let this company die.
I' il kidnap a thousand children before...
I' il get him.
All right, come with us, sir.
Wh- what are you doing?
You can' t arrest me!
Monsters, Incorporated is dead!
Where will everyone get their scream now?!
The energy crisis will only get worse because of you!
Number One wants to talk to you.
Attention!
Hello, boys.
Roz?!
Two and a half years of undercover work were almost wasted when you intercepted that child, Mr Sullivan.
Of course, without your help, I never would have known that this went all the way up to Waternoose.
Now... about the girl...
I just want to send her home.
Very good.
Bring me a door shredder.
What, you mean... you mean, I can' t see her again?
That' s the way it has to be.
I' il give you five minutes.
Well, so long, kid.
Mike Wazowski!
Ah, Boo, it' s been fun.
Go grow up.
Oh, look at that.
Oh, that' s cute, yeah.
Uh, Boo, um...
Come here, you!
Oh, he' s a happy bear...
Mm...
Goodbye, Boo.
Kitty.
Kitty has to go.
Boo!
Kitty?
None of this ever happened, gentlemen.
And I don' t want to see any paperwork on this.
Take him away.
I bet we get the rest of the day off.
You idiot!
They' re going to shut down the factory!
I' m telling you, pal, when that wall went up you should have seen the look on Waternoose' s face.
I hope we get a copy of that tape.
Hey, you all right?
Come on, pal, cheer up, we did it!
We got Boo home.
Ah, sure, we put the factory in the toilet, and... gee, hundreds of people will be out of work now.
Not to mention the angry mob that' il come after us when there' s no more power, but, hey... at least we had some laughs, right?
Laughs...
Hello?
Hey, good evening.
Nice to see you.
Where you from?
You' re in kindergarten, right?
Best three years of my life.
Of my life.
Dodgeball was the best.
I was the fastest one out there.
Course I was the ball.
But I... was the ball, see?
All right.
Hey, thanks a lot.
I' il be here all week.
Remember to tip your waitresses.
You filled your quota on the first kid of the day.
You know, only somebody with perfect comedic timing could produce this much energy in one shot.
CELlA:
Come here, you.
Googley.
Girls!
Stop, stop, stop!
Michael, you' re such a charmer.
Hey, did you bring the magazine?
They just delivered a whole box.
Let me see it!
Sulley and I made the cover, right?
I don' t believe it.
- Googley Bear...
I' m on the cover of a magazine!
Oh, this is great!
Oh.
I was, uh, just...
Well, listen, if you got a minute there' s something I want to show you.
Follow me.
No peeking.
Come on, keep coming.
Follow the sultry sound of my voice.
Okay, stop.
Open them.
Mike... is that...?
Sorry it took so long, pal.
It was a lot of wood to go through.
You know, it only works if you have every piece.
Boo?
Kitty!
- Marker.
And... action.
If I were a rich man
With a million or two
I' d live in a penthouse
In a room with a view
No way.
It could happen.
Those dreams do come true
I wouldn' t have nothing if I didn' t have you
Wouldn' t have nothing if I didn' t have
Wouldn' t have nothing...
Okay, cut.
Hello?
Hello.
Come on, get lost, you two.
You' re making him lose his focus.
Oh, sorry.
See you later, fellas.
You idiot!
It' s Sullivan, not Solomon!
What?
Sorry.
We' re never going to work in Hollywood again!
Shut up!
You' re making it worse!
Duck and cover, people!
Hey, thanks, guys.
That was a close one.
Oh, Boo, it' s been fun.
Go throw up.
What?
Cut.
Good morning!
Cut.
Do I get the part?
Thank you.
Can I do it again?
Next!
And action!
Let' s move, let' s move!
Can we get a little more wax on the floor, please?
Randall?
He' s trying to boost his numbers!
What?!
Look- lay in the bag- bay.
What?
Well, you know, maybe you should just take a minute and ead- ray your ipt- scray.
You think he' s in going to come through the closet and scare you.
Oh, boy, how do I explain this?
See?
Guess who.
Action.
Okay, very funny.
Hey, I look good in a suit.
Marker.
And action.
Let her rip.
Go.
Shut it off!
Pull the lever!
You' re making it worse!
But I must admit it
Big guy, you always come through
I wouldn' t have nothing if I didn' t have you
You and me together
That' s how it always should be
One without the other don' t mean nothing to me
Nothing to me...
We' re rehearsing a scene for the upcoming company play
Or So Help Me.
It' s a musical!
Bom- bom, bom- bom, bom- bom...
Get that thing away from me, you guys
Put that thing back where it came from
Or I' il poke myself in the eye!
It' s gonna get better.
Ladies and gentlemen welcome to this year' s company play starring, written and directed by Mike... and produced!
Oh.
Put that thing back where it came from, or so help me
So help me get by
So help me
Your seat is right over there, sir.
There' s a human child
This is really wild
What in heaven' s name will become of us?
We who are living in Monstropolis?
Tell us where the kid is.
Never!
She' s out of our hair
And just when I dare... to care
She says, "au contraire"
You' re my pair... of friends
I love you.
Keep it together, man!
And so we put that kid back where she came from
And she helped us to find
A better tomorrow today!
What a night for my mother to be in the audience!
Ladies and gentlemen my mom!
Thank you, Monstropolis!
SULLEY:
Both know it' s true
I wouldn' t have nothing if I didn' t have
I wouldn' t have nothing if I didn' t have
I wouldn' t have nothing if I didn' t have you
Wouldn' t have nothing if I didn' t have you.
One more time.
That means you, yeah.
Once upon a time there was a lovely princess.
But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort, which could only be broken by Love' s first kiss.
She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire breathing dragon.
Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but none prevailed.
Like that' s ever going to happen.
What a loony.
I think he' s in here.
Lets get it!
Do you know what that thing can do to you?
He' il groan into your bones for his brains.
Now Ogres, huh, they are much worse.
They' il make a soup from your freshly peeled skin.
They' il chew your livers, squeeze the jelly from your eyes.
Actually, it' s quite good on toast.
Back, back beast, back!
I warned you!
Right.
This is the part, where you run away.
And stay out.
Wanted.
Take it away.
Give me that.
- 25 pieces of silver for the witch.
Next.
- Come on.
And be quiet!
This cage is so small.
You wouldn' t turn me in.
I can change.
Please, give me another chance.
Oh, shut up!
Next.
What do we got?
This little wooden puppet.
I' m not a puppet, I' m a real boy.
Five shillings for the possessed toy.
Take it away.
No!
Please, don' t let them do it!
Next.
What do you got?
Well, I' ve got a talking donkey!
Right.
Well that' s good for ten schillings, if you can prove it.
Oh, go ahead fella.
Well?
He' s just a li..., just a little nervous.
He' s really quite a chatterbox.
That' s it.
I have heard enough.
No, no, he talks, he does!
I can talk.
I love to talk.
I' ve talked to...
Get her out of my sight!
- He can fly!
- He can fly!
He can talk!
- That' s right, fool!
Now I' m a flying, talking donkey!
But I bet you ain' t never seen a donkey fly!
Seize him!
This way!
Hurry!
You there.
Ogre.
- I.
And transport you to designated resettlement facility.
Oh really?
You and what army?
Can I say something to you?
Incredible.
Are you talking to...... me?
Yes, I was talking to you.
Can I just tell you that you were really great back there with those guards.
And then you showed up and BAM.
There was tripping on over themselves like babes in the woods.
That really made me feel good to see that.
Really.
Man, it' s good to be free.
Now, why don' t you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends?
But I...
And I' m not going out there by myself.
I have a great idea...
I' il stick with you.
You and me in green fighting machine.
Together we' il scare the spin if anybody crosses us.
Maybe you don' t mine me saying.
'cause your breath stinks!
Man I had some strong gases leaking out of my but that day.
Why are you following me?
I' il tell you why.
There' s no one to derive me.
- Stop singing!
Well, it' s no wonder, you don' t have any friends.
Only a true friend would be that truly honest.
Little donkey.
Take a look at me!
A...... really tall?
No!
I' m an Ogre.
You know, grab your torch and pitchforks.
Doesn' t that bother you?
Nope.
Really?
- Really really.
Oh?
Man, I like you.
What' s your name?
A..., Shrek.
Shrek?!
You' ve got that kind of:
"I don' t care what nobody thinks of me" thing.
You' re all right.
Uh, look at that.
Who would wanna live in a place like that?
That would be my home.
Oh, it is lovely.
Just beautiful.
You know you' re quite a decorator.
It' s amazing what you did with such a modest budget.
I like that boulder.
That is a nice boulder.
I guess, you don' t entertain much, do you?
I like my privacy.
You know I do to.
You try to give them a hint and they won' t leave.
And then there' s that big occurred silence, you know?
Can I stay with you?
- What?
Can I stay with you, please.
Of course!
- Really?
No.
I don' t want to go back there.
But that' s why we have to stick together!
Please!
- But one night only.
- Huh, thank you!
A, what are you do...
No!
This is going to be fun.
We can stay up late, swap the manly stories.
And in the morning...
I' m making waffles.
Where do I sleep?
Outside!
Oh, a, I guess that' s cool.
You know, I don' t know you and you don' t know me...... so I guess, outside is best for me.
Here I go.
Good night.
I do like that half door.
I' m a donkey all alone outside.
Sit by myself outside, I guess.
I' m all alone, there' s no one here beside me.
- I thought, I told you to stay outside.
- I am outside.
It' s not...
What a lovely bed.
- Got you!
I found some cheese.
Awful stuff.
- Is that you Gordon?
- How did you know?
Enough!
What are you doing in my house?
Oh, no, no, no...
Death prods off the table!
Where would we supposed to put her.
The bed' s taken.
What?
I live in a swamp.
I' ve put up signs.
I' m a terrifying Ogre!
What do I have to do, to get a little privacy?
Oh, no!
No, no!
What are you doing in my swamp?
All of you.
Come on, let' s go.
And hurry up, hurry up.
Not there!
Hey don' t look at me.
I didn' t invite them.
Oh gosh, no one invited us.
- What?
We were forced to come here.
- By who?
He???
All right.
Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?
Oh I do.
I know where he is.
Does anyone else know where to find him?
- Anyone at all?
- Anyone?
Oh pick me, I know!
Me, me.
Ok, fine.
Attention all fairy tale things!
Your welcome is officially warned up.
I' m gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get all off my land and back where you came from.
You.
You' re coming with me.
All right.
That' s what I like to hear, man.
Shrek and Donkey, two stubborn friends off on a world and big city adventure.
I love it.
I' m on road again.
Sing with me Shrek!
I' m on road again...
What did I say about singing?
- Can I whistle?
- No.
- Well, can I hummer?
- All right.
That' s enough.
He' s ready to talk.
Run, run, run as fast as you can, you can' t catch me.
I' m the gingerbread man.
You monster.
I' m not a monster here.
You are.
You and the rest of that fairytale trash, poisoning my perfect world.
- Now tell me!
Where are the others?
- Eat me.
I' ve tried to be fair to you, creatures.
Now my patience has reached its end!
Or I' il...
- No, no, not the buttons.
Not gumdrop buttons.
All right!
Who' s hiding them?
Ok, I' il tell you.
- Do you know the muffin- man?
- The muffin- man?
- The muffin- man.
- Yes, I know the muffin- man.
Who lives on Proully lane?
- Well, she' s married to the muffin- man.
- The muffin- man!
- The muffin- man!
- She' s married to the muffin- man.
My lord!
We found it.
Well then, what are you waiting for?
Bring it in.
Magic mirror.
Don' t tell him anything!
Evening.
Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all?
Well, technically, you' re not a king.
- You were saying.
- What I mean is a...... you' re not a king, yet.
All you have to do, is marry a princess.
Go on.
And here they are.
Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shading from a kingdom far, far away.
She likes sushi and hottubbing anytime.
Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for two evil sisters.
Please welcome...
Cinderella.
Bachelorette number two is a kemp wearing girl from a land of fantasy.
Although she lives with seven other man, she is not easy.
Just kiss hers dead frozen lips and find out what a live wife she is.
Give it up for...
Show- white.
And last but certainly not least.
But don' t let that cool you off.
She' s a loaded pistol who likes Pina Coladas and getting cut in the rain.
Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona.
So will it be, bachelorette number one?
Bachelorette number two?
Or bachelorette number three?
- Two... - Three!
- Two!
One.
No, no, no.
Three.
Pick number three my lord.
Ok, ok.
Number three.
Lord Farquaad.
You' ve chosen... princess Fiona.
She' s nice.
Fiona.
She' s perfect.
All I have to do is just find someone...
But I probably should mention little thing that happens at night...
- I' il do it!
- Yes, but after sunset...
Silence!
And Duloc will finally have the perfect king!
Captain!
Assemble your finest man.
We' re going to have a tournament!
That' s it, that' s, right there, that' s Duloc.
I' ve told you I' il find it.
That must be lord Farquaad' s castle.
Aha, that' s the place.
Do you think maybe he' s compensating for something.
Hey, hey wait up Shrek!
- Hey, you!
- No, no!
Wait a second.
Look, I' m not gonna eat you.
I just...
It' s quiet.
Too quiet.
Where is everybody?
Hey look at this.
Wow!
- Let' s do that again.
- No. no.
Sorry about that.
That champion should have the honor, no, no...... the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely princess Fiona from the fireing keep of the dragon.
And so on, and so forth.
Some of you may die, but it' s a sacrifice I' m willing to make.
Applause.
Let the tournament begin.
What is that?
Ugh, it' s hideous.
Oh, that' s not very nice.
It' s just a donkey.
Indeed.
Knights!
New plan.
The one, who kills the Ogre, will be named champion.
How about him.
Now, come on.
Can' t we just settle this over a pint?
No?
All right then.
Come on.
Hey Shrek!
Let me, let me!
The chair!
Give him the chair!
Thank you, very much.
Try the wheel!
No.
I have a better idea.
People of Duloc.
I give you our champion!
What?
Congratulation, Ogre.
You' ve won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest.
Quest?
I' m already on a quest.
A quest to get my swamp back!
- Your swamp?
- Yeah, my swamp!
Where you dumped those fairytale creatures.
Indeed.
All right Ogre, I' il make you a deal.
Go on this quest for me and I' il give you your swamp back.
Exactly the way it was?
Down to the last slime covered toast tool.
- And the squatters?
- As good as gone.
What kind of quest?
We gonna go find the dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back the swamp, which you only don' t have, 'cause he filled it with full of freaks on the first place.
- You know what?
Maybe there is a good reason, donkeys shouldn' t talk.
I don' t get it Shrek.
Why didn' t you just pull some old Ogre stuff on them?
You know the whole Ogre trick.
Maybe I could have decapitated entire village and put their heads on plate.
Got a knife, cut open their spleens and drink their fluids.
Does that sound good to you?
A, no, not really, no.
- Example.
- Example?
OK, A- a- m, Ogres are like onions.
- They stink?
- Yes, no.
- No.
Oh, you leave them out on the sun and they get all brown and start??? little wild hairs?
Onions have layers.
Ogres have layers.
Onions have layers.
You get it?
We both have layers.
O, you both have layers.
You know not everybody likes onions.
Cake!
Everybody loves cakes.
Cakes have layers.
I don' t care what everyone likes.
Ogres are not like cakes.
Have you ever met a person and you say:
"Hey, let' s get some paffe" and they say I don' t like paffe.
Paffe is delicious.
No!
You tensed, irritating, miniature peace of barden.
End of story.
Bye, bye.
See you lather.
Paffe is maybe the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet.
You know I think I' ve preferred your humming.
Do you have a tissue or something, 'cause I' m making a mess.
Just the word paffe has made me start slimying
Why, Shrek, did you do that?
Man you got to warn somebody before you just crack one off.
My mouth was opened and everything.
Believe me donkey, if it was me, you' d be dead.
It' s brimstone.
We must be getting close.
I know what I smell and??? no brimstone.
Sure it' s big enough, but look at the location.
Oh, Shrek, remember when you said that Ogres have layers?
Oh, yeah.
Well, I have a confession to make.
Donkeys don' t have layers.
We wear??? sleeves.
Wait a second.
Donkeys don' t have sleeves.
- You know what I mean.
- Oh, you can' t tell me you' re afraid of highs.
No, I' m just a little uncomfortable of being on a rickety bridge over boiling lake of lava!
Come on donkey, I' m right here beside you.
Ok?
For emotional support.
We' il just hackle this thing together one little baby step after time.
- Really?
- Really really.
Ok.
That makes me feel so much better.
Just keep moving and don' t look down.
Don' t look down, don' t look down.
Shrek!
I' m looking down!
Just let me off right now, please.
- But you' re already half way.
- Yeah, but I know that half is safe.
You go back.
Shrek, no, wait.
Don' t do that!
Oh, I' m sorry.
Do what?
- Oh.
This?
- Yes, that!
Yes, yes.
OK.
- No, Shrek!
- I' m doing it.
I' m gonna die.
I' m gonna die.
Shrek, I' m gonna die.
That will do Donkey, that will do.
Cool.
So where is this fire breathing pain in the neck anyway?
Inside.
Waiting for us to rescue her.
I was talking about the dragon Shrek.
- Are you afraid?
- No, but shhhhh.
Oh, good.
Me neither.
Because there' s nothing wrong with being afraid.
Here' s a..., something responsible of the situation.
And there' s dragon that breathes fire.
I' m sure he' s meaner than a cow or anything, but they' re scare.
You know what I mean.
I' m sure he' s heavier than a cow...
Donkey.
Ok?
Shut, up.
Now go over there and see if you can find any stairs.
Stairs?
I thought we were looking for the princess.
The princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest tower.
What makes you think she' il be there?
I read it in a book once.
You handle the dragon, I' il handle the stairs.
That' s right.
Those stairs won' t know which way they go.
I' m the stair master.
I' m master of the stairs.
I wish I had a stair right here right here now, I' d step all over it.
Well, at least we know where the princess is.
- But where is the...
- Dragon!
Donkey, look out!
Got you.
Oh, what large teeth you have.
I mean, white sparkling teeth.
You probably hear this all the time from your food, but you must bleach yourself, because that is one dashing smile you got there.
And do I detect the hint of minty freshness?
And you know what else?
Oh, sure.
I mean 'course you' re a girl dragon,' cause you' re just ricking the feminine beauty out.
What' s the matter with you?
Do you have something in your eye?
I don' t know if we would worked out.
You' d be blowing smoke and stuff.
Shrek!
No, Shrek!
Shrek!
- Wake up!
- What?
Are you princess Fiona?
I am.
Awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me.
Oh, that' s nice.
Now let' s go.
But wait, sir knight.
Should not be wonderful, romantic moment?
Yeah.
Sorry lady there' s no time.
Hey, what are you doing?
You know, you should sweep me out of my feet.
Out through the window and down the rope by to your valued steed.
You' ve had a lot of time to plan this, haven' t you?
But we have to sing through this moment.
Or something.
I don' t think so.
Well, can I at least know a name of my champion?
Shrek.
So, Shrek.
I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude.
Thanks.
- You didn' t slay the dragon?
Now, come on!
But this isn' t right.???
Yeah.
Right before they burst in the flame.
That' s not the point.
Wait.
Where are you going?
Exit is over there.
Well, I have to save my ass.
What kind of knight are you?
One of a kind.
... rush into a physical relationship.
Magnitude.
Hey, that is unwanted physical contact.
Hey, what are you doing?
Ok, ok, let' s just back up a little and take this one step at the time.
I mean, we really should get to know each other first, you know what am I saying.
As friends, maybe even as???
That' s ma personal tail.
And you' re going to tear it off....
No!
- It talks?!
It' s getting to shut up, that' s a trick.
Ok, you two.
Head for the exit.
I' il take care of the dragon.
Ruuuuun!
You did it.
You rescued me.
Amizing, you' re wonderful.
I' m entirely in your debt.
And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed.
I hope you heard that.
She called me a noble steed.
She thinks I' m a steed.
The battle is won.
You may remove your helmet good sir knight.
- Aah, no.
- Why not?
Please.
I wouldst look upon the face of my rescuer.
Oh, no, you wouldn' t, dust.
What?
That wasn' t in a job description.
- No.
It' s destiny.
You must know how it goes.
A princess locked in a tower and besieged by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight.
And then they share true love' s first kiss.
With Shrek?
You think, wait...... you think Shrek is your true love?
Well, yes.
You think that Shrek is your true love.
What is so funny?
Let' s just say, I' m not your type, ok?
Of course you are.
You' re my rescuer.
Look.
I really don' t think this is a good idea.
- I' m not going to.
- Now!
- Ok, easy.
As you command your highness.
You' re an Ogre.
Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.
Well, yes, actually.
Oh no.
This is all wrong.
You' re not supposed to be an Ogre.
Princess, I was sent to rescue you by lord Farquaad, ok?
He' s the one, who wants to marry you.
Well, then why didn' t he come to rescue me?
Good question.
You should ask him that, when we get there.
But I have to be rescued by my true love.
Not by some Ogre and his pet.
Well so much for noble steed.
Look princess.
You' re not making my job any easier.
Well I' m sorry, but your job is not my problem.
I' il be waiting for him right here.
Hey, I' m no ones messenger boy, all right?
- I' m a delivery boy.
- You wouldn' t dare.
- Put me down!
Yeah, I' m right behind you.
Put me down or you will suffer the consequences.
This is not dignified.
Put me down.
Ok, here' s another question.
But you don' t get burned to a crisp neither.
How do you do this?
Just tell her, she' s not your true love.
Everyone knows it what happens when you find...
Hey!
The sooner we get to Duloc, the better.
You gonna love it there princess.
It' s beautiful.
What' s he like?
Well, let me put it this way, princess.
Men of Farquaad' s stature are in short supply.
There are those who think little of him.
Stop it, both of you.
You know, you' re just jealous that you can never measure up to a great ruler like lord Farquaad.
Well maybe you' re right princess.
But I' d like you do that measuring when you see him tomorrow
Tomorrow?
It will take that long?
- Shouldn' t we stop to make camp?
That would take longer.
We can keep going.
But there are robbers in the woods.
Whoa, time out Shrek.
Camp is definitely something that sounds good.
I' m scarier than anything we' re gonna see in this forest.
I need to find somewhere to camp, now!
Hey, over here.
Shrek, we can do better than that.
Now, I don' t think this is decent for princess.
No, no, it' s perfect.
It just needs a few homey touches.
Like what?
A door.
Well, gentleman I' il be d..., good night.
I said good night!
Shrek!
What are you doing?
I just..., you know...
Oh, come on, I was just kidding.
And that one, that' s Throwback.
The only Ogre to ever spit over three wheat fields.
Right.
Hey, can you tell my future form these stars?
Well, the stars don' t tell the future, Donkey.
Look.
There' s Blodna, the "Flatulent"
You can guess what he is famous for.
Now I know you' re making this up.
No.
Look.
There he is and there' s the group of hunters running away from his stag.
Man, there ain' t nothing, but a bunch of little dots.
You know donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear.
Forget it.
What are you gonna do when we get our swamp back, anyway?
- You know.
When we' re through rescuing the princess and all that stuff.
We?
There' s no our.
There' s just me and my swamp.
And the first thing I' m gonna do, is build a ten foot wall around my land.
You cut me deep Shrek, you cut me real deep just now.
I think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody out.
No, do you think?
- Are you hiding something?
- Never mind Donkey.
Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn' t it?
No.
This is one of those drop it and leave it alone things.
- Why don' t you want to talk about it?
- Why do you want to talk about it?
- Oh, Why you block?
- I' m not blocking.
- Oh yes you are.
- Donkey, I' m warning you.
Who?
Everyone, ok?
- Oh, now we' re getting somewhere.
- Oh, for 'the love of pit'.
Hey, what' s your problem Shrek?
What do you got against the whole world anyway?
It' s the world that seems to have a problem with me.
People take one look at me and go:
Run!
A big stupid ugly Ogre.
They judge me, before they even know me.
That' s why I' m better off alone.
You know what?
When we met, I didn' t think you' re just a big stupid, ugly Ogre.
Yeah, I know.
Are there any donkeys up there?
Well, there' s a Cabby.
The small and annoying.
I see him, now.
That one, over there?
That' s the moon.
Show me again.
Mirror, mirror, show her to me.
Show me the princess.
Perfect.
You know I like like that.
Oh come on baby...
- Donkey.
- What?
- Wake up.
Morning.
How do you like your eggs?
- Good morning princess.
- What' s all this about?
You know, we kind of got of to a bad start yesterday and I wanted to make it up to you.
I mean, after all, you did rescue me.
Thanks.
Well, eat up.
We' ve got a big day ahead of us.
- Shrek!
- What?
It' s a compliment.
Better out than in I always say.
But that' s no way to behave in front of a princess.
- Thanks.
- She' s as nasty as you are.
You' re not exactly what I' ve expected.
Well, maybe you shouldn' t judge people before you get to know them.
Princess!
What are you doing???? mon shery, for I am your saviour.
And I am rescuing you from this green... beast.
Hey!
That' s my princess.
Go find your own.
Please, monster.
Can' t you see I' m a little busy here?
Look, pal.
I don' t know who you think you are.
How rude that was.
Oh marry men!
Man, that was annoying.
Oh, you little...
Shall we???? all the forin???
Where did that come from?
- What?
That was amazing.
Where did you learn that?
Well, when one lives alone one has to learn these things in case there' s a...
What?
Oh, would you look at that.
Oh, no...
I' m so sorry.
- What' s wrong?
- Shrek' s hurt?
Shrek' s hurt!
Shrek' s going to die.
- Donkey, I' m ok.
I' m too young for you to die.
Turn your head???.
- Does anyone know how to handle...
Calm down.
If you want to help Shrek, run into woods and find me a blue flower with red thorns.
Blue flower, red thorns.
Blue flower, red thorns.
Don' t die Shrek.
And if you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light!
- Donkey!
Blue flower, red thorns.
- What are the flowers for?
- For getting rid of the Donkey.
Now, you hold still and I' il yank this thing out.
- Hey!
Easy with the yanking.
- I' m sorry, but it has to come out.
No, no.
It' s tender.
What you' re doing here is the opposite...
- Ok, look.
Ok.
What do you propose we do?
Blue flower, red thorns.
Blue flower, red thorns.
This would be so much easier if I wasn' t colorblind.
Blue flower, red thorns.
Blue flower, red thorns.
Hold on, Shrek.
I' m coming!
Not good.
It' s just about it.
Nothing happened.
We were just a...
Look if you want to be alone, all you had to do is ask, ok?
Oh, come on.
That' s the last thing on my mind.
The princess here was just...
Au!
Hey, what' s that?
Is that...
There it is, princess.
- Your future awaits you.
- That' s Duloc?
You' il shrink things lord Farquaad is compensating for something, which I think needs, he has a
I guess we better move on.
Sure, but Shrek...
I mean.
He doesn' t look so good.
- What are you talking about?
I' m fine.
- Well, that' s what they always say.
- You know she' s right.
You look awful.
- Do you want to sit down?
- You know, I' il make you up some tea.
Well, I won' t say nothing, but
I' ve got this twinge in my neck.
Au, see?
- He' s hungry.
I' il find us some dinner.
- I' il get the firewood.
Hey, where are you going?
Oh man, I can' t feel my thumbs.
I don' t have any thumbs!!!
I think I need a hug.
This is really good.
- What is this?
- Wheat rat.
- No kidding.
- Oh, this is delicious.
- Well, they also great in stews.
Now, I don' t mean to brag, but I make a mean wheat rat stew.
I guess I' il be dining a little different late tomorrow night.
I' il cook all kinds of stuff for you.
Swamp toast, soup fish, eye tartar.
You name it.
I' d like that.
- Ah..., princess?
- Yes, Shrek?
I was wondering.
Are you... a...
Are you gonna eat that?
Man, isn' t this romantic.
Just look at that sunset.
Oh, no.
It' s very late.
- What?
I see what' s going on here.
Aren' t you?
Yes, yes.
That' s, I' m terrified.
You know I' il better go inside.
Until...
I' m still afraid of the dark.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Now I really see what' s going on here.
Oh, what are you talking about.
Hey I don' t wanna even hear.
Look, I' m an animal and I got instincts.
I can feel it.
Oh, you' re crazy.
I' m just bringing her back to Farquaad.
Oh, come on, Shrek.
Wake up and smell the fairemones.
Just go in there and tell her how you feel.
Besides, even if I did tell her that... well you know.
I' m not saying that I do, 'cause I don' t.
She' s a princess and I' m...... an Ogre.
Yeah, an Ogre.
- Hey, where are you going?
- To get more firewood.
Princess.
Princess Fiona?
Princess, where are you?
Princess?
It' s very spooky in here and are we playing little games.
- No, no.
- Help!
Shrek!
Shrek!
- It' s ok.
- What did you do with the princess?
- Donkey, shhh.
I' m the princess.
- It' s me, in this body.
- Oh my god.
You ate the princess.
- Can you hear me?
- Donkey!
Listen, keep breathing.
I' il get you out of there!
Shrek!
Shrek!
Shrek!
This is me.
Princess?
What happened to you?
You' re a... different.
- I' m ugly, ok?
- Yeah.
Was it something that you ate?
'Cause I told Shrek those rats were a bad idea.
- No.
I' ve been this way as long as I can remember.
What do you mean?
Look, I' ve never seen you like this before.
It only happens when the sun goes down.
By night one way, by day another.
This shall be the norm until you find true love' s first kiss.
Then, take love' s true form...
- Oh, that' s beautiful.
I didn' t know you wrote poetry.
- It' s the spell.
When I was a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me.
Every night I become this.
This horrible ugly beast.
I was placed in a tower to await the day when my true love would rescue me.
That' s why I have to marry lord Farquaad tomorrow, before the sun sets and he sees me, like this?
All right, all right.
You' re not that ugly.
But you only look like this at night.
Shrek' s ugly 24/ 7.
And this is not how a princess is meant to look.
Princess.
How about if you don' t marry Farquaad?
I have to.
Only my true love' s kiss can brake the spell.
But you know, you' re kind of an Ogre.
Well you' ve got a lot in common.
Shrek?
How is it going first of all?
Good?
I' m ok.
I saw this flower and thought of you because it' s pretty.
And, well, I don' t really like it, but I thought you may like it, because you' re pretty.
A....
I' m in trouble.
Ok, here we go.
Who could ever love a piece so hideous and ugly?
Princess and ugly don' t go together.
That' s why I can' t stay here with Shrek, but only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love.
Don' t you see, Donkey?
That' s just how it has to be.
It' s the only way to break the spell.
Well, at least you' ve got tell Shrek the truth.
You can' t breathe the word.
No one must ever know.
You got to keep secrets.
Promise you won' t tell.
Promise!
All right, all right.
But you should.
You know, before this is over, I' m going to need whole lot of serious therapies.
Look at my eye twitching.
I tell him, I tell him not.
I tell him not.
I tell him!
Shrek!
Shrek!
There' s something I want...
Shrek.
Are you all right?
Never been better.
There' s something I have to tell you.
You don' t have to tell me anything, princess.
I heard enough last night.
- You' ve heard what I said?
- Every word.
I thought you' d understand?
Like you said, who could love a hideous, ugly beast!
- I thought that wouldn' t matter to you.
- Yeah, well, it does.
Princess.
I brought you a little something.
What I missed?
- Princess Fiona.
Now hand it over.
Very well, Ogre.
The deed to your swamp.
Take it and go.
Before I change my mind.
For I' ve never seen such a radiant beauty before.
- I am lord Farquaad.
- Lord Farquaad?
Oh, no, no... forgive me my lord for I was just saying short... farewell.
That is so sweet.
You don' t have to raise good manners on the Ogre.
- It' s not like it has feelings.
It doesn' t.
Princess Fiona, beautiful fair flawless Fiona,
I ask your hand in marriage.
Will you be the perfect bride for the perfect groom?
Lord Farquaad, I accept.
Nothing would make...
Excellent!
I' il start the plans for tomorrow we wedd...
No!
Why wait?
Before sunset.
The sooner, the better.
There is the camera, the cake, the band, the guests...
Round up some guests.
Farewell Ogre.
Shrek, what are you doing?
You let her get away.
- Shrek.
There' s something about her that you don' t know.
- I talked to her last night.
She' s...
- Yeah I know you talked to her last night.
You' re great pal, aren' t you?
Now, if you two are such good friend, why didn' t you follow her home?
- Shrek.
I want to go with you.
- I told you, didn' t I?
You' re not coming home with me.
I live alone.
My swamp, me and nobody else!
Nobody!
Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys!
I thought...
You know what?
You thought wrong.
Shrek.
Donkey?
What are you doing?
I was thinking of all the people, you would recognize a wall when you see one.
Well, yeah.
Not through it.
See?
That' s your half and this is my half.
Oh, your half?
Yes, my half.
I helped rescue the princess.
I get half the booty.
Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks like your head
- Back off!
- No.
You back off!
- This is my swamp.
- Our swamp.
- Let go, Donkey!
- You let go!
- Stubborn jackass.
- Smelly Ogre.
Fine!
Hey, hey, come back here.
I' m not through with you, yet.
- Well, I' m through with you!
You were always me, me, me.
Well, guess what?
Now it' s my turn!
So you just shut up and pay attention!
You are mean to me, you insult me, you don' t appreciate anything that I do!
You' re always pushing me around or pushing me away.
Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back?
Because that' s what friend do.
They forgive each other!
Oh, yeah.
I forgive you for stabbing me in the back!
You' re so wrapped up in layers, onion boy.
You' re afraid of your own feelings.
- See?
There you are, doing it again.
Just like you did it to Fiona.
Maybe even love you.
Love me?
A hideous creature.
- I heard that you two were talking.
- She wasn' t talking about you.
She was talking about...... somebody else.
She wasn' t talking about me?
Well then, who was she talking about?
No way, I' m not saying anything.
Right?
- Donkey.
- No!
I' m sorry, all right?
I' m sorry.
I guess I am just a big stupid, ugly Ogre.
Can you forgive me?
- Hey, that' s the friends are for, right?
- Right.
- Friends?
- Friends.
So?
What did Fiona said about me?
Why are you asking me for?
Why don' t you just go ask her.
The wedding!
We' il never make it in time!
Never fear!
For where there is a will, there is a way.
And I have I way.
Donkey?
- I guess this is just my act of magnetism.
- Oh, come here, you.
All right.
No one likes kissass.
Hold on tight.
I hadn' t have a chance to install seat belts, yet.
People of Duloc.
We gather here today to bear witness to reunion of our new king...
Excuse me.
Could you just skip ahead to "I do' s"?
Go on.
How about that?
Shrek, wait, wait a minute.
You want to do this right, don' t you?
- What are you talking about?
- It' s the line, it' s the line you got to wait for.
The priest is going to say:
"Speak now or forever hold your peace".
"I object".
- I don' t have time for this.
What are you doing?
Listen to me!
Look, you love this woman, don' t you?
- Yes.
- You want to hold her!
- Yes.
- Please her!
Then you got to, got to try a little tender love.
- All right.
When does this guy say the line?
We got to check it out.
And as so by the power of these two...
What do you see?
- I now pronounce you...
- There they go!
-... he all ready said it.
- Oh, for 'the love of pit'.
I object!
Shrek?
Oh, now what does he want?
Having a good time, aren' t you?
I love Duloc, first of all.
Very clean.
- What are you doing here?
But showing up uninvited to a wedding...
- Fiona!
I need to talk to you.
- Oh, now you wanna talk?
Well it' s a little late for that.
So if you' il excuse me.
- But you can' t marry him!
- And why not?
Because, because he' s just marrying you so he can be king.
- Outrageous!
Fiona, don' t listen to him.
- He' s not your true love.
- What do you know about true love?
- Well, I... I' m in...
Oh, this is precious.
The Ogre has fallen in love with the princess.
Shrek.
Is this true?
It' s preposterious.
Fiona, my love, we gonna kiss away for our happily ever after.
By night one way, by day another.
I wanted to show you before.
That explains a lot.
It' s disgusting.
Guards, guards.
I order you to get them out of my sight.
- Now!
Get them, both!
- No!
See?
- Shrek!
- No.
- Don' t just stand there, you dogs.
- Get out of my way.
No!
Shrek!
- And as for you my wife.
- Fiona!
I' il have you locked back in that tower for the rest of your days!
I will have order.
I will have potential.
I will have...
All right, nobody move!
I got a dragon here and I' m not afraid to use it.
I' m a donkey on the edge!
Celebrity marriages.
They never last, do they?
Go ahead Shrek.
- Fiona?
- Yes, Shrek?
I love you.
Really?
Really, really.
I love you too.
A time for true love' s first kiss...
Fiona?
Fiona?
Are you all right?
But I don' t understand.
I' m supposed to be beautiful.
But you are beautiful.
I was hoping this would be a happy ending.
God bless us, everyone.
The End.
Whoa, dude.
Crush?
Really?
OK, Crush.
I need to the East Australian Current.
E. A. C.?
Oh, dude.
You' re ridin 'it, dude!
Check it out!
OK, grab shell, dude!
Grab wh- a- a- at?!
Righteous!
- Yeah!
- Stop!
What brings you on this fine day to the E. A. C.?
Dory!
Is she all right?
Huh?
Oh, little blue.
She is sub- level, dude.
Dory!
Dory!
Dory.
I' m so sorry.
It' s my fault.
Twenty- nine, thirty!
Ready or not, here I come!
There you are!
Catch me if you can!
KlD:
Nice wave!
Whoo- hoo!
- Kill the motor, dude.
Let us see what Squirt does flying solo.
That was so cool!
Did you see me?
Did you see what I did?
You so totally rock, Squirt!
Noggin.
- Dude.
- Dude.
Oh... intro.
Jellyman, offspring.
- Jellies?!
Sweet.
- Totally.
Apparently, I must' ve done something you liked... dudes.
- Ow.
It' s awesome, Jellyman.
The little dudes are just eggs.
We leave 'em on a beach to hatch... and then, coo- coo- cachoo... they find their way back to the big ol' blue.
- Yeah.
But, dude, how do you know when they' re ready?
Well, you never really know.
Ha.
I know that dude!
It' s the Jellyman!
Go on.
- Turtle pile!
- Wait, wait, wait!
- Where' s your shell?
- I need to breathe!
- Are you running away?
Did you really cross the jellyfish forest?
- Did they sting you?
- One at a time!
Mr. Fish, did you die?
DORY:
So, where are you going?
You see, my son was taken.
- No way.
- What happened?
No, no, kids.
I don' t want to talk about it.
ALL:
Please?
Well, OK.
This is gonna be good.
I can tell.
And my son Nemo...
See, he was mad at me.
I don' t know.
Anyway, he swam out in the open water to this boat... and when he was out there, these divers appeared... and I tried to stop them, but the boat was too fast.
They couldn' t stop 'em.
And then Nemo' s dad... he swims out to the ocean, and they bump into...... three ferocious sharks.
Golly, that' s amazing.
And then dives thousands of feet...... straight down into the dark.
You can' t see a thing.
How' s it going, Bob?
And the only thing they can see down there...... is the light from this big, horrible creature... with razor- sharp teeth.
And then he has to blast his way...
So, these two little fish have been... searching the ocean for days on the East Australian Current.
Which means that he may be on his way here right now.
That should put him in Sydney Harbor...... in a matter of days.
I sure hope he makes it.
That' s one dedicated father, if you ask me.
Mine!
Mine!
Mine!
Mine!
Mine!
Mine!
Mine!
Mine!
Mine!
Mine!
You' re rats with wings!
Bloke' s been looking for his boy Nemo.
- Nemo?!
- He was taken off the reef...
- Take it!
You happy?
Mine!
Hey, say that again!
Something about Nemo.
Mine!
Mine!
Whoooa...
Mine?
Ho ho!
Brilliant!
Is he doing OK?
It' s OK.
I know who you' re talking about.
Gill?
Gill?
Hey, Sharkbait.
I' m sorry I couldn' t stop the...
No, I' m the one who should be sorry.
I was willing to put you in harm' s way to get there.
Nothing should be worth that.
I' m sorry I couldn' t get you back to your father, kid.
All right.
- What the...
- Aaah!
Huh.
Darn kids.
NlGEL:
You just missed an extraction.
Has he loosened the periodontal ligament yet?
Where' s Nemo?
- I' ve got to speak with him.
- What is it?
Your dad' s been fighting the entire ocean...
- My father?
Really?
He' s traveled hundreds of miles, battling sharks and jellyfish...
That can' t be him.
Some sort of sport fish.
- Tuna?
- Marlin?
Marlin!
The little clownfish from the reef.
It' s my dad!
He took on a shark!
I heard he took on three.
- That' s 4, 800 teeth!
After you were taken by Diver Dan over there... your dad followed the boat like a maniac.
Really?
He' s swimming, giving it all he' s got... and then three gigantic sharks capture him... and he blows them up and dives thousands of feet... and gets chased by a monster with huge teeth!
He ties this demon to a rock, and what' s his reward?
He gets to battle an entire jellyfish forest!
Now he' s with a bunch of sea turtles on the E. A. C... and the word is he' s headed this way right now... to Sydney!
- What a good daddy!
He was looking for you after all, Sharkbait.
- Sharkbait!
- Not again!
No!
You got your whole life ahead of you!
- We' il help you, kid!
- Get him out!
Come on, kid!
Grab the end!
Sharkbait!
- Can you hear me?
Nemo!
Can you hear me?
Yeah, I can hear you.
Sharkbait, you did it!
Ha ha!
That took guts, kid.
All right, gang, we have less than 48 hours... before Darla gets here.
- Jacques?
No cleaning.
- I shall resist.
Everybody else, be as gross as possible.
Think dirty thoughts.
- Good work!
- Ha ha ha!
Get ready!
Your exit' s coming up, man!
Where?
I don' t see it!
Right there!
I see it!
I see it!
MARLlN:
- That' s it, dude.
- Of course it is.
OK, first, find your exit buddy.
Yes!
Squirt give you a rundown of proper exiting technique.
Good afternoon!
We' il have a great jump today!
OK, crank a hard cutback as you hit the wall.
There' s a screaming bottom turn, so watch out!
Remember... rip it, roll it, and punch it!
He' s trying to speak to me, I know it!
Say the first thing again.
OK, Jellyman!
Go, go, go!
- Whoa!
Whoo!
That was... fun!
Hey, look, turtles!
CRUSH:
Most excellent!
Now turn your fishy tails around... and swim straight on through to Sydney!
No worries!
Thank you, dude Crush!
- Bye!
- Bye, Jellyman!
You tell your little dude I said hi, OK?
DORY:
Bye, everyone!
Hey!
Crush, I forgot!
CRUSH:
150, dude!
And still young!
150!
I gotta remember that.
- Yep.
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?
Yep.
We' re gonna just swim straight.
Dory...
DORY:
MARLlN:
DORY:
- It' s me.
- Right!
It' s orange and small...
It' s me.
All righty, Mr. Smartypants.
Me.
And the next one, just a guess, me.
- Wait, wait, wait.
I have definitely seen this floating speck before.
That means we' ve passed it before... and that means we' re going in circles... and that means we' re not going straight!
- Get to the surface.
We' il figure it out up there.
- Hey!
Relax.
- What?
Take a deep breath.
Fine.
Who do you want to ask, the speck?
- There' s nobody here!
- There has to be someone.
It' s the ocean, silly.
We' re not the only two in here.
Let' s see.
OK, no one there.
Nope.
Nada.
Excuse...
Dory, Dory, Dory!
Now it' s my turn.
I' m thinking of something dark and mysterious.
It' s a fish we don' t know.
If we ask it directions... it could ingest us and spit out our bones!
I don' t want to play the gender card right now.
Let' s play the "Let' s Not Die" card.
- Of course I do.
How are we gonna do that unless we give it a shot?
Come on.
Trust me on this.
Excuse me!
Whoo- hoo!
Little fella?
Hello!
Don' t be rude.
Ha.
- His son Bingo...
- Nemo.
- Nemo was taken to...
Sydney!
And it' s really, really important... that we get there as fast as we can... so can you help us out?
Come on, little fella.
Come on.
Dory, I' m a little fella.
Oh!
Big fella.
OK.
Maybe he only speaks whale.
Weee neeed...
- Dory?
What are you doing?
Are you sure you speak whale?
Can youuuu give us diiirectionsss?
Heaven knows what you' re saying!
- See, he' s swimming away.
He' s not coming back.
You offended him.
- Maybe a different dialect.
- Moooohhhmmooo...
This is not whale.
You' re speaking upset stomach.
- Maybe I should try humpback.
- Don' t try humpback.
Wooooooo...
- Maybe louder?
Rah!
Too much orca.
Didn' t it sound orca- ish?
It doesn' t sound orca.
It sounds like nothing I' ve ever heard.
- Oooooo!
He might be hungry.
Don' t worry.
They eat krill.
- KRlLL:
Swim away!
- Oh, look, krill!
- Aah!
Would you look at that?
Filthy.
Absolutely filthy.
You made it possible.
Jacques, I said no cleaning.
Look!
Scum angel!
I love the bubbles!
Has anybody seen Flo?
Hello, Barbara.
Sorry I' m late.
OK, here we go.
Here we go, OK.
Little Davey Reynolds...
Walks to the counter, drops the keys...
Bloat, that' s disgusting!
- Urrrp!
Here he comes!
NEMO:
Ohh.
- 10: 00, luv.
- Leave it open, would you?
I' ve gotta clean the fish tank before Darla gets here.
Yay!
We' re gonna be clean!
You ready to see your dad, kid?
- Uh- huh.
- Of course you are.
In the harbor waiting for you right now.
Yeah.
Come on!
You gotta try this!
- Will you just stop it?
- Why?
What' s wrong?
We' re in a whale, don' t you get it?
- A whale!
You had to ask for help!
And now we' re stuck here!
Wow, a whale.
I speak whale.
No, you' re insane!
You can' t speak whale!
I have to get out!
I have to find my son!
I have to tell him how old sea turtles are!
Hey... you OK?
There, there.
It' il be OK.
No.
No, it won' t.
Sure it will.
You' il see.
No.
I promised him I' d never let anything happen to him.
What?
You can' t never let anything happen to him.
Then nothing would ever happen to him.
Not much fun for little Harpo.
Don' t know.
I' il ask him.
- Dory...
- Whaaat' s goooing onnn?
Of course we' ve stopped.
Stop trying to speak whale.
You' il make things worse.
What is that noise?
Look what you did.
The water' s going down.
It' s going down!
You sure about that?
Look!
Already it' s half empty!
I' d say it' s half full.
Stop that!
It' s half empty!
OK, that one was a little tougher.
Of course he wants us to go there!
That' s eating us!
How do I taste, Moby?
Do I taste good?
Tell him I' m not interested in being lunch!
- Stop talking to him!
I' il check.
Whaaat...
No more whale!
You can' t speak whale!
- Yes, I can!
- No, you can' t!
You think you can do these things, but you can' t, Nemo!
Oof!
Everything' s gonna be all right.
How do you know?
How do you know something bad isn' t gonna happen?
I don' t!
Look!
Sy- d- ney...
Sydney!
Sydney!
Sydney again!
We made it!
We' re gonna find my son!
Wow.
I wish I could speak whale.
- Right!
- Come on, Dory.
We can do this!
It' s morning, everyone!
Today' s the day!
The tank is clean.
The tank is clean!
But how?
- What are we gonna do?
- What' s it say, Peach?
I can' t hear you, Peach.
Stop it!
The Aquascum is programmed to scan... your tank environment every five minutes?!
What does that mean?
PH balance... normal.
- Ooh.
Ooh...
That' s it for the escape plan.
It' s ruined.
Then what are we gonna do about...
ALL:
Darla!
- False alarm.
- Whew.
BLOAT:
- I' m thinking.
- Nemo!
I' m coming!
- Help me!
Help me!
Swim down!
Come on, kid!
- That' s it!
- What the...?
- Yay!
Gill!
- Sharkbait!
- Roll, kid!
- Lean!
Lean!
Gill!
Just calm down, Nemo.
You won' t go belly- up.
I promise.
You' re gonna be OK.
Darla!
No, but the boat has to be here somewhere.
Come on, Dory.
I' m totally excited.
Are you excited?
Dory, wake up.
Wake up, come on.
Duck!
That' s not a duck.
It' s a... pelican!
- Whoa!
I didn' t come this far to be breakfast!
Would you look at that?
What?
Sun' s barely up and Gerald' s had more than he can handle.
Reckon somebody ought to help the poor guy.
Yeah.
Don' t everybody fly off at once.
- Aah!
I gotta find my son Nemo!
Nemo?
He' s that fish!
I know where your son...
Wait!
Come back!
Stop!
Dory, keep going!
He' s crazy!
I got something to tell you!
Mine.
Don' t make any sudden moves.
Hop in your mouth?
How does that make me live?
NlGEL:
- Yeah, right.
I know your son.
He' s orange with a gimpy fin on one side.
Mine!
Mine!
DORY:
Mine!
Mine!
Mine!
- Aah!
Mine!
Too loud for me!
* Twinkle, twinkle, little star *
Find a happy place!
Darla, your uncle will see you now.
Raah!
I' m a piranha.
They' re in the Amazon.
DARLA:
Poor little guy.
- He' s dead.
Yay!
Fishy, fishy, fishy!
Must' ve left your present in the car, sweetie.
- Ohh!
- He' s still alive!
- He' s not dead!
What' s happening?
Why is he playing dead?
GlLL:
- He' s gonna get out of here!
- He' s gonna get flushed!
GURGLE:
Oh, no!
Not the trash can!
Nemo!
- Hey!
I found his dad!
- Where' s Nemo?
- He' s over there!
What' s a dentist?
Nigel, get in there!
- I can' t go in there!
- Yes, you can!
Charge!
- What the...?
Darla, sweetie, look out!
- Easy!
- Aah!
- Hold still!
Oof!
Gotcha!
Keep down!
Nemo!
Out with you!
And stay out!
Fishy?
Fishy!
Wake up!
Oh, no!
To the top of Mount Wannahockaloogie!
- Hurry!
- Bloat!
Ring of Fire!
Crikey!
Unh!
- Smack her in the head!
- Go, Gill, go!
Fish in my hair!
Gill!
Sharkbait... tell your dad I said hi.
DENTlST:
- I' m so happy!
- Is he gonna be OK, Gill?
Don' t worry.
All drains lead to the ocean.
Fishy!
Daddy!
I' m so sorry.
Truly, I am.
So, thank you.
Wait.
Where are you going?
It' s over, Dory.
We were too late.
Nemo' s gone, and I' m going home now.
No, you can' t.
Stop!
Please?
No one' s ever stuck with me for so long before.
I do.
Look...
P. Sherman, 42... 42...
It' s there.
I know it is because when I look at you...
I can feel it.
I' m home.
I don' t want that to go away.
I don' t want to forget.
I' m sorry, Dory, but I do.
- Sweet nectar of life!
Hey!
- Get outta here!
Just keep on swimmin '.
You got that.
Too right, mate!
I got a live one here!
Have you seen my dad?
Hey!
Come back here!
You let him go!
BOTH:
Dad!
Dad!
Are you all right?
I don' t know where I am.
I don' t know what' s going on.
I think I lost somebody, but I can' t remember.
I' m looking for someone, too.
Hey, we can look together.
I' m Dory.
Nemo?
That' s a nice name.
- Dad!
Wait a minute.
Is it your dad or my dad?
- My dad.
Dad!
- Where are we, anyway?
Oh.
Syl...
Shi...
Sydney.
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.
Aah!
You' re Nemo!
Yes, yes, I' m Nemo!
You' re Nemo!
You were dead.
I saw you.
And here you are!
I found you.
You' re not dead.
And your father...
You know my father?!
Where is he?
This way!
He went this way.
DORY:
Hey, hey, hey!
- It looks just like him!
- But bigger!
Yeah, I saw him, bluey.
But I' m not tellin 'you where he went... and there' s no way you' re gonna make me.
Aah!
All right!
I' il talk!
Hey, look out!
I' m sorry.
I' m just trying to get home.
NEMO, DlSTANTLY:
Dad!
- Daddy!
- Nemo?
- Dad!
- Nemo' s alive!
Dory?
Nemo!
Daddy!
Nemo!
I' m coming, Nemo!
- Dad!
- Nemo!
Thank goodness.
It' s all right, son.
It' s gonna be OK.
Turn around!
You' re going the wrong way!
Look out!
MARLlN:
Oh, my...
He- e- elp!
- Dory!
DORY:
Help!
Help!
Get us out!
No, no, no!
- Dad, I know what to do!
No!
We have to tell all the fish to swim down together!
- I know this will work!
No, I am not gonna lose you again!
There' s no time!
It' s the only way to save Dory!
I can do this.
I know you can.
- Lucky fin!
- Now, go!
Hurry!
Tell all the fish to swim down!
You heard my son!
Come on!
Swim down together!
Do you understand what I' m saying to you?
Swim down!
Everybody swim down!

Where' s Nemo?
- There!
Nemo!
Nemo?
It' s OK.
Daddy' s got you.
Oh, thank goodness.
Dad...
Oh, no, no, no.
I' m so sorry, Nemo.
- What?
Sea turtles...
I met one.
- 150?
- Yep.
Sandy Plankton said they only live to be 100.
Sandy Plankton?
- Ha ha ha!
Not 100!
Who is this Sandy Plankton who knows everything?
Time for school!
Let' s go!
- I' m gonna win!
- No, you' re not!
- I did it!
- Aw, my own son beats me!
Climb aboard, explorers.
The sea cucumber looks over to the mollusk and says...
"With fronds like these, who needs anemones?"
Who' s this?
- Exchange student.
- I' m from the E. A. C., dude!
- Sweet!
- Totally.
Seriously, Marty.
Did you really do all the things you say you did?
BRUCE:
- Hello.
Don' t be alarmed.
We wanted to make sure our newest member got home safely.
- See you next week.
- Keep up with the program.
- Remember, fish are friends...
Not food!
MR. RAY:
Hold on, here we go!
Next stop... knowledge!
Bye, son!
Have fun!
Bye, Dad!
Mr. Ray, wait.
I forgot something.
I love you, too, son.
You can let go now.
Go have an adventure.
- Bye, Elmo!
- Nemo.
- Bye, Nemo!
- See you after school, Dory!
Bye, son.
Barbara, I don' t understand it.
Here this thing has a lifetime guarantee... and it breaks!
I had to clean the tank myself, take all the fish out... put 'em in bags, and...
Where' d the fish go?
- Hurry!
- You can do it!
- That' s it.
Just a little further.
PEACH:
- Come on, Peach!
Aah!
Now what?
- Hi.
I' m sorry.
Wake up.
Okay, don' t worry about it, I' il get you out in a jiffy.
Keep holding your breath, little wormie.
- Yo, Lenny.
- I' m coming, Frankie.
Pop' s waiting.
And gotcha.
Now escape.
Just go.
Cry freedom.
- You almost gave me a heart attack.
- What are you doing?
I was just... picking you some flowers.
Hey, Mom said it' s not okay to hit.
Mom' s not here.
Don' t.
Don' t.
- That song gives me the creeps.
It' s our theme song.
Are they gone?
You sure?
Good morning, Southside Reef.
I' m Katie Current, keeping it current.
We' ve received official confirmation the sharks are gone.
The sharks are gone.
Is gonna be all right
Don' t worry
Tuna Turner.
Mussel Crowe.
Jessica Shrimpson.
Cod Stewart.
Up next, a mother of 800 tells us how she does it all.
But first, over to Janice for the traffic report.
Thanks, Katie.
There' s an overturned mackerel.
Get out those shell phones and call in to the boss, 'cause you' il be late.
My mother is your mother, okay.
It' s fake.
- Fake?
I worked eight years on that.
According to the latest Scallop Poll, fear of sharks is at an all- time high.
How long must this reef live under siege?
Is there no hero among us?
Who can stop this shark menace?
Hi, I' m Oscar.
You might think you know, but you have no idea.
Welcome to my crib.
The good life, the way the other half lives.
Check it out, I got my 60 "high- def, flat- screen TV with 6- speaker surround, CD, DVD, PlayStation hook- up and an 8- track player for days when you' re feeling a little...
'Cause even a superstar Mack daddy fish like me has to have the basic necessities.
Yeah, like money.
Come on, Shorties.
Why ya' il messin 'with my fantasy?
'Cause you so broke, your baloney has no first name.
That' s very funny.
Hey, Oscar.
I gotta talk to ya.
- Be right there.
Hang onto these.
Yo, doo.
Yo, Crazy Joe.
Now that you live in that penthouse, can I be your financial advisor?
That' s a billboard, Crazy Joe.
You live in a billboard?
And they call me crazy.
- Hey, Oscar.
Look who came to visit.
Don' t do that.
- Shouldn' t you be in school?
- Shouldn' t you be at work?
Right back at me, huh?
Little smart mouth.
Stay outta trouble, all right?
- See ya.
See ya, Oscar.
Yo, what' s up, fellas?
Big O' s in the house.
What' s up?
Reef side.
- Yo, Johnson, is it lunch yet?
- You just got here.
That' s my point.
Hey, Headphone Guy.
- Lookin 'good, ladies.
- Hey, Oscar.
Keep up the bad work.
I' m already punched in?
Angie.
Can I help you?
One wash and lube, please.
- Hot wax?
- Please.
Kelp scrape?
We' re having a special.
Why not?
It is mating season, and I' m feelin 'lucky.
Sykes' Whale Wash.
A whale of a wash, and the price... oh, my gosh.
Removes lines and salt damage.
- Good.
- Hey, Ang.
- Oh, my gosh.
- Thanks for covering for me.
Angie needs to get her freak on.
Thanks.
- Oscar.
Dance with me, mama.
Let me see it.
- Oscar.
You' re gonna get me fired.
Please, you fired?
That can' t happen.
'Cause then I would have absolutely no reason to come to work.
Oh, you don' t mean that.
Course I do.
You' re like my best friend.
Listen, tell me what you think about this.
This is like the best idea ever, all right.
It' s a sure thing, guaranteed cash extravaganza.
- Bottled water.
- Oh, no.
I mean, I am... pschoo!
Instead of getting in Mr. Sykes' face with another get- rich- quick scheme, go do something you' re actually good at:
Your job, which by some miracle you still have.
I almost forgot.
- I brought you some breakfast.
Kelpy Kremes?
Your favorite.
By the way, you' re still on hold.
Thank you for holding.
Busy, busy.
Go.
How can I help you?
Mr. Sykes is at a meeting right now.
He won' t be back till later.
How are my little babies this morning?
You doin 'good?
Huh?
You see, Sykes, it' s a fish- eat- fish world.
You either take or you get taken.
Truer words have never been spoken.
We done?
Now, you and me, we worked together a long, long, long time.
Please, Don Lino, it' s hardly been like work.
- You know...
- I love that about you.
Let me finish.
That I' ve lived my life for my sons.
- Raising and protecting them...
- You' re the best!
Am I right or am I wrong?
Am I right?
- It' s all been to prepare...
- Right?... to prepare them...
- Sorry.... for the day they run the reef.
Well, today is that day.
Luca.
Big Butts.
Long story short, from now on you work for Frankie and Lenny.
- Capiche?
But Lenny?
You can' t be serious.
I' m dead serious.
It takes more than muscle to run things.
Now Lenny, he' s got the brains.
That' s somethin 'special.
- He' s special all right.
- What does that mean?
- Nothing.
- I bring you in here,
look you in the eye, tell you what' s what, and what?
- What?
- What "what"?
You said "what" first.
I didn' t say what, I asked you what.
I said "What?"
No, I said "what what", like what what?
- You said "what" first.
- Now you' re making fun of me?
No, you misunderstood.
Lenny had an accident.
Lenny had an accident.
He was born.
You' re a comic genius.
Look, all I' m saying is the kid ain' t exactly no killer.
You hear me?
A cold- blooded killer.
Look at him.
That' s it!
You are out!
What?
Whaddya mean I' m "out?"
- You' re fired.
And on top of that, you' re gonna have to start payin 'me.
For what?
So nothing happens to your little Whale Wash.
Welcome to Oscar' s crib.
60- foot slime- covered tongue with canker sores, swim- in cavities, and plankton- encrusted teeth for when I feel a bit...
Old school.
Stop your moaning, Oscar.
It could be a lot worse, you know.
I could have this job and look like you.
Who' s behind me?
Whoever' s behind me better give me some.
Indigestion.
She' s gonna blow!
Wait!
Headphone Guy is still in there!
I got you, Headphone Guy!
- Yeah.
I could look like you.
Y' all funny.
Well, see if you laugh at this.
Soap in the eye!
You like that?
- All right, go ahead, big baby.
- Thanks, Oscar.
- Well, look who it is, Bernie.
- Just the fish we' re looking for.
- Right now.
My jellyfish brothers.
Hey, what' s up, man?
Man, it' s good to see y' all...
What' d you say, Ang?
Okay.
But don' t worry
That' s not the way you sing that song, mon.
Sykes, my brother from another mother.
What' s goin 'down?
Hey, baby, this is all gravy today.
Now snap your fin...
- You' re not snappin 'it...
Hey, don' t sweat it.
A lot of white fish can' t do it.
- Would you just sit down, okay?
I' ve been goin 'over my markers.
You' re into me for five grand.
- 5 G' s, okay?
Man, you trippin '?
Oh, yeah?
See if this refreshes your memory.
That' s crazy, look at that.
You wrote everything down so you wouldn' t forget.
You go, boy.
I have to pay Don Lino protection, so everything you owe me, you owe him.
- How you figure that?
The food chain.
See, on top there' s Don Lino.
There' s me, and there' s regular fish.
- That' s me.
- No.
There' s plankton, there' s amoebas...
- Then there' s me?
- I' m gettin 'there.
There' s coral, there' s rocks, there' s whale pooh, and then there' s you.
That' s messed up.
- What?
- Oscar.
Sorry.
- Easy, boss, find your happy place.
There is no happy place with him here.
I' m serious.
Okay, please.
Please, just gimme some time.
That' s all I' m asking.
I' m begging you, Sykes.
Please.
'Cause I like you, I' m gonna give you 24 hours to pay up.
How am I supposed to do that?
That' s your problem.
Bring my 5, 000 clams to the track tomorrow, or else.
- Or else what?
- The boys' il explain.
- Unpleasant.
5, 000 clams?
You borrowed 5, 000 clams from Mr. Sykes?
Oscar, why do you get yourself into these situations?
I don' t know, Ang.
It' s just hard, all right, because I' m a little fish in a big pond.
A really big pond.
The ocean.
I' m a nobody.
I want some of that.
- What?
It' s ladies' night, Oh, what a night...
That.
The top of the reef.
Where the somebodies live.
I wanna be rich and famous like them, but I' m stuck down here.
Well, what' s wrong with down here?
I' il tell you what' s wrong with down here.
Remember my dad?
He worked at the Wash his whole life.
He was the number one tongue scrubber.
Every year for 25 years.
To me, working at the Wash was the coolest job in the ocean.
But then I learned something I will never forget.
Oscar' s dad' s a tongue scrubber!
Tongue scrubber!
But nobody loves a nobody.
I want to be a somebody.
Oscar, you don' t have to live at the top of the reef to be a somebody.
If I don' t pay Mr. Sykes back by tomorrow...
I' m dead anyway, so...
Wait here.
What' s this?
- A pink pearl?
Where' d you get that?
My grandmother gave it to me.
She said it started from a tiny grain of sand, but then, after a while, it grew into something beautiful.
- No.
No, I couldn' t...
- Take it.
It' il get you the money you need for Mr. Sykes.
What do you mean, you don' t understand?
I don' t want to have to say it again.
You' re really giving me agita.
You see something, you kill it, you eat it.
Thanks.
That' s what sharks do.
That' s a fine tradition.
What' s the matter with you?
Your brother Frankie, here, he' s a killer.
- Thanks, Pop.
- He' s beautiful.
He does what he' s supposed to do.
Wipe your face.
But you...
I' m hearin 'things.
You gotta understand, when you look weak it makes me look weak.
- I can' t have that.
- I know, Pop, I' m sorry.
Lenny.
Look at me.
This handin 'over the business, it' s for you, for both of yous, and you' re acting like you don' t even want it.
I need to know that you can handle that.
Right here, in front of me now, eat this.
- Yeah.
I' m on a diet.
You know how many calories are in one of those shrimps?
A lot.
It' s true.
It' s true and the other thing is, my sister had a baby and I took it over because she passed away and then the baby lost its legs and its arms and now it' s nothing but a stump but I still take care of it with my wife and it' s growing and it' s fairly happy, but it' s difficult 'cause I' ve been working a second shift at the factory to put food on the table, but all the love I see in that little guy' s face makes it worth it in the end.
True story.
Eat it!
Have mercy.
- Pop, please...
- Eat!
- No eat.
Son, eat the shrimp!
No, please.
- Lenny!
Pop!
Put the shrimp down!
Get out of here.
- You' re free, now go.
- Thank you.
You' re a good person.
Come on, fellas.
No.
We' re gonna do this as a family.
Frankie, I want you to take Lenny out, show him the ropes.
- You' re gonna learn how to be a shark.
Whether you like it or not.
That kid better show up or he' s dead meat.
Just say the word, boss.
Carrying a big ol 'envelope full of money, gonna give it to Mr. Sykes.
Hurry up.
This is our chance, we don' t want to miss it.
- You sure?
- My trainer friend tipped me off.
The race is rigged.
We can' t lose.
- What' s the horse' s name?
- Rich!
Top of the reef, here I come.
What am I doing?
Remember what Angie said.
What did Angie say?
Dreams can begin small.
You just have to... bet it all.
And Lucky Day wins.
Five thousand on Lucky Day to win.
That' s 200 to one.
That would pay a million clams.
The millionaire.
Lucky Day.
Lucky Day.
Nice bet.
- You got a name?
- You wanna tell me what it is?
Well, mine' s Lola.
C' mon, man!
Get your game face on!
Lola, my name' s...
My name is Oscar, sweetie.
Mrs. Sanchez.
The hippity- hop smooth talk don' t work with me.
My bad.
Hey, so...
Oscar.
I was starting to think you skipped out on me.
Sykes!
I see you' re already on your way to the concession stand.
What are you doing?
Mind bringing us back some drinks?
That would be great, thanks.
And some of them little wiener thingies.
- The ones with the toothpicks?
- Don' t listen to him.
- Let me escort you to... my box.
- Your box?!
His box?!
You can' t even afford the gum under the seats.
He just laid five grand on Lucky Day.
I think he can afford anything he wants.
My five grand?!
- No, it was another five grand.
- Hold up.
- Gimme that!
- Clearly I' ve made a mistake.
Lola!
Deep down, I' m really superficial.
And don' t get me wrong, you' re cute, but... you' re a nobody.
Oscar, you cute, but you' re a nobody.
Come back.
I' m not a nobody.
I' m a wiener.
You' re in trouble up to your gills and still you' re askin 'for more.
Now go on, get in here.
Oscar, you better pray that this horse of yours comes through.
Hey.
You, outta my seat.
Unbelievable.
- Sit tight and watch the race.
- With your good eye.
The horses are at the post.
And they' re off!
Fish Fingers, then Seabiscuit and Salmonella.
Lucky Day seems to be having trouble getting out of the gate.
- Only a sucker would bet on that horse.
He does this all the time.
He' s playin '.
What' s this?
Lucky Day is now crashing his way through the gate, and he' s off and running.
Please, Lucky Day.
Go fast.
Coming around the turn it' s Seabiscuit by a length and Lucky Day well behind.
And here comes Lucky Day, coming up from behind, passing Yellow Tail, Salmonella.
Go.
Around the final turn, here comes Lucky Day.
Lucky Day' s now caught up to Fish Fingers.
They' re head to head.
Neck to neck.
I' m tired just thinkin 'about countin' all of this money.
It' s Lucky Day.
What happened?
Lucky Day is down.
No.
Here' s Fish Fingers, followed by Seabiscuit, Yellow Tail...
- And Fish Fingers wins.
I just want to hold you.
Let me see, will ya?
Remember your "happy place", Sykes.
Yo, that was crazy, right?
Who knew?
Everything' s set, it' s a lock, we good to go, we in the money, and he trips underwater.
Who in the halibut trips underwater?
- That' s it.
That' s it, I' ve had it.
Find the deepest hole in the ocean and when you do, dig deeper.
It' s just business.
- Yeah.
Sykes, he like you, mon.
Him say take it easy on you.
- But Sykes is not here.
- True.
Yeah, mon?
Why is it that me locks can sting other people, but they have no effect on me or you?
Ernie.
I didn' t mean it, Ernie.
Ernie, you made a joke.
Good one, man.
Frankie, you know I can' t do this.
If you wanna make Pop happy, you' ve gotta kill something.
Or, I could find an old, sick fish and just wait.
It' s gettin 'around, your thing at the restaurant.
You know how fish talk.
Boom.
Forget it, you' re dead.
Okay, seriously, I can' t understand wise guy so be more specific.
Specific?
Be a shark for once in your life.
- What am I gonna do?
- Lenny, forget about it, okay?
We do a couple of practice runs, badda- bing badda- boom, Pop' s happy, you' re a shark, life goes on.
Capiche?
Okay.
Okay, capiche.
Bingo.
Right there.
You see it?
Don' t get easier than this.
All right.
Eye of the tiger.
Frankie, I can do this.
What if I can' t do this?
- Then don' t bother comin 'home.
All right.
Hit him in the tail again.
- Yeah.
- Blow out.
Guys?
Don' t leave me alone.
Come on, there could be sharks out here.
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
- What?
Just get it over with.
Do me a favor, don' t chew me.
- I' m not for that.
- I' m not gonna eat you.
Don' t do the whole head trip thing with me.
Don' t move until I tell you.
That' s it, Len.
There you go, buddy.
That' s it.
Wave those fins, baby.
Look, I' m just pretending so you can get away.
Now, when I turn around, you take off.
Tastes just like chicken.
- What did I tell you?
- I' m sorry, I didn' t get it.
- Just go.
I' ve had it up to here.
- Oh, no.
- Hurry, swim.
- No, Frankie, wait.
Frankie.
- Lenny, is that you?
- I' m here, Frankie.
- Come closer.
- Yes, what is it?
I' m so cold.
That' s just because we' re cold- blooded.
- Moron.
Frankie, no...
No!
This is all my fault.
I' m so sorry, Frankie.
How am I ever going to explain this to Pop?
What the...
We' re sorry.
It was all Ernie' s idea.
Did you kill that shark?
Uh... yeah.
Exactly how it look, that' s how it is.
What happened?
You wanna know what happened?
You' re standing on top of a shark.
Go on, man.
Well, I' il tell you what happened.
Big ol 'shark, about 75, 100- feet long.
- Razors.
And I was, like, you' re gonna come at me like that?
You' re gonna come at the "O" like that?
Do the muscle thing, the muscle thing.
Oh, right.
And I pointed like this.
And he lives right over here.
And I think it' s time for a little family reunion.
You see, mon.
I told you.
We were right there.
Pardon me.
- Move it!
- Oh.
- She seems so nice on TV.
- Oscar, Katie Current.
Does this mean you' re now protector of the reef, new sheriff in town?
Katie, I' m gonna keep it real.
- I can call you Katie?
- Of course.
Any shark try to mess around in Oscartown is goin 'down.
In the heat I get poetic.
Get out of here, you barracudas.
Any further questions will be fielded by me.
- And you are?
- I' m his manager.
- Sykes, with a "y".
- And I' m his financial advisor.
You want to see my puppets?
Could you excuse us for a moment, please?
- My manager?
- Kid, you' re a superstar.
- We' re gonna make a fortune.
- What about the 5 G' s?
Forget the 5 G' s.
We' re partners now.
- So what are we talking about?
- I' m thinkin '90- 10 split?
- That' s generous.
- You' re the 10, I' m 90.
- You get 15.
- 70.
- 20.
- 75.
Dude, you' re goin 'the wrong way.
50- 50.
- You happy?
- No.
- No.
- Deal.
My manager and I are now prepared to take your questions.
Oscar, are you going to continue working here at the Wash?
Please, I barely work here now.
No.
He' s slayin 'sharks.
Hey, that' s good.
That' s good, I like that.
Oscar the Sharkslayer.
A sharkslayer.
From now on, any shark tries to bother this reef, it' s his funeral.
- To Frankie.
It' s a terrible thing, Don Lino.
Everybody loved Frankie.
May his stinking, maggot- covered corpse rot in the fiery depths of hell.
Thank you for your kind thoughts, Giuseppe.
Hope he' s okay.
Oh, Lenny...
- Don' t worry, boss.
- I said some things to him...
We gotta find him.
We' re searching everywhere.
Forget about it, he' il turn up.
What' s wrong with that kid?
Why' s he gotta be so different?
Frankie, God rest his soul, he was perfect.
Oh...
Oh...
Don Lino, at this most difficult time, please accept my deepest condolences.
Thank you, Don Feinberg, for honoring my son with your song.
I got some news, about the guy who took out Frankie.
Yeah, let' s talk over here.
Calls himself "The Sharkslayer".
Ira, over here.
- Sorry.
"The Sharkslayer".
- Where do I find him?
That' s all we could dig up.
Thank you.
- Any requests?
- Luca.
- That Titanic song?
Get Sykes.
He knows that reef better than anybody.
I wanna find this guy.
I wanna know about him, where he lives, where he sleeps.
I wanna know about it.
Who is this Sharkslayer?
Here he is.
The Sharkslayer.
Let' s get this party started right.
There he is, the big O.
- Sykes.
Pound it.
Raise the reef, buddy.
Hot.
Yeah, that' s pretty...
- Angie, you made it.
- Wait, you' re gonna break my gift.
You didn' t have to get me anything.
What' d you get me?
What does every bachelor pad need?
A lava lamp?
How did you know I love lava lamps?
You know what, I' m gonna put it right here next to my other one.
Hey, come on, Ang.
I wanna show you the best thing about this place.
- How great is this view?
- Top of the reef.
- I know.
It' s beautiful, right?
- Like you...
Like you... your new apartment.
It' s... wow.
What I' m trying to say is that I' m proud of you.
It was nothing, really, you know.
Don' t move.
Girl, you are gonna flip.
- I' m back.
- You' re back.
All my dreams comin 'true...
Well, I never could' ve done it without you.
Oh, sure you could.
Well, probably not.
Here.
Oscar!
I know.
I' m just sorry that it took so long.
That' s okay.
My grandmother' s pearl.
With interest.
- and I never forget who my friends are.
Ang, I...
I' m not interrupting something, am I?
- No.
You' re here.
You, er, you gotta come best my meet friend, Angie.
Uh, uh, eat my best men, Wangie...
Your best friend?
Oh, that' s sweet.
So you won' t mind if I steal him for a while, will you?
So, look who' s a somebody after all.
- Well, you know...
On the... on the edge of the reef!
They' re great whites!
Okay, everybody go home to your loved ones, spend the last few hours that you have with each other.
That' s the way it used to be around here.
We' d have been all scrambling for cover and stuff,
- but not since Oscar came to town.
So, Lola, baby, just wait here and I' m gonna be right back.
I' m gonna go take care of these sharks.
- Go get 'em, tiger.
Biceps, triceps.
- Go get 'em, Oscar.
Lenny.
Where the heck is he?
Lenny!
What are you doin '?
You wanna be next?
Lenny?
Lenny?
- That was close.
- Super close.
Don' t panic.
We' re safe.
- Oh, no, not you again.
What was that?!
What is with you, man?
He could be anywhere.
- Who?
The Sharkslayer.
- There' s no sharkslayer out here.
- Yes, there is.
Trust me on this one.
Get a hold of yourself, man.
This is no time to act crazy.
You the one acting crazy, crazy.
You' re right.
I' m sorry.
I haven' t been myself since the... the, uh...
No, no, it' s not all that.
Just relax.
It' s my fault... kinda... not really... but still.
My brother...
Look, things' il work out.
- You think?
- Yeah.
And you should just go home, okay?
- Okay.
- Hey, good luck, dawg.
- Wait.
- What, man?
- I didn' t catch your name.
- I' m Lenny.
Hi.
Where do you live?
Lenny, where I come from, fish don' t like to get grabbed by sharks.
- Sorry.
- Go home.
There is no home for me now.
Don' t you understand?
- You too big to be grabbing on me.
- Take me home with you.
You won' t even notice I' m there.
I' m like the invisible shark.
Are you crazy?
Don' t leave me alone.
Put your fins on the wall where I can see 'em.
- Hey.
Yo, The Shorties.
- What y' all doin 'here?
- Check out my mad burner.
How ya like that?
Hey, y' all kids got some skills.
What did I tell you?
You kids shouldn' t be doin 'this.
And besides, it' s not safe to be out here at night.
Yeah, bro- bro.
- Sharkslayer?
- What was that?
Sometimes I be coughin 'for nothin'.
I need you off these streets, seriously.
Get your butts home.
I' il tell your moms y' all doin 'bad stuff.
- Yeah.
- Bye, Oscar.
- See ya later, doo.
Did you see what just happened there?
They think you' re the Sharkslayer.
As if.
I don' t appreciate your funky tone, actually.
No, wait up.
Hey.
I' m sorry, seriously.
I don' t want you mad at me, and I certainly don' t want you to slay me.
You' re having a good time?
You' re enjoying yourself?
Well, for your information, I am the Sharkslayer.
That' s what people be sayin '.
- Wait.
You mean, you...
When the anchor...
Oh, you' re a liar.
Hey, I didn' t lie, all right?
But it was a little lie.
Come on, who' s it gonna hurt anyway?
Man, I' m not explaining myself to you.
- You' re on your own.
And if, God forbid, someone should, I don' t know, find out the truth about the Sharkslayer on my way back...
- You wouldn' t.
- I would.
Come here.
Of course you can come with me.
But, you know, you' re a shark, right?
And I' m a Sharkslayer, so we can' t be seen together.
- You dig, dog?
Dog dig.
Yeah, yo diggy dog.
Just come on.
OK, Lenny, follow my every move and don' t make a sound.
You got it.
Ooh, an echo.
Echo.
It' s not okay to hit.
It' s not okay to hit.
- Get your tail in there.
- Do you think anybody heard that?
Who?
Hey.
Yo.
Crazy Joe.
I thought I heard something.
Did you get that shark?
You have no idea, Joe.
That' s great.
My show' s on.
All right.
We' re safe.
Ahh.
Oh, yeah, that' s good.
That' s heaven, yeah.
Snuggly, buggly, wuggly.
I love you, man.
- You' re my new best friend.
Stop it.
OK, you wanna be friends?
But we gotta lay down some rules.
Whatever that just was.
You got it.
Rule number two, and this is the most important rule.
In the event that possibly you get hungry...
Don' t worry, I won' t eat anyone.
If you haven' t noticed, I' m different from other sharks.
Let' s put it that way, leave it at that.
Good night.
- Define "different".
- You' il laugh.
I' m not gonna laugh.
That' s what you say, and then what happens?
Lenny, I give you my word.
I' m...
I' m a vegetarian.
Hold up.
- So that' s it?
What do you mean, that' s it?
You' re the first fish I ever told.
I' m tired of keeping it a secret.
And my dad, he' il never accept me for who I am.
What' s wrong with me?
Nothin 'is wrong with you, man.
I think all sharks should be like you.
God, that' s sweet of you to say.
And stop blaming yourself for what happened.
Really?
If you wanna blame anybody, blame me.
If I hadn' t been there in the first place, none of this would' ve happened.
Jeez, if Pop knew that, he' d ice you for sure.
"Ice".
What' s he, the Godfather or something?
- Yeah.
- Whatcha mean, "yeah"?
- Yeah, he is.
Hey.
I told ya.
- I' m doing it.
X, circle, X X, double left square, right trigger, down, square, square.
- Double square.
- Respect.
I' ve got news for you.
The Sharkslayer made me his manager.
So I' m now, what I like to call, untouchable.
You hear me?
- Sykes.
- Hey, Oscar.
Sykes?
Hey, there he is.
My brotha, my player, the Sharkslayer.
- Whatever.
Listen...
- Now you' il have to pay me protection.
The deal is off.
That shark I killed was Don Lino' s son.
- I know.
Ain' t it great?
- Not if he finds out.
What do you mean?
He' s on the phone right now.
That' s right, I got the Sharkslayer right here in front of me.
And he' s gonna slay you and all your sharks.
Shut up!
Hey, that' s good, I like that.
- Shut up, Lino.
- What?
Kid, he wants to talk to you.
I' m not here.
Yeah, he' s right here.
- Hello.
- Shut up?
- You don' t tell me "shut up".
- Hello?
- How you doin '?
Give me a pie with everything on it.
Anchovies, meatballs...
- Luca.
- Hi, Boss.
- Why you working in a pizza joint?
- Get off the phone!
- But I' m hungry.
My guys are coming for you, Sharkslayer.
They' re gonna tear you fin from fin.
Who takes care of you?
Come on, you two, we got work to do.
- Mon, I was winning.
You got it all wrong.
They' il write songs about you.
- With his teeth, dear
Sykes, man!
- Come on.
- Maybe I can help.
Hey.
Lola?
What' re you doing here?
You just be poppin 'up, sometimes, places.
- Well, you said to wait, so...
I' ve been waiting.
Look, I don' t have a lot of time for the hand- clappy makin '- the- lights- go- off music- playing- in- the- dark thing.
- What are you afraid of?
- Afraid...
Yeah, that' s funny.
I ain' t afraid of nothin ', it' s just...
Oh, baby, you are so tense.
Yeah, I' ve been stressed lately, you know, protecting the reef.
I do that by myself, you know.
- It' s just crazy.
- It' s too much, it' s piling up...
Actually, I was thinking about retiring.
- You don' t want to do that.
- I don' t?
You have worked your way to the top.
You don' t want to go back to the bottom, do you?
No.
No.
No way.
You just show 'em who' s boss and those sharks will leave you alone.
Yeah, you' re right.
Lenny.
Lenny?
Where are you?
Hello, Oscar.
Angie.
Hey, what are you doing here?
What, did you forget something?
Oh, maybe you forgot your shark.
Hi.
Shark!
Swim, Angie, I' il cover you.
Quick, before it' s too late.
Oh, stop it.
Your pet shark here told me everything.
Dang, Lenny, why would you do that?
I don' t know...
I like you, too.
What were you thinking, bringing him in here?
No, I' m still working out the kinks.
You lied.
Everybody thinks you slayed the shark.
- Who am I to tell them they' re wrong?
Don' t take it personally.
All right, look, I' m sorry.
I totally betrayed you, but listen, I got just one little problem I gotta take care of.
- Oh, what' s that?
- Sharks are coming to get me!
And they should.
You' d take credit for killing a shark, and then everything would be fine and dandy for the rest of your life?
Uh... yeah.
Me and Lenny got it.
We gonna fix it.
I don' t want any part of this.
They' re lookin 'for you, too.
Point taken.
What' s the plan?
- This is what we gonna do.
- Here' s the plan.
You tell the truth.
And, you, go home.
All right, look, this is what we' re gonna do.
A mess, right?
Then you gonna swim out and meet the sharks before they get here.
And you' re gonna say, "Stop.
"That Sharkslayer' s crazy, man!"
"He beat me senseless.
He' s a stone- cold killer, man! "
Tell 'em I' m handsome.
- You are going way too far.
Actually, he hasn' t gone far enough.
Exactly.
What?
You need to slay a shark, and I need to disappear.
Here' s what we' re gonna do.
Katie Current, reporting live.
- We' ve had unconfirmed reports of a...
It' s the Sharkslayer.
Holy mackerel.
Did we get that?
Oscar' s on the TV.
Show me that.
Go ahead with your bad self.
Do you hear them, Lenny?
They are goin 'crazy, man.
They hate me.
I can be the Fishslayer.
Come on, man.
You sell this, you' il never have to go home again.
You can start a new life.
Now gimme a growl.
- Like that?
- That was... pretty good.
Let' s go.
Is that all?
Do you understand how huge my client is?
Turn on your TV.
Lenny.
Turn off your TV.
Don' t swallow.
- No, it' s Pinocchio.
Of course it' s me.
- Why did you do that?
"Sorry" is when you step on somebody' s fin at the movies.
"Sorry" is when you say, "When' s the baby due?"
And it turns out the person' s just fat.
This is as far away from "sorry" as you could possibly get.
But, Oscar, I think I' m gonna puke.
Lenny, just open up.
Nice and easy.
Are you not entertained?
You can' t handle the truth.
You had me at hello.
Turn your TV back on.
Why are you turning your TV off?
This reef is huge.
How we supposed to find the Sharkslayer?
This is it, Lenny.
Just like we practiced.
- The flying fish?
- The flying fish.
A little help here, buddy boy?
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
Curse you, Sharkslayer.
Yeah, and you tell Don Lame- o that I don' t never, ever, ever, never, want to see another shark on this reef again.
Remember this name.
Oscar the Sharkslayer.
You see?
Look at Oscar.
Hey...
Seems The Sharkslayer not only conquered a few sharks today, but maybe a few hearts?
Has the reef' s most eligible bachelor been snapped up?
I' m Katie Current, here live, watching the Sharkslayer making out.
Hey, Angie, can you hand me the blue one?
Thank you.
Look who stepped in the room!
Oscar and Lenny.
What a team, baby.
Give me that, give me some fin.
High fin.
Low fin.
Yo, did you see me?
I was like...
I was crazy.
When you punched me, and the crowd was...
Yeah, they ate it up.
You didn' t know I had it in me, did you?
- It was like an Oscar- splosion.
- You was the bomb.
- Thank you.
And hey, hey, hey, Casanova.
I saw your big finish on the news.
Nice smooch, lover boy.
Lxnay on the isskay, man.
Private?
The entire reef saw you do it.
Hey, somebody' s in a bad mood.
C' mon, Ang, lemme see that smile.
- Show me the smile, baby...
- What has gotten into you?
- Me?
I swear, sometimes I wanna take your big dumb dummy- head, and just...
Ang, what is the problem?
Problem?
I don' t have a problem.
Miss Perfect is the one with the problem.
Hey, you guys...
- Not my lips, that' s for sure.
- What' s goin 'on?
- I' m gonna stay outta this one.
Why would you even care about Lola anyway?
- I don' t.
- You don' t.
- No.
- No what?
- You wanna...
No!
Just tell me, Oscar, 'cause I' m curious.
Why do you think she' s interested, huh?
Do you think for one minute that she' d even be with you if you weren' t the famous Sharkslayer?
- Please, don' t fight.
- Are you blind?
She treats me like I' m somebody.
- Would she love you if you were nobody?
- Nobody loved me as a nobody.
I did.
Before the lie.
To me you were a somebody, Oscar.
A sham.
A con.
You' re a joke.
Here I come...
Sebastian the Whale- Washin 'Dolphin.
- Angie...
- No, forget it.
I' m tired of hearing how everything you had in your life wasn' t good enough.
Including me.
- Angie?
- Oh, Honey, I' m sorry.
Go, go back and do it again.
Hey, come on.
It' il be OK.
You can' t handle the truth.
You' ve got Shark Breath.
What you kids doing?
How many times I have to tell you?
It' s past your bed time.
What are you kids up to?
You should do this for a living.
Preparation "O".
It slays hemorrhoids like Oscar slays sharks.
Hey, Oscar.
Angie was right.
I am a joke.
Hey, Sharkslayer.
Why are you out here?
All your friends are inside.
You mean that little bottom feeder from the Whale Wash?
Forget about her.
She' s a nobody.
No, I' m the nobody.
She told you that she loves you.
Is that it?
It' s not like you feel the same way about her.
You know, I don' t think this is gonna work out.
Wait, are you dumping me?
Let me explain something to you.
We' re gonna party like it' s your birthday
- Ha!
I love you and nobody else...
- I can' t talk.
I need to tell her I love her.
Way to go, Oscar.
Whale Wash, where you...
Whale Wash, where you...
- Where you get a whale of a wash...
- Gimme the phone.... and the price is very, very low, considering how good the wash is.
How many times do I have to tell you?
It' s "gosh."
"You get a whale of a wash, and the price, oh, my gosh."
- Me gets it, man.
- Rhymes with gosh.
Gimme that.
Go be useless someplace else.
Go be useless someplace else.
- Sykes, where' s Angie?
Whale Wash, you get a whale of a wash...
It' s for you.
Hello?
- Is this the Sharkslayer?
- Yeah, who' s this?
It' s Luca the Octo...
I mean, forget about it.
Now you follow these instructions to the letter, OK?
Top drawer.
There' s a package.
That' s right, tough guy, we' ve got your girl.
There' s a sit- down in one hour.
- Who is it?
Be there, if you don' t wanna see her sleepin 'with the fishes.
The dead ones.
Now, nod your head if you understand.
Now, tell me if you nodded your head.
I nodded.
They got Angie.
And they want a sit- down.
I never meant for anybody to get hurt, especially not Angie.
This is all my fault.
Classic move.
I' ve seen it a thousand times.
They take the thing you love the most, and then they use it against you.
We gotta go to that sit- down and we gotta save her.
Look, I wanna save Angie, too, but I can' t waltz in and say, "Hi, Pop.
I' m a dolphin. "
- And the Sharkslayer' s a fake.
Fake?
We' re gonna need a better plan than that.
This is a joke, right?
Because I told Lino...
Shut up, Lino.
Tell me that' s not Lenny.
- Tell me you' re a real Sharkslayer.
- I' m sorry, Sykes, I' m not.
But the sharks don' t know that.
Will you stop screwin 'around?
This' il never work.
Thank you, Sykes.
My man Sykes just begged me not to murder- lise all y' all up in here.
Now, I might listen to him, but then again I might not.
And that depends on the individual behavior of all the individuals in here, individually.
Ain' t that right?
Look, he' s got dolphin muscle.
My uncle Vito got whacked by one of those.
Now which one of you sardines called this meeting?
- That would be me.
So, this is the Sharkslayer.
I' ve been lookin 'forward to meeting you.
I feel like we' re practically family.
Funny, ain' t it?
I brought my kids into the world, full of love and care, and you took them out.
Do you know who I am?
I' m the Don.
The boss of the Great White Sharks.
Hey, boss, I saved you a seat.
I' ve been runnin 'this reef since before you was born.
And if you thought a guy like me can' t get to a guy like you...
You thought wrong.
Man, you the one who' s wrong.
I barely even know that girl.
What' s your name, miss?
Well, I say he' s bluffing.
- Marone, if I wasn' t married...
- How ya doin ', pretty lady?
Lola.
You know, Sharkslayer, there' s only one thing I like better than money.
Revenge.
I' m in love.
Your sharkslayin 'days are over.
And there ain' t nothing you can do about it.
- Huh?
You got nothing.
Sebastian, take her out.
OK, new rules.
Nobody, I repeat, nobody, makes a move without my OK.
I am the Panama Canal, baby.
From now on, everything flows through me.
What' d he do?
I can' t see it.
You don' t lose a tooth, you don' t grow one back without my OK, OK?
If you sneeze, you don' t wipe that boogie without my OK, OK?
OK.
And you don' t say "OK" without my OK.
OK, thank you all for coming.
One more thing.
What' s with all y' all living in the Love Boat?
- Y' all are supposed to be the mob.
- Get yourselves a real hideout.
And take a good look, Lino.
It' s over.
You' re old school.
- Oscar.
The horror.
Um... excuse me.
- No, I' m not OK.
He ate me...
The taste was killin 'me.
Lenny?
Is that you?
You' re alive?
What are you wearing?
What is that?
Boss, it' s Lenny.
He was wearing a disguise so we wouldn' t recognize him, but now he' s not wearing a disguise, so we do recognize him.
- Hi, Pop.
Are you kiddin 'me?
Are you outta your mind?
Do you have any idea how this looks?
This is the best sit- down I' ve ever been to.
What are you doing with him?
He took out your flesh and blood, Frankie.
- But, Pop, listen...
You never take sides against the family.
Hey, Don.
Sir.
It' s not his fault.
This is between you and me.
What did I ever do to you?
You took Frankie away and you turned Lenny into a dolphin.
- Oscar, look out.
- Oscar, swim.
You' re gonna regret the day you became the Sharkslayer.
Look who' s stuck in the porthole.
You still hungry, big guy?
Well, say hello to my little friends.
- Try it again.
Oh, my gosh.
All right.
You got it right.
Everybody out of the way.
Come on, Lino, it' s time to clean up your act.
Pop, leave him alone.
All right, Lino.
Game' s over.
- Lenny?
What are you doing in there?
- Sorry.
- He' s right behind me, isn' t he?
- You' re mine now.
Let' s finish this, Sharkslayer.
Oh, we' re about to.
- Thank you for coming to Whale Wash.
OK, somebody needs to get me out of the bubble.
- Today.
- The Sharkslayer does it again.
This time, luring two sharks into his death- trap of hygiene.
Oscar, you' re the somebody everybody wants to be.
Tell our cameras how it feels to be you.
- Angie.
I need a head start to get as far away as possible.
- Look what you did to him.
- It' s a misunderstanding.
Over here.
Stop!
I am not a real Sharkslayer!
- I lied.
And I' m not a real financial advisor.
OK.
It was an anchor that killed Frankie.
I didn' t have anything to do with it, and neither did Lenny.
If that was true, why did you run away?
Because you always wanted me to be like Frankie.
I' il never be the shark you want me to be.
What is your problem?
So your son likes kelp.
So his best friend is a fish.
So he likes to dress like a dolphin.
Everybody loves him just the way he is.
Why can' t you?
Don' t make the same mistake that I did.
I didn' t know what I had until I lost it.
Will you get me outta this so I can hug my kid and tell him I' m sorry?
Pop.
Come here, you.
I love you, Son, no matter what you eat, or how you dress.
Angie?
Angie, I wish I knew now what I knew then.
I mean, I wish you knew what I knew,
I mean, before this...
- You' re blowin 'it, man.
It' s emotional and it' s pressure.
What I' m saying, I just...
I didn' t need the top of the reef.
Everything I wanted was right there in front of me the whole time.
Well, what about being a somebody?
I' m nobody without you.
You' re not helping.
Come here, you big dumb dummy- head.
I never told you two this, but you' re the best henchman a guy ever had.
C' mon, group hug.
Sorry, man.
Come, Sykes, try again, mon.
Forget it.
So, uh, Lino...
Uh, Don...
Walk the streets, you know, without... aaah!
Yeah, we' re cool.
Excuse me.
You' ve lost everything you lied so hard to achieve.
Tell me, what' s next for you?
Come on, everyone' s waiting, Mr. Manager.
All right, I just gotta put the finishing touch on my new desk.
- Yo, dog.
- Sykes.
All right, partner, let' s see what you can do.
Sykes and Oscar' s Whale Wash is now open for business.
Let' s get this party bumpin '.
It' s E and B on the wheels of steel.
Yo, Christina.
Missy.
How about we have a little Oscar- licious fun?
- At the car wash - Sing it with me...
Hey, Angie, sorry Pop and I are late, but we brought some new customers.
Wow.
OK, guys, come on in.
- No, snap it.
You' re not snapping it.
I' m snapping it.
- A lot of great whites can' t do it, yo.
- Yo, what' s up?
- Up with what?
- I' m gonna yo you.
- Sorry.
- OK, doo, I pimped your hide.
- All right.
You think this is funny?
What am I, a clown to you?
Car wash
Sharks in the water Make theirjaws lock
When I swim through the grim I' m too hot
- I' m one big catch - Sharkslayer
- What you got?
- You don' t want none of this.
Break it down, fellas.
You got served.
Workin 'at the car wash, yeah
Now keep it comin '
Mr. Frank.
Kraler.
Miep.
My good friends.
It is so good to see you home.
We had heard nothing.
I' m alone.
You must come home with us...... and rest now.
- You must stay with us.
No, I can' t stay in Amsterdam.
Mr. Frank, this is your home.
- Amsterdam is your home.
Everywhere.
Even seeing you and Mr. Kraler....
I shouldn' t talk to you like this, after all you did.
Why, we' d do it again.
The book....
They took everything, except some papers.
We saved your letters and papers.
Burn everything.
I told her...... if I got back here, I' d find her book.
Anne' s diary?
It' s where she left it.
"The 9th of July, 1 942." 1 942.
Only three years ago?
"Dear Diary, since you and I are to be great friends...... I will start by telling you all about myself.
I am 1 3 years old.
I was born in Germany, but since my family is Jewish...... we emigrated to Holland when Hitler came to power.
Things went well for us until the war came and the German occupation.
Then things got very bad for the Jews. "
You could not do this and you could not do that.
We had to wear yellow stars.
I had to turn in my bike.
I couldn 't go to the movies or ride in an automobile...... or even on a streetcar.
And a million other things.
But somehow, we children still managed to have fun.
This morning, Father woke me at 5: 00...... and told me to hurry and get dressed.
We were going into hiding.
I was to put on as many clothes as I could.
It would look too suspicious if we walked along carrying suitcases.
We were going to disappear...... vanish into thin air.
I' m living a great adventure.
We had never met them.
VAN DAAN:
Mother.
VAN DAAN:
Will you stop that?
Father.
We' re here.
Hello.
Peter.
We took the long way around.
My wife, Edith.
Mr. and Mrs. Van Daan.
Oh, and this is our son, Peter.
So, now, please let us take off some of these clothes.
EDlTH:
Morning, Mr. Kraler.
That is good.
- Please, don' t even think of it.
We' il have leisure to arrange everything ourselves.
- Brought sandwiches for lunch.
The canned goods are here, and your beans and potatoes.
- Ration books?
If they see our names on ration books, they' il know we' re here.
Don' t worry.
It won' t be your names that' il be on them.
The Westertoren!
No!
You must never touch a curtain.
No one must ever touch a curtain, day or night.
If someone on the streets should look up or someone should see...... we would be lost.
Remember, it' s not only our lives at stake...... but Miep' s and Mr. Kraler' s.
Thank you.
Miep or I will be up each day to bring you food and news.
- Goodbye.
Goodbye, Mr. Kraler.
EDlTH:
I never thought I' d live to see the day when a man like Mr. Frank...... would have to go into hiding.
When you think of it....
PETRONELLA:
Thank you, Mr. Kraler.
Anne!
- It' s all right, I have on three more.
Excuse me, Mr. Frank.
- Before workmen come.
Now...... while the men are in the building below, we must be quiet.
Every sound can be heard down there, in the offices and in the workrooms too.
They leave at about 5: 30.
So to be perfectly safe, from 8 a. m. until 6 p. m...... we must move about up here only when absolutely necessary...... and then in stockinged feet.
We must not speak above a whisper or run any water.
We cannot use the sink or even, forgive me, the W. C.
The pipes go down through the workrooms.
No trash must ever be --
Not even a potato peeling.
We must burn everything in the stove at night.
This is the way that we must live until it is over, if we are to survive.
Until it is over.
After 6: 00, we can move about.
We can talk and laugh...... have our supper, read, play games, just as we would at home.
Now it would be wise if we all went to our rooms...... and were settled before 8: 00.
Mr. and Mrs. Van Daan, you' re upstairs.
But he' il be here, near us.
- And where am l?
- You and Margot will be in there.
FRANK:
Oh, no, no.
We' il sleep down here.
I' ve thought this out.
It' s the best arrangement.
The only arrangement.
Edith?
You didn' t close your eyes last night.
Now, go in the girls' room.
- Well, how about Anne?
- I feel fine.
I' m going to help Father.
This way, Mrs. Van Daan.
Up here.
- Mr. Frank?
ANNE:
You' ve a cat?
- You only have about five minutes.
- He couldn' t live without that cat.
I love cats.
What' s its name?
- Mouschi.
A him or her?
It doesn' t like strangers.
- Then I' il have to stop being a stranger.
PETER:
No.
You ought to have him fixed, to keep him from fighting.
What a nice cat.
Where do you go to school?
- Jewish Secondary.
That' s where Margot and I go.
- Yeah, I know.
- I' ve never seen you around.
- I used to see you sometimes.
- You did?
Why didn' t you ever come over?
I' m sort of a lone wolf.
You can' t be a lone wolf here.
I wonder what our friends will say when we don' t show up today.
I had a date with Sanne.
ANNE:
Sanne' s my best friend.
"Anne and Sanne, the skinny bananas."
PETER:
That' s right.
They' il arrest you if you go out without your star.
Who' s going out?
- Help me.
- I' m helping.
- What are you going to do with it?
It' s funny, I don' t think I could burn mine.
You couldn' t?
Something they make you wear so they can kick you around.
I know.
But after all...... it is the Star of David, isn' t it?
Annele, it' s almost 8: 00.
It' il be a long day.
This is fine.
You won' t forget to take off your shoes, will you?
Peter...... it' s nice to have you with us.
Yes, Mr. Frank.
See you later.
Did you know that he went to the same school that --?
It' s comforting that Mr. Kraler and his secretary...... are down there below us, in the office.
Our protectors, we call them.
I asked Father what would happen to them...... if anyone found out they were hiding us.
Father said they would suffer the same fate that we would.
We are over an old spice factory.
You can smell the spices all through the building.
I read A Tale of Two Cities through in that first day.
"It is a far, far better thing I do...... than I have ever done.
It is a far, far better rest that I go to...... than I have ever known.
It was the saddest book I ever read.
It is us, Miep and Kraler.
- This is the box you asked for.
- Thanks.
- I thought you' d gone out for a walk.
I didn' t talk.
MARGOT:
Mouschi!
Peter!
FRANK:
- You don' t have to whisper now.
- There you are.
- He' s such a nice cat.
Thank you.
You' re welcome.
Will you open it, please?
As a boarding house, a very peculiar boarding house.
Father, my film stars!
I was wondering where they were.
And Queen Wilhelmina.
How wonderful.
There' s something more.
Go on, look further.
A diary.
And I' ve always wanted one.
A pencil?
I' m going downstairs to get a pencil.
Doesn' t matter.
- Never?
I' m sorry, Anne, it isn' t safe.
- I see.
It' il be hard, I know that.
But always remember there are no walls, no locks...... no bolts that anyone can put on your mind.
As a matter of fact, just between us, Annele...... being here has certain advantages.
For instance...... remember that battle with your mother about overshoes?
You said you' d rather die than wear overshoes.
In the end, you had to wear them.
Now, for as long as we are here, you won' t have to wear overshoes.
Isn' t that good?
You won' t have to practice it.
I tell you...... this is going to be a fine life for you.
It' s an odd idea for someone like me to keep a diary.
Not only because I have never done so before...... but because it seems to me, neither I, nor for that matter anyone else...... will be interested in the unbosomings of a 13- year- old schoolgirl.
Still, what does that matter?
I want to write, but more than that...... I want to bring out all kinds of things...... that lie buried deep in my heart.
First of all, I expect I should be describing...... what it' s like to go into hiding.
But I don 't really know yet myself.
I only know it' s funny never to be able to go outdoors.
Never to run and shout and jump.
Wednesday, the 23rd of September, 1942.
The news of the war is good.
Stalingrad is still holding out.
The Russian offensive continues in the Moscow area.
- Whee!
- l 'm first for the W. C.
- Six o' clock, Margot.
School is over.
- Have you seen my shoes?
- What shoes?
- You' re gonna be sorry.
- Annie, dear.
- Wait till I get you.
I' m waiting.
Stop!
Peter!
Peter!
Peter, where are you going?
EDlTH:
Annie, dear...... you shouldn' t play like that with Pete.
Who wants to be dignified?
I don' t wanna be dignified!
You complain I don' t treat you like a grownup, but when I do, you resent it.
I only want some fun.
I don' t know what' s the matter with that boy.
He isn' t used to girls.
Isn' t two months time?
I could cry.
And what about Miep?
She' s usually so prompt.
- Margot, come and dance with me.
- I' ve got more work to do, Anne.
When we get out, we won' t remember a thing.
- Where is Peter?
With his cat.
He hasn' t finished his lessons, has he?
- Peter!
Your mother says to come out.
I' m giving Mouschi his dinner.
You know what your father says about wasting time with that cat.
- I haven' t looked at him since lunch.
- I' m only telling you.
I' il feed him.
- You stay out of here.
Is that any way for you to talk to your little girlfriend?
-... would you please not say that?
- He' s blushing.
- Please, I' m not, but --
Nothing to be ashamed of to have a girlfriend.
She' s only 1 3.
It' s just perfect.
Your father' s 1 0 years older than me.
Mr. Frank, I warn you...... if this war lasts much longer, we' re gonna be related.
I' m giving Mouschi his dinner.
I couldn' t live without my precious Mouschi.
You wonderful cat, you.
All right, Miss Quack- Quack.
- You!
You talk so much they call you Miss Quack- Quack.
You' re the most intolerable boy I ever met!
Anne, dear, you' re hot.
Are you all right?
- Mother, please.
- No.
There' s only one thing to do, watch carefully.
Prevent an illness before it comes.
Let me see your tongue.
- Mother, this is perfectly absurd.
- Anne, dear, don' t be such a baby.
Let me see your tongue.
Anne, you hear your mother, don' t you?
Come on, open up.
You' re all right.
I think there' s nothing the matter with our Anne that a ride on her bike...... or a visit with her friend Sanne de Vries wouldn' t cure.
Isn' t that so, Anne?
I keep wishing that Peter was a girl instead of a boy.
Then I' d have someone to talk to.
With all the boys in the world...... why did I have to get locked up with him?
EDlTH:
Is it someone?
PETRONELLA:
Maybe she got hurt.
I wish she' d get here.
I' m going crazy without cigarettes.
-... and "very good" in Latin.
- Yes, but how about algebra?
Well, I have a confession to make.
We' il leave it to Margot to correct.
- lsn' t algebra vile, Father?
- Vile.
- How did I do?
Anne, please.
Your French composition today, Margot, was just wonderful.
- Mrs. Van Daan, may I try it on?
- No, Annie.
But please be careful with it.
My father gave me this coat the year before he died.
He always bought me the best money could buy.
Mrs. Van Daan, did you have a lot of boyfriends before you were married?
It' s not courteous to ask personal questions.
I don' t mind.
Anneke, our house was always swarming with boys.
- When I was a young girl -- - Oh, no, not again.
Shut up!
One summer, we had a big house in Hilversum.
VAN DAAN:
When I was 1 7....
Well, we were wearing short skirts then, and I had such good- looking legs.
I may not be as pretty as I used to be...... but I still have my legs.
How about it, Mr. Frank?
We see them.
I' m not asking you, I' m asking Mr. Frank.
- Mother, for heaven sakes.
- Oh, I embarrass you too, do l?
I only hope the girl you marry has as good.
Anneke, my father used to worry with all the boys hanging around.
"lf any of those boys get fresh, you just say to him:
'Remember, Mr. So- and- So, remember, I am a lady.' "
Look at you, talking that way with her.
Don' t you know she puts it in her diary?
PETRONELLA:
I' m only telling the truth.
Haven' t you finished?
- No.
- Oh, the thinker.
Leave him alone.
A hopeless case.
Don' t talk like that.
It' s just you haven' t got anyone to help you...... Iike Father helps Anne and me.
But if l -- Well, if we could help....
What about it, Peter?
Shall we make our school coeducational?
Thanks, yes.
Yes?
Why didn' t I meet you before I met that one there?
I think it might be better if you went into your room, Peter, to work.
Excuse me.
Peter, you listen to Mr. Frank.
Mr. Frank is a highly educated man.
It' s after 8: 00.
- At least one of them should' ve come.
- They' il come.
Don' t worry.
I know something' s wrong.
Isn' t it bad enough here without you sprawling all over?
If you didn' t smoke, you wouldn' t be so irritable.
- Am I smoking?
- You already smoked all the cigarettes.
- Miep only brought me one package.
VAN DAAN:
You' re smoking up all our money.
Will you shut up?!
And what are you staring at?
I never heard grownups quarrel like that before.
I thought only children quarreled.
This isn' t a quarrel, it' s a discussion.
- I, rude?
- Annie, drink your milk.
What you need is a good spanking.
Remember, Mr. So- and- So, I am a lady.
You' re the most aggravating -- Why aren' t you nice and quiet...... Iike your sister, Margot?
Why do you show off all the time?
Men don' t like that in a girl.
A girl who cooks and sews and cleans.
I' d open my veins.
I am going to be remarkable.
-... to study music and art.
I' m going to be an actress or a writer or a dancer.
ANNE:
You clumsy little fool!
All ruined, and what do you care?
I could just kill you!
Only a coat.
Anne, you must not behave in that way.
Anyone can have an accident.
I mean the answering back.
They' re our guests.
You don' t hear Margot getting into arguments with them.
Try to be like Margot.
And have them walk all over me the way they do her?
I don' t know what happens to you, Annie.
If I had ever talked to my mother as you talk to me....
Things have changed, Mother.
People aren' t like that anymore.
"Yes, Mother.
No, Mother.
Anything you say, Mother. "
I' ve got to fight things out for myself.
Make something of myself.
Margot doesn' t --
"Why aren' t you like Margot?"
Everything she does is right, and everything I do is wrong.
You' re all against me, and you worst of all.
I don' t know how we can go on living this way.
I can' t say a word to Annie, she flies at me.
In a half an hour, she' il be laughing and joking.
And them.
I told your father it wouldn' t work with two families.
But no, no, he had to ask them.
MARGOT:
Father.
EDlTH:
EDlTH:
Is it Miep?
- At last, I' il have some cigarettes.
- Miep' s here.
I can' t tell you how sorry I am about the coat.
Don' t worry.
When Mr. Kraler comes, the sun begins to shine.
- Dirk is Miep' s fiancé.
He had to go into hiding in the country to escape a labor call- up...... but he has let me have the radio for you.
It gives us our eyes and ears out into the world.
The Axis forces in the Western....
MAN ON RADlO: -- ceaseless attacks by land and air forces are now in full retreat.
The 8th army continues to advance.
It' s good.
Now, let' s see what they have to say about the Nazis, huh?
Berlin.
Must we listen?
All right, Peter, that' s enough.
The Green Police, they' ve found us.
MlEP:
KRALER:
Bless them.
FRANK:
And Miep, yes.
- We had a visitor last night.
- A thief.
- Did you hear him?
- He was right under you.
In the office right under here.
We did not know.
We thought it was the police.
- Are you sure, Miep?
- You were, of course, quiet?
We hardly breathed all night.
It was close.
- Too close.
He went through everything, the desk and the files.
And he found the safe, but he could not get it open.
He' s looking for our ration card supply from the underground.
- Somebody knows.
They' il come back.
Get it out of here.
"Burglars do not come back.
The safe is gone. "
- Mr. Frank, I must talk to you.
- Maybe we should get rid of the radio.
Put it in the stove.
If the Green Police found that radio....
Then they' d find her diary.
Not my diary.
- Where is it?
If they find us, they might as well find the diary, the radio....
- Yes, I know.
But something has happened.
He begged me, could I find him a hiding place?
-... but could you take him in?
- Well, of course we will.
- His name is Jan Dussel.
I think I know him.
I think it' s fine to have him.
But, Otto, where are we going to put him?
Where?
- There' s so little food as it is -- - We can stretch the food a little.
- No, thank you.
I' il get my things out.
Mr. Dussel.
Don' t bump your head.
Come in, Mr. Dussel.
This is Mr. Frank.
- Mr. Otto Frank?
Thank you, Mr. Frank.
I leave you in good hands.
Mr. Dussel, I must return your coat.
- What can I say to thank you?
Without them, we couldn' t live.
Please.
- We simply don' t like the Nazis.
"Nobody' s going to tell us Dutchmen what to do with our damn Jews."
Goodbye.
- Thank you.
Mr. and Mrs. Van Daan.
My daughters, Margot and Anne.
Please, Mr. Dussel, sit down.
I' m dreaming, I know it.
Mr. Otto Frank here.
You' re not in Switzerland, then?
Someone said that you had escaped.
- And you' ve been here all this time?
Did Mr. Kraler warn you you won' t get much to eat here?
Three ration cards among the seven of us.
Now you make eight.
Mr. Van Daan, you don' t realize what' s happening outside...... that you should warn me of a thing like that.
Every day, hundreds of Jews disappear.
They search house by house.
Every day, children come home from school to find their parents gone.
Hundreds are being deported.
People that you and I know: the Hallensteins, the Wessels.
"Come to the station on such and such a day and hour.
Bring only what you can carry. "
If you don' t, they come drag you from your home...... and ship you off to Mauthausen, the death camp.
We didn' t know that things had got so much worse.
Forgive me for speaking so.
Do you know the de Vries?
They' re gone.
Sanne and I are in the same class.
Sanne is my best -- My best friend.
She returned home from school to find her parents gone.
She was alone for two days, and then they came and took her away.
Gone?
Yes, with all the others.
Oh, no.
People named Meyerberg, they lived near us.
- We should put this off.
I' m sure Mr. Dussel would like to get settled.
Would you take Mr. Dussel to his room now?
If you' il come with me, Mr. Dussel.
Forgive me if I haven' t expressed my gratitude.
This has been such a shock to me.
I always thought of myself as Dutch.
I was born in Holland.
My father was born in Holland, and my grandfather.
And now, after all these years....
If you will excuse me.
Mr. Kraler says that things are improving.
I like it better the way Kraler tells it.
Good night.
- Say good night!
- Good night, Mother.
Do you have any children, Mr. Dussel?
No, I never married.
DUSSEL:
No one.
How dreadful.
You must be terribly lonely.
I' m used to it.
I don' t think I could ever get used to it.
Didn' t you even have a pet?
- A cat or a dog?
No, no, I have an allergy to furbearing animals.
- Gives me asthma.
- Oh, dear.
Peter has a cat.
- He has?
We hardly ever see it.
- He keeps it in his room all the time.
- I' m sure it' il be all right.
- Well, I hope so.
No.
I seem to be able to get everyone' s back up.
Oh, I always get along very well with young people.
My patients all bring their children to me...... because they know I get along well with them.
So don' t you worry about that.
Thank you, Mr. Dussel.
Good night.
I' il be back.
Good night, Mr. Dussel.
Be careful.
Sanne?
Save me!
Don' t take me!
Stop it!
It' s all right.
Please, Mr. Dussel, turn on the light.
It was just a dream.
You' re here, safe, you see?
Yelling like that.
She' s endangering our lives.
Mr. Dussel, after all, Anne is not exactly a trained frontline soldier.
Please, Mr. Dussel, go back to bed.
She' il be herself in a minute or two, won' t you, Annie?
Hmph.
I' m going to the W. C., the one room where there' s peace.
Go back to bed now.
EDlTH:
Was it a very bad dream?
Perhaps if you told me?
I' d rather not talk about it.
Try to sleep, then.
- I' il sit right here beside you.
ANNE:
But I' d like to stay with you.
Very much, really.
I' d rather you didn' t.
Good night --
You' il be all right?
There' s nothing that you want?
Will you please ask Father to come?
Yes, of course, Anne, dear.
She asked for you.
Go to her, Otto.
She' s still trembling with fear.
[CRYlNG]
She pulled away when I leaned down to kiss her.
They broke down the door and tried to drag me out, the way they did Sanne.
All girls turn to their fathers at this age.
They give all their love to their fathers.
EDlTH:
You didn' t shut me out.
- Do you want me to read to you?
- No, just sit with me for a minute.
Was I awful?
- Do you think anyone outside heard me?
Now, lie down quietly so.
Now try to sleep.
I' m a terrible coward.
I' m so disappointed in myself.
I think I' m really grown- up...... and then something happens, and I run to you like a baby.
I love you, Father.
Annele.
You' re the only one I love.
I' ve been thinking about it for a long time.
It' s fine.
It' s fine to have you tell me that you love me...... but I' d be much happier if you said that you loved your mother as well.
She needs your help so much.
She doesn' t understand me.
Whenever I try to explain my views on life, she asks me if I' m constipated.
She' s crying.
She is in there crying.
Oh, Father, I was horrible, wasn' t l?
What' s the matter with me?
Don' t say it' s just a phase.
Help me.
There is so little that we parents can do to help our children, Annie.
We can only try to set a good example, point the way.
The rest you must do yourself.
ANNlE:
Really, I am.
Every night, I think back over all the things I did that day that were wrong.
Like putting the wet mop in Mrs. Van Daan' s bed.
And now this with Mother.
And I make up my mind never to do that again.
Never.
I may do something worse, but I' il never do that again.
I have a nicer side, Father...... but I' m scared to show it.
I' m afraid people will laugh at me.
So the mean Anne comes to the outside...... and the good Anne stays in the inside.
And I keep on trying to switch them around...... have the good Anne outside...... and the bad Anne inside.
It would be what I' d like to be.
If only....
She' s asleep.
Thursday, the 29th of October, 1942.
Mr. Dussel and I had a great battle yesterday.
According to him, nothing, I repeat, nothing, is right about me.
While he was going on at me, I thought:
"Someday, I' m going to give you such a smack...... that you 'il fly right up to the ceiling."
Why is it that every grownup thinks he knows the way to bring up children?
Particularly the grownups that haven 't any.
Monday, the 9th of November, 1942.
Wonderful news!
MAN ON RADlO:
Churchill spoke on the BBC from London.
Ah, this is not the end.
It is not even the beginning of the end.
No, but it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.
The British planes come over, day and night, on their way to Germany.
It' s just too much.
What will we do?
What will we do?
If they hit this house, your worries will be over.
That big explosion, an English plane fell right in this block!
VAN DAAN:
Just look at them.
The more planes they send, the sooner the war will be over.
- I don' t believe it' il ever be over.
Do you know what I' d like right now?
Oh, yes, please.
If you have it now, you won' t have any tomorrow.
- I don' t care.
- Neither do l.
Tea now or tomorrow morning?
- Tomorrow morning.
Sure.
I' il take mine now.
The skylight!
FRANK:
"Praised be thou, Lord, ruler of the universe...... who' s sanctified us with thy commandments...... and bidden us kindle the Hannukah lights.
Praised be thou, O, Lord, our God, ruler of the universe...... who wrought wondrous deliverances for our fathers in days of old.
Praised be thou, O, Lord, our God, ruler of the universe...... that thou hast given us life and sustenance...... and brought us to this happy season. "Amen.
Monday, the 7th of December, 1942.
The Hannukah holiday came early this year.
"We kindle this Hannukah light...... to celebrate the wonderful deeds wrought through the zeal...... with which God filled the hearts of the heroic Maccabees 2000 years ago.
They fought against indifference...... against tyranny and oppression, and they restored our temple to us.
May these lights remind us that we should ever look to God...... whence cometh our help. "Amen.
"I lift up mine eyes unto the mountains from whence cometh my help.
My help cometh from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
He that keepeth thee will not slumber.
He that keepeth lsrael doth neither slumber nor sleep.
The Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand.
He shall keep thy soul.
The Lord shall guard thy going out and thy coming in...... from this time forth and forevermore. "Amen.
May I have the hats, please?
- That was very moving.
- It isn' t over yet.
VAN DAAN:
There' s lots more.
EDlTH:
But always on Hannukah, everyone gives presents.
- Like our St. Nicholas Day.
St. Nicholas Day.
What kind of Jew doesn' t know Hannukah?
I remember particularly the candles.
The next night, three, and so on, until eight candles are burning.
When there are eight candles, it' s truly beautiful.
Each day, they got better and better.
We are all here, alive.
That' s present enough.
No, it isn' t.
Every second bastard born is fathered by a priest.
But in Utopia that couldn' t be.
For why?
- For there the priests are very holy.
- Therefore very few.
Is it anything interesting, Matthew?
- Bless you, sir.
- Bless you too, Matthew.
To be sure, we have some holy priests in England.
- Oh, name some.
- Brother James.
Man' s a simpleton.
It' s from Cardinal Wolsey.
What' s he want?
- Me.
- When?
Now.
In Hampton Court?
You won' t be there by midnight.
- The King' s business.
- Queen' s business.
Mistress Anne Boleyn' s business.
Well, it' s all the Cardinal' s business.
That' s very true.
And when the Cardinal calls, you all come running, day or night.
What is the man?
A butcher' s son.
Chancellor of England, too.
No, that' s his office.
What' s the man?
Surely, Your Grace, when a man rises so high and so swiftly...... we must think he was misplaced in his origins.
That, at least, was the opinion of Aristotle and....
A butcher' s son and looks it.
His looks, yes, I give you his looks.
What was that you said, Richard?
Nothing, Sir Thomas, it was out of place.
And Wolsey' s still a butcher.
And you' re a member of the King' s High Council, not an errand boy.
That is why I must go.
The Duke would go if the Cardinal called him.
I might.
I' il be back for breakfast.
Go to bed.
"Dear Lord, give us rest tonight, or if we must be wakeful, cheerful.
For Christ' s sake.
Amen. "
And bless our lord, the King.
- "And bless our lord, the King."
- Amen!
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Goodnight, Your Grace.
Keep clear of Wolsey, Thomas.
He' s a frightened man.
- Who is that?
- A young friend from Cambridge.
- What' s he want?
- What do they all want?
A position.
- Can you give him a position?
- Do you recommend him?
No.
- Sir Thomas.
- No.
- Did you recommend me?
- No.
Richard, I may have a position for you.
What position?
- Not now, Richard.
Tomorrow.
For you all, boatman.
Thank you, sir.
Sir Thomas.
Master Cromwell.
You opposed me in the Council this morning, Thomas.
Yes, Your Grace.
- You were the only one.
- Yes, Your Grace.
You' re a fool.
Thank God there is only one fool on the Council.
Why did you oppose me?
I thought Your Grace was wrong.
A matter of conscience.
You' re a constant regret to me, Thomas.
If you could just see facts flat on...... without that horrible moral squint.
With a little common sense, you could have made a statesman.
The King.
Where' s he been?
Do you know?
I, Your Grace?
Spare me your discretion.
He' s been to play in the muck again.
He' s been to Mistress Anne Boleyn.
More, are you going to help me?
If Your Grace will be specific.
You' re a plodder!
All right, we' il plod.
The King wants a son.
What are you going to do about it?
I' m very sure the King needs no advice from me on what to do about it.
Thomas, we' re alone.
I give you my word, there' s no one here.
I didn' t suppose there was, Your Grace.
Do you favour a change of dynasty?
Do you think two Tudors are sufficient?
For God' s sake, Your Grace!
Then he needs a son.
I repeat, what are you going to do about it?
I pray for it daily.
God' s death, he means it.
That thing out there, at least she' s fertile.
- But she' s not his wife.
- No, Catherine' s his wife...... and she' s barren as a brick.
Are you going to pray for a miracle?
There are precedents.
All right.
Pray by all means.
But in addition to prayer there is effort.
And my effort is to secure a divorce.
Have I your support, or have I not?
The Pope gave a dispensation, so that the King might marry...... his brother' s widow for state reasons.
We are to ask the Pope to dispense with his dispensation, also for state reasons?
I don' t like plodding, Thomas.
Well?
Then, clearly all we have to do is to approach His Holiness and ask him.
I think we might influence the decision of His Holiness.
By argument?
Argument certainly.
And pressure.
Pressure, applied to the Church?
The Church has its church property.
Pressure.
No, Your Grace, I' m not going to help you.
Then goodnight, Master More.
Let the dynasty die with Henry Vill and we' il have dynastic wars again.
Blood- witted barons ramping the country from end to end.
Is that what you want?
Very well.
England needs an heir.
Certain measures, perhaps regrettable...... perhaps not, there' s much in the Church which needs reformation, Thomas.
All right, regrettable.
But necessary to get us an heir.
Now, explain how you, as a councillor of England, can obstruct these measures...... for the sake of your own private conscience.
I think that when statesmen forsake their own private conscience...... for the sake of their public duties...... they lead their country by a short route to chaos.
And we shall have my prayers to fall back on.
You' d like that, wouldn' t you?
To govern the country with prayers?
Yes, I should.
I' d like to be there when you try.
Who will wear this after me?
Who' s our next chancellor?
You?
Fisher?
Suffolk?
- Fisher for me.
- Aye, but for the King?
What about my secretary, Master Cromwell?
Cromwell.
He' s a very able man.
But?
Me rather than Cromwell.
Then, come down to earth.
Until you do...... you and I are enemies.
As Your Grace wishes.
As God wills.
Perhaps, Your Grace.
You should have been a cleric!
Like yourself, Your Grace?
Goodnight, Sir Thomas.
Sir Thomas.
- What' s this?
- From some grateful poor folk, in Leicester.
- Leicester?
- You do more good than you know, sir.
My daughter has a case, sir, in the Court of Poor Man' s Causes.
Baked apples, sir.
To sweeten my judgement.
I' il give your daughter the same judgement I would give my own.
A fair one, quickly.
Bless you, sir.
I understand.
Yes.
Thank you.
Good evening, Sir Thomas.
- I' il read it.
- It' s an awkward case.
- I could illuminate it for you -- - I' il read it.
Just a moment or two....
Boat!
Chelsea, sir?
Chelsea.
I expect you' il make it worth my while, sir.
- You' ve got a licence?
- Bless you, yes sir, I' ve got a licence.
- Well then, the fares are fixed.
- They are, sir.
Hampton to Chelsea downstream, a penny halfpenny.
Chelsea to Hampton upstream, a penny halfpenny.
Whoever makes the regulations doesn' t row a boat.
Threepence if you get me home for breakfast.
Thank you, sir.
A nice cup, sir.
That' s worth money, sir.
Mind a way, sir.
Thank you, sir.
- Have you been here all night?
- Yes.
You said there was a post?
I' il offer you a post, with a house, a servant and £50 a year.
What post?
At the new school.
A teacher!
Richard, no one' s going to give you a place at court.
Master Cromwell says he' il do something for me.
Well, if you know Cromwell you don' t need my help.
If only you knew how much, much rather, I had your help than his.
Not to a place at court.
Why not?
Look.
- What is it?
- It' s a bribe!
"I am the gift of Averil Machin."
And Averil Machin has a lawsuit in the Court of Requests.
Italian silver.
Take it.
No joke.
Thank you.
What will you do with it?
Sell it.
- And buy what?
- A decent gown!
But Richard, that' s a little bribe.
At court they offer you all sorts of things, home, manor houses, coats of arms.
A man should go where he won' t be tempted.
Why not be a teacher?
You' d be a fine teacher.
Perhaps a great one.
- You!
Your pupils.
Your friends.
God.
Not a bad public, that.
And a quiet life.
You come from talking with the Cardinal.
Yes, talking with the Cardinal.
The high affairs of state.
The divorce?
Boatman!
- Right, sir.
Thank you.
Be a teacher.
- Lady Alice in bed?
- Yes, sir.
- Lady Margaret?
- No, sir.
The Master Roper' s here, sir.
At this hour?
Who let him in?
He' s a hard man to keep out, sir.
Will wants to marry me, Father.
Well, he can' t marry you.
Sir Thomas, I' m called to the Bar.
Oh, congratulations, Roper.
My family may not be at the palace, but in the city --
There' s nothing wrong with your family, Will.
There' s not much wrong with you.
Except you seem to need a clock.
I can buy a clock, sir.
Roper, the answer is no...... and will be no as long as you' re a heretic.
Now, that' s a word I don' t like, Sir Thomas!
It' s not a likeable word or thing.
The Church is heretical!
Dr. Luther' s proved that to my satisfaction!
Luther is an excommunicate!
From a heretic Church!
It' s a shop!
- Salvation by the shilling!
And divorces!
- Will, no!
- What I know, I' il say!
- You' ve no sense of the place!
He' s no sense of the time.
Now listen well.
Two years ago you were a passionate churchman.
Now you' re a passionate Lutheran.
We must just pray that when your head' s finished turning...... your face is to the front again.
- ls your horse here?
- No, sir, I walked.
Well, take a horse from the stables and get back home.
Go along.
May I come again?
Soon.
Is that final, Father?
As long as he' s a heretic, Meg, that' s absolute.
What did Wolsey want?
Nice boy, young Will.
Terribly strong principles, though.
Clumsy, too.
- You' re very pensive.
- You' re very gay.
Was it the divorce?
To bed.
They' re a cantankerous lot, the Ropers.
Always swimming against the stream.
Old Roper was just the same --
You don' t want to talk about it.
No.
- I' m sorry you were awakened, chick.
- I wasn' t sleeping very deeply.
What did Wolsey want?
- Will Roper?
He wants to marry Meg.
- Why you don' t beat that girl l -- - No.
She' s full of education and it' s a delicate commodity.
Goodnight, Meg.
A lawyer' s son.
Well, she' s a lawyer' s daughter.
Norfolk spoke of you for Chancellor of England before he left.
Well, he' s a dangerous friend then.
Wolsey' s chancellor, God help him.
But Norfolk said, if Wolsey fell, you --
If Wolsey fell, the splash would swamp a few small boats like ours.
There' il be no new chancellors while Wolsey lives.
The Duke of Norfolk, Earl Marshal of England.
Have you any message for His Majesty?
If I had served God...... one half so well as I' ve served my King...... God would not have left me here, to die in this place.
Thank God you' re dying here.
The King would have you die in the Tower.
"I am straightly charged by the King himself...
"... here openly to declare how much all England...
"... is beholden to this man.
"And how worthy he is to have the highest room in the realm.
"And how dearly the King' s grace doth love and trust him...
"... not only for much good council...
"... deliberate council, but for better council yet...
"... that which is privy to the King' s person.
"This same Sir Thomas More...
"... here made before you all to be...
"... Lord Chancellor of the Realm."
Calm yourself, Matthew.
Fetch Lady Alice.
That' s very well.
My lady!
The King!
Now remember, the visit' s a surprise.
But he' il know we' re expecting him --
It' s a very great honour.
One friend calling on another.
What' s he really coming for?
To talk about the divorce.
He wants an answer.
- But he' s had his answer.
- He wants another.
Your Majesty does my house more honour than I fear my household will bear.
No ceremony Thomas, no ceremony!
A passing fancy.
I happened to be on the river.
Mud.
By heaven, what an evening.
Lady Alice, I fear we came upon you unexpectedly.
Well, no, Your Grace.
Well, that is, we are ready to entertain --
This is my daughter Margaret, sire.
She' s not yet had the honour to meet Your Grace.
Why Margaret, they told me you were a scholar.
Answer, Margaret.
Among women, I pass for one, Your Grace.
Can you dance, too?
Not well, Your Grace.
Well, I dance superlatively!
That' s a dancer' s leg, Margaret!
Lady Alice, the river' s given me an appetite.
If Your Grace would share a very simple supper.
It would please me.
Lead them in.
Thomas and I will follow.
My lords and gentlemen!
Margaret?
Your Grace?
Do you like music?
Yes, Your Grace.
They' il play to you.
Now, listen to this.
Sit down.
Be seated.
No courtship, Thomas.
You' re my friend, are you not?
Thank God I have a friend for my chancellor.
Readier to befriend, I trust, than he was to be chancellor.
My own knowledge of my poor abilities --
I will judge of your abilities.
You know that Wolsey named you for chancellor?
Before he died, Wolsey named you, and Wolsey was no fool.
He was a statesman of incomparable ability, Your Grace.
Was he?
Was he so?
Then, why did he fail me?
It was villainy then.
Secret opposition, secret.
But deliberate, wilful, meditated opposition.
Wanted to be pope to master me, Wolsey.
Thought!
Because I' m simple and plain and deal with every man straightforwardly.
Because of that I say, do they take me for a simpleton?
Wolsey was a proud man, Thomas.
Pride right through.
And he failed me.
Failed me in the one thing that matters, then as now.
But look.
Be seated.
What an evening.
A man could fight a lion.
Some men could, Your Grace.
Thomas...... touching this matter of my divorce.
Have you thought of it since we last spoke?
Of little else.
Then you see your way clear to me?
That you should put away Queen Catherine, sire?
Alas, as I think of it, I see so clearly...... that I cannot come with Your Grace, that my endeavour is...... not to think of it at all.
Then you haven' t thought enough!
Lilac.
We have them at Hampton.
Not so fine as this, though.
I' m in an excellent frame of mind.
Thomas, you must consider, I stand in peril of my soul.
It was no marriage.
I have lived in incest with my brother' s widow.
Leviticus:
"Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother' s wife."
Leviticus.
Chapter 18, verse 16.
Yes, Your Grace.
But Deuteronomy --
Deuteronomy is ambiguous!
Your Grace, I' m not fitted to meddle in these matters.
To me, it seems a matter for the Holy See --
Thomas, does a man need a pope to tell him where he' s sinned?
It was a sin.
God' s punished me.
I' ve no son.
Son after son she' s borne me.
All dead at birth, or dead within the month.
I never saw the hand of God so clear in anything.
It' s my bounden duty to put away the Queen.
And all the popes, back to Peter, shall not come between me and my duty!
How is it that you cannot see?
Everyone else does.
Then, why does Your Grace need my poor support?
Because you' re honest.
And what is more to the purpose, you' re known to be honest.
Those like Norfolk follow me because I wear the crown.
Those like Cromwell follow because they' re jackals with sharp teeth...... and I' m their tiger.
A mass follows me...... because it follows anything that moves.
And then there' s you.
I am sick to think how much I must displease Your Grace.
No, Thomas, I respect your sincerity.
But respect...... man, that' s water in the desert.
How' d you like our music?
That air they played, it had a certain....
Well, tell me what you thought of it.
Could it have been Your Grace' s own?
Discovered!
Now I' il never know your true opinion, and that' s irksome.
Well, we artists, we love praise, yet we love truth better.
- Well?
To me it seemed delightful.
Thomas, I chose the right man for chancellor.
I should in fairness add that my taste in music is reputedly deplorable.
Your taste in music is excellent!
It exactly coincides with my own.
Music.
Music.
Send them back without me, Thomas.
I' il live here in Chelsea and make music.
My house is at Your Grace' s disposal.
Touching this other business, mark you...... I' il have no opposition.
Your Grace.
No opposition.
Be seated.
I' il leave you out of it but you are my chancellor.
I don' t take it kindly and I' il have no opposition!
I see how it will be.
The bishops will oppose me!
The full- fed princes of the Church!
All hypocrites!
Mind they do not take you in, Thomas!
Your Grace is unjust.
If I cannot serve Your Grace in this great matter of the Queen.
I have no queen!
Catherine' s not my wife!
No priest can make her so.
They that say she is my wife are not only liars, but traitors!
Yes, traitors!
That I will not brook now!
Treachery!
I will not brook.
It maddens me!
It is a deadly canker in the body politic, and I will have it out!
See?
You see how you' ve maddened me?
I hardly know myself.
If you could come with me, there' s no man I' d sooner raise...... yes, with my own hand.
Your Grace overwhelms me.
What' s that?
Eight o' clock, Your Grace.
Lift yourself up, man.
Have I not promised I' il leave you out of it?
Shall we eat?
If Your Grace pleases.
Eight o' clock, you said.
The tide will be turning.
- I was forgetting the tide.
- I' m sorry, Your Grace.
If I don' t catch the tide I' il not get back to Richmond.
No, don' t come.
Lady Alice, I must go and catch the tide.
Affairs call me to court.
So we give you our thanks and we say goodnight!
What' s this?
- You crossed him!
- Somewhat.
- Why?
- I couldn' t find the other way.
You' re too nice altogether, Thomas.
- Woman, mind your house!
- I am minding my house!
God save Your Majesty!
God save the King!
Lift!
Drop blades!
Are you coming my way, Rich?
No.
I think you should, you know.
I can' t tell you anything.
Well?
Stay friends with him.
Whatever may be done by smiling, you may rely on me to do.
Set your mind at rest.
This is not the stuff of which martyrs are made.
Good evening, sir, Lady Alice.
Will wants to talk to you, Father.
I told him it wouldn' t be convenient.
You were quite right.
You' re very free with my daughter' s hand, Roper.
It' s of that I wish to speak.
Sir, you' ve had a disagreement with His Majesty.
- Have l?
- So Meg tells me.
I offer my congratulations.
If it' s true, is it a matter for congratulation?
Yes!
Sir, when last I asked you for your daughter' s hand...... you objected to my unorthodox opinions.
- Yes.
Well, since then my views have somewhat modified.
Well, that' s good hearing, Will.
Mind you, I modify nothing concerning the various corruptions in the Church.
- Quite right.
I see behind that an attack on God.
- Roper!
- The Devil' s work...... to be done by the Devil' s ministers!
For heaven' s sake, remember my office.
If you stand on your office --
No, I don' t stand on it, but there are certain things I may not hear.
Sir Thomas.
Richard?
I fell.
Lady Alice.
- Good evening.
Do you know William Roper, the younger?
By reputation, of course.
- Good evening, Master....
- Rich.
You' ve heard of me?
Yes.
In what connection?
I don' t know what you can have heard.
I sense that I' m not welcome here.
Why Richard?
Have you done something to make you not welcome?
Cromwell is asking questions.
About you.
He' s always asking questions about you and your opinions.
Of whom?
That' s one of his sources.
Of course.
That' s one of my servants.
All right, Matthew.
Well, you look at me as though I were an enemy.
Why Richard, you' re shaking.
Help me.
How?
Employ me.
No.
- No.
I would be faithful.
You couldn' t answer for yourself even so far as tonight.
Arrest him!
- For what?
- He' s dangerous!
He' s a spy!
- That man' s bad!
- There' s no law against that.
- God' s law!
- Then God can arrest him.
- While you talk, he' s gone!
Go he should, if he were the Devil, until he broke the law.
- Now you give the Devil benefit of law!
- Yes, what would you do?
Cut a road through the law to get after the Devil?
I' d cut down every law in England to do that.
And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned on you...... where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat?
This country is planted with laws from coast to coast...... Man' s laws, not God' s, and if you cut them down...... and you' re just the man to do it...... do you really think you could stand upright in the wind that would blow then?
I give the Devil benefit of law for my own safety' s sake.
- Yes.
In there, sir.
Rich?
Come in.
Taken you long enough to get here.
Have I kept you waiting?
Months.
- Here.
- Thank you.
Do you know the news?
- What news?
- Sir Thomas Paget is retiring.
And I succeed him.
Secretary to the Council?
You?
'Tis surprising, isn' t it?
I mean, one sees that' s logical.
Sit down, Rich.
No ceremony, no courtship...... as His Majesty would say.
You see how I trust you.
I' d never repeat or report a thing like that.
What kind of thing would you repeat or report?
Nothing said in friendship.
Do you believe that?
- Why, yes.
- No, seriously.
Well, yes.
Rich, seriously.
That would depend what I was offered.
Don' t say it just to please me.
It' s true.
It would depend what I was offered.
Well, there is another post vacant.
Collector of Revenues for York.
Is it in your gift?
Effectively.
What must I do for it?
I know a man who wants to change his woman.
Normally a matter of small importance, but in this case...... it' s our liege, Lord Henry, the eighth of that name.
Which is a quaint way of saying that if he wants to change his woman, he will.
And our job as administrators...... is to minimise the inconvenience which this is going to cause.
That' s our only job, Rich, to minimise the inconvenience of things.
A harmless occupation you would say, but no.
We administrators are not liked, Rich.
We are not popular.
I say "we" on the assumption you' il accept the post at York I' ve offered you.
Yes.
It' s a bad sign when people are depressed by their own good fortune.
- I' m not depressed.
- You look depressed.
I' ve lost my innocence.
Some time ago.
Have you only just noticed?
Your friend, our present Lord Chancellor, now there' s an innocent man.
The odd thing is, he is.
Yes, I say he is.
Unhappily...... his innocence is tangled up in this problem...... that you can' t change your woman without a divorce...... and you can' t get a divorce unless the Pope says so.
And from this meaningless circumstance, I foresee a certain measure of....
- lnconvenience?
- Just so.
This goblet he gave you, how much was it worth?
Come along, he gave you a silver goblet.
How much did you get for it?
Fifty shillings.
It was a gift, wasn' t it, from a litigant, a woman?
- Yes.
Chancery?
Don' t get drunk!
Which court was the litigant' s case?
Court of Requests.
There.
That wasn' t too painful, was it?
And you' il find it easier, next time.
My Lord Archbishop, my lords...... Reverend Doctors of the Church.
The answer of our liege, Lord Henry...... to his trusty well- beloved subjects...... pontiffs in the Canterbury Convocation.
"His Majesty...
"... acknowledges your humble admission of many grievous errors..."... for which he accepts...
"... the manumission of £100, 000 in token.
"Mindful for the well- being of the realm and the quietness of his subjects...
"... His Majesty requires that you do now straightly renounce your pretended...
"... allegiance to the See of Rome.
"And admit the statute passed through parliament...
"... acknowledging the King' s good title...
"... Supreme Head of the Church in England."
Well, my lords, what' s your answer?
Yea or nay?
His Majesty accepts your resignation very sadly.
He' s mindful of your goodness and past loyalty.
And in any matter concerning your honour and welfare he' il continue your good lord.
You will convey my humble gratitude.
- Help me with this.
- Not l.
- Alice?
- No.
Sun and moon, Master More, you' re taken for a wise man.
Is this wisdom?
To betray your ability...... abandon your station and forget your duty to your kith and kin?
Shall I, sir?
No, thank you, son Roper.
Margaret...... will you?
Yes.
If you want.
There' s my clever girl.
Well done, sir!
In my opinion, that thing' s a degradation.
I' il tell you my opinion of the King' s title, too --
Don' t!
Will, silence!
Remember, you have a wife now...... and may have children.
All right, Thomas, make me understand...... because I tell you, to me this looks like cowardice!
All right, I will.
This isn' t reformation, this is war against the Church.
Our King has declared war on the Pope because the Pope will not declare...
-... that our Queen is not his wife.
- And is she?
Is she?
Have I your word that what we say here is between us two?
Very well.
And if the King should command you to repeat what I may say?
I should keep my word to you.
Then what has become of your oath of obedience to the King?
You lay traps for me!
No, I show you the times.
We are at war with the Pope.
For the Pope' s a prince, isn' t he?
He' s also the descendant of St. Peter, our only link with Christ.
So you believe.
And will you forfeit all you have...... which includes the respect of your country, for a belief?
Because what matters is that I believe it, or rather, no...... not that I believe it, but that I believe it.
- I trust I make myself obscure?
- Perfectly.
Why do you insult me with this lawyer' s chatter?
Because I' m afraid.
Man, you' re ill.
This isn' t Spain, you know.
This is England.
My friends, you all know why I' ve called you here.
I have today resigned my office.
I am no longer a great man.
Sir, we want you to know that we' re all on your side.
My side?
What side is that?
Well, sir, we all know what you think.
None of you knows what I think.
And if you guess...... and babble it about, you do me no good service.
Since I am no more a great man, I no longer need a great household.
Nor can I afford one.
You will have to go.
However, I still number some great men among my friends...... and they still need great households.
No one will be turned away until we' ve found another place for him.
- We can' t find places for them all.
- Yes, we can.
Thank you.
That is all.
What about you, Matthew?
Will you stay?
Well, sir, that' s according.
There will be more work and less money.
Well then, I don' t see how I can then, sir.
After all, I' ve got my own --
Quite right, Matthew.
I shall miss you, Matthew.
Oh, no, sir, you see through me, sir.
I know that.
I shall miss you.
Damn me!
Isn' t that them all over!
What' s in me for him to miss?
"Matthew, will you take a cut in wages?"
No, Sir Thomas, I will not.
And that' s it.
All right, so he' s down on his luck, I' m sorry.
I don' t mind saying that I' m sorry, bad luck.
If I had good luck to spare he could have some!
I wish we could have good luck all the time.
I wish rainwater was beer!
I wish we had wings!
But we don' t.
Well, there' s an end of you.
What' il you do now?
Sit by the fire...... and make goslings in the ash?
Not at all, Alice.
I expect I' il write a bit...... I' il write...... I' il read, I' il think.
I think I' il learn to fish.
I' il play with my grandchildren when son Roper' s done his duty.
- Alice, shall I teach you to read?
- No, by God!
Poor, silly man, you think they' il leave you here to think?
If we govern our tongues, they will!
I' ve made no statement.
I' ve resigned, that' s all.
The King is made, by act of parliament, Supreme Head of the Church in England.
This English Church will divorce him from the Queen, then marry him to Lady Anne.
But on any of these matters, have you heard me make a statement?
No.
If I' m to lose my rank and fall to housekeeping, I want to know the reason.
- So make a statement now.
- No.
Alice, it' s a point of law.
Accept it from me...... that in silence is my safety, under the law.
And my silence must be absolute, it must extend to you.
In short, you don' t trust me.
I' m the Lord Chief Justice, I' m Cromwell, I' m the keeper of the Tower.
I take your hand...... I clamp it on the Bible, on the blessed Cross and I say:
"Woman, has your husband made a statement on these matters?
"On peril of your soul remember, what is your answer?"
No.
And so it must remain.
Have you opened your mind to Meg?
Would I tell Meg what I won' t tell you?
Meg has your heart.
I know that well enough.
This is a dangerous matter then...... if you' ve not told Meg.
No.
When they find I' m silent...... they' il want nothing better than to leave me silent.
You' il see.
But he' s silent, Master Secretary, why not leave him silent?
Your Grace, not being a man of letters...... you perhaps don' t realise the extent of his reputation.
This silence of his is bellowing up and down Europe!
In Europe he is claimed as the King' s enemy.
Crank he may be, traitor he is not.
With a little pressure he can be got to say so.
A brief declaration of his loyalty...
-... to the present administration.
- I still say, let sleeping dogs lie.
The King does not agree with you.
What kind of pressure do you think you can bring to bear?
I have evidence that Sir Thomas, while he was a judge, accepted bribes.
What?
He was the only judge since Cato who didn' t accept bribes!
When was there a chancellor whose possessions, after three years...... totalled £100 and a gold chain?
It is, as you imply, common practice...... but a practice may be common and remain an offence.
This offence could send a man to the Tower.
Come here.
This woman' s name is Averil Machin.
She comes from Leicester.
- She entered a case -- - A property case it was.
Shut your mouth.
A property case in the Court of Requests in April, 1528.
And got a wicked false judgement!
And got an impeccably correct judgement from Sir Thomas.
- No, sir, it was not!
- Tell the gentleman...... about the gift you gave the judge.
I gave him a cup, sir.
A silver ltalian cup I bought in Leicester, for 100 shillings.
Did Sir Thomas accept this cup?
Yes, sir, he did.
He did accept it.
We can corroborate that.
You can go.
- To my way of thinking -- - Go!
- ls that your witness?
- No.
By an odd coincidence that cup later came into the hands of Master Rich here.
How?
- He gave it to me, Your Grace.
Why?
A gift.
Yes, you were a friend, weren' t you?
When did Thomas give you this thing?
I can' t exactly remember.
Do you "remember" what you did with it?
- I sold it.
- Where?
- A shop.
- Has the shop still got it?
They' ve lost all track of it.
How convenient.
You doubt Master Rich' s word, Your Grace?
It had occurred to me.
This is the bill of sale.
That cow put her case into court in April, you said.
This is dated May.
In other words, the moment Thomas knew the cup was a bribe...... he dropped it into the nearest gutter.
The facts will bear that interpretation, I suppose.
This is a horse that won' t run, Master Secretary.
Just a trial gallop.
We' il find something better.
- I want no part of it.
- You have no choice.
What' s that you say?
The King particularly wishes you to be active in this matter of Sir Thomas.
He' s not told me that.
Indeed?
He told me.
Look here, Cromwell...... what' s the purpose of all this?
There you have me.
It' s a matter of conscience, I think.
The King wants Sir Thomas to bless his marriage.
If Sir Thomas appeared at the wedding now, it might save us all a lot of trouble.
He won' t attend the wedding.
If I were you, I' d try and persuade him.
I really would try, if I were you.
Cromwell, are you threatening me?
My dear Norfolk, this isn' t Spain.
This is England!
Thomas!
Lady Margaret?
We' ve been cutting greens.
We use them for fuel.
I have a letter for your father, Lady Margaret.
From Hampton Court.
He' s to answer certain charges before Secretary Cromwell.
Good of you to come, Sir Thomas.
Master Rich will make a record of our conversation.
Good of you to tell me, Master Secretary.
I think you know one another.
Indeed yes, we' re old friends.
That' s a nice gown you have, Richard.
Sir Thomas, believe me.
But let me tell you all the same.
You have no more sincere admirer than myself.
No, not yet, Rich, not yet.
If I might hear the charges.
- The charges?
- I understand there are certain charges.
Some ambiguities of behaviour I should like to clarify, hardly charges.
Make a note of that, will you, Master Rich?
There are no charges.
The King is not pleased with you.
I am grieved.
And yet, do you know that even now, if you could bring yourself...... to agree with the Church, universities, the Lords and the Commons...... there is no honour which His Majesty would be likely to deny you?
I am well acquainted with His Grace' s generosity.
Very well.
You have heard of the so- called "Holy Maid of Kent"...... who was executed for prophesying against the King?
- Yes, you met her.
How was that?
She spoke no treason.
Our talk was not political.
But the woman was notorious.
Do you expect me to believe that?
- Happily, there were witnesses.
- You wrote a letter to her.
Yes.
I wrote, advising her to abstain from meddling in the affairs of state.
I have a copy of the letter.
Also witnessed.
- You have been cautious.
- I like to keep my affairs regular.
In the June of 1521, the King published a book.
A theological work.
It was called, A Defence of the Seven Sacraments.
For which he was named "Defender of the Faith" by His Holiness, the Pope.
By the Bishop of Rome, or do you insist on "pope"?
"Bishop of Rome" if you like.
It doesn' t alter his authority.
Thank you.
You come to the point very readily.
What is that authority?
For example, in the Church of England...... what exactly is the Bishop of Rome' s authority?
You will find it very ably set out and defended, Master Secretary...... in the King' s book.
In the book published under the King' s name, would be more accurate.
- You wrote this book.
- I wrote no part of it.
I don' t mean you actually held the pen.
I answered to my best ability, some points of common law...... which the King put to me, as I was bound to do.
Do you deny you instigated it?
It was from first to last the King' s own project.
The King says not.
The King knows the truth of it.
And whatever he may have said to you...... he will not give evidence to support this accusation.
Why not?
Because evidence is given on oath, and he will not perjure himself.
If you don' t know that, then you don' t yet know him.
Have you anything to say...... regarding the King' s marriage with Queen Anne?
I understood I was not to be asked that again.
Then you understood wrongly.
They are terrors for children, Master Secretary, not for me!
Then know that the King commands me to charge you...... in his name, with great ingratitude!
And to tell you that there never was, nor could be, so villainous a servant...... nor so traitorous a subject, as yourself!
So...... I am brought here at last.
Brought?
You' ve brought yourself to where you stand now.
You may go.
For the present.
What will you do now?
Whatever' s necessary.
Boat!
Oh, come, come, it' s not as bad as all that!
Howard!
I can' t get home.
They won' t bring me a boat.
Do you blame them?
Is it as bad as that?
It' s every bit as bad as that!
Then it' s good of you to be seen with me.
I followed you.
Were you followed?
- You' re dangerous to know!
- Then don' t know me.
- I do know you.
- I mean as a friend.
I wish I wasn' t, but I am.
- What' s to be done then?
- Give in.
- I can' t give in, Howard.
Our friendship' s more mutable than that.
The one fixed point in the world of turning friendship...
-... is that Sir More won' t give in.
- To me it has to be, for that' s myself.
Affection goes as deep in me as you, I think.
But only God is love right through, Howard, and that' s my self.
And who are you?
A lawyer!
And a lawyer' s son!
We' re supposed to be the proud ones, the arrogant ones, we' ve all given in.
Why must you stand out?
Goddammit man!
It' s disproportionate!
You' il break my heart.
No one is safe, Howard, and you have a son.
We' il end our friendship now.
- For friendship' s sake?
Daft!
Norfolk, you' re a fool!
You can' t place a quarrel, you haven' t the style.
Hear me out.
You and your class have given in, as you rightly call it...... 'cause this country' s religion means nothing to you at all.
Well, that' s a foolish saying for a start!
The nobility of England --
The nobility of England would have snored through the Sermon on the Mount!
But you' il labour like scholars over a bulldog' s pedigree.
An artificial quarrel is not a quarrel.
We' ve had a quarrel since the day we met.
Our friendship was mere sloth.
You can be cruel when you want, but I' ve always known that.
What do you value in your bulldogs?
Gripping, is it not?
- It' s their nature?
- It' s why you breed them?
It' s so with men.
I will not give in, because I oppose it.
Not my pride, not my spleen, nor any other of my appetites, but I do, l.
Is there, in the midst of all this muscle, no sinew that serves no appetite...... of Norfolk' s, but is just Norfolk?
- Give that some exercise, my lord!
- Thomas!
As you stand you' il go before your Maker ill conditioned!
And he' il think that, somewhere back along your pedigree, a bitch got over the wall!
Cast in this very house on April 3, last year...... it is a matter very fit for the Commons, gathered here...... in parliament, to take in hand.
Or, in consequence of the decay of guilds...... the woolen cloth, now coming out of Yorkshire, Lincoln...... and the like, is not to blame and this....
I will defer the rest of my matter to later.
That the loyal Commons, here assembled, will speedily enact this bill, I doubt not.
For as much as it concerns the King' s new title and his marriage to Queen Anne.
Both matters pleasing to a loyal subject.
Mark, my Masters...... there is among us a brood of discreet traitors...... to which deceit the King can brook no longer.
And we, his loyal huntsmen, must now drive these subtle foxes from their covert.
Father?
I couldn' t get a boat.
What is it, Meg?
Father, there' s a new act going through parliament.
And by this act, they' re going to administer an oath...... about the marriage.
On what compulsion is the oath?
- High treason.
- But what is the wording?
Do the words matter?
We know what it means.
Tell me the words.
An oath is made of words.
It may be possible to take it.
Take it?
And if it can be taken, you must take it, too.
No!
Listen, Meg.
God made the angels to show him splendour.
As he made animals for innocence and plants for their simplicity.
But Man he made to serve him wittily, in the tangle of his mind.
If he suffers us to come to such a case that there is no escaping...... then we may stand to our tackle as best we can.
And yes, Meg, then we can clamour like champions, if we have the spittle for it.
But it' s God' s part, not our own, to bring ourselves to such a pass.
Our natural business lies in escaping.
If I can take this oath, I will.
I would, for my sake, you could take the oath.
I never took a man into the Tower less willingly.
Thank you, Master Governor.
Thank you.
Sir Thomas.
This is iniquitous.
- Where to this time?
- Richmond Palace.
Sit down.
This is the Seventh Commission to inquire into the case...... of Sir Thomas More, appointed by His Majesty' s Council.
Have you anything to say?
No.
- Seen this document before?
- Many times.
It is the Act of Succession.
These are the names of those who have sworn to it.
- I have, as you say, seen it before.
- Will you swear to it?
No.
Thomas, we must know --
We must know plainly whether you recognise the offspring of Queen Anne...... as heirs to the throne.
The King in parliament tells me that they are.
- Of course I recognise them.
- Will you swear to it?
- Yes.
- Then why won' t he swear to the act?
Because there is more than that in the act.
Just so.
Sir Thomas, it states in the preamble that the King' s former marriage...... to the Lady Catherine was unlawful...... she being his brother' s widow and the Pope having no authority to sanction it.
Is that what you deny?
Is that what you dispute?
Is that what you are not sure of?
You insult His Majesty and Council in the person of the Lord Archbishop!
I insult no one.
I will not take the oath.
I will not tell you why I will not.
- Then your reasons must be treasonable!
- Not "must be," may be.
It' s a fair assumption!
The law requires more than an assumption, the law requires a fact.
Of course, I cannot judge your legal standing in the case...... but until I know the ground of your objections...... I can only guess your spiritual standing, too.
If you' re willing to guess that, it should be small matter to guess my objections.
Then you do have objections to the act?
Well, we know that, Cromwell!
No, my lord, you don' t.
You may suppose I have objections, all you know is that I will not swear to it...... for which you cannot lawfully harm me further.
But if you were right in supposing me to have objections, and right again...... in supposing my objections to be treasonable...... the law would let you cut my head off.
Oh, yes.
Well done, Sir Thomas.
I' ve been trying to make that clear to His Grace for some time.
Oh, confound all this!
I' m not a scholar.
I don' t know if the marriage was lawful or not...... but damn it, Thomas, look at these names.
Why can' t you do as I did, and come with us, for fellowship?
And when we die, and you are sent to heaven for doing your conscience...... and I am sent to hell for not doing mine, will you come with me, for fellowship?
So, those of us whose names are there, are damned, Sir Thomas?
I have no window to look into another man' s conscience.
I condemn no one.
- Then the matter is capable of question?
- Certainly.
But that you owe obedience to the King is not capable of question.
So weigh a doubt against a certainty and sign.
Some men think the earth is round, others think it flat.
It is a matter capable of question.
But if it is flat, will the King' s command make it round?
And if it is round, will the King' s command flatten it?
No, I will not sign.
Then you have more regard for your own doubt than the King' s command?
- For myself I have no doubt.
- No doubt of what?
No doubt that I will not take this oath.
But why I will not, you, Master Secretary, will not trick out of me.
I might get it out of you in other ways.
You threaten like a dockside bully.
How should I threaten?
Like a minister of state, with justice!
Justice is what you' re threatened with.
Then I am not threatened.
Gentlemen, can' t I go to bed?
The prisoner may retire as he requests.
- Unless you -- - I see no purpose in prolonging this.
Then, goodnight, Thomas.
May I have one or two more books?
Why, you have books?
Yes.
I didn' t know, you shouldn' t have.
May I see my family?
No.
Captain!
Master Secretary?
Have you ever heard the prisoner speak of the King' s divorce, supremacy...
-... or the King' s marriage?
- No, not a word.
If he does, you will repeat it to me.
Of course.
Tomorrow morning, remove the prisoner' s books.
Is that necessary?
With regards to this case, the King is becoming impatient.
- Aye, with you.
- With all of us.
The King' s impatience will embrace a duke or two.
Sir Redvers Llewellyn has retired.
The Attorney General for Wales.
His post is vacant.
You said that I might approach you.
Not now, Rich.
He must!
Rack him.
No.
The King' s conscience will not permit it.
We have to find some other way.
Father!
Margaret?
Father!
For God' s sake, they haven' t put you in here?
- No, sir, a visit.
- A brief one, Sir Thomas.
- Good morning, husband.
- Good morning.
Good morning, Will.
Well, this is a hellish place!
Except it' s keeping me from you, my dears, it isn' t so bad.
It' s remarkably like any other place.
- It drips!
It' s too near the river.
Well, what is it?
Father, come out!
Swear to the act and come out!
Is this why they' ve let you come?
Meg' s under oath to persuade you.
That was silly, Meg.
How do you plan to do that?
"God more regards the thoughts of the heart than the words of the mouth."
- Well, so you' ve always told me.
Then say the words of the oath and in your heart think otherwise.
What is an oath then, but words we say to God?
Listen, Meg.
When a man takes an oath, he' s holding his own self in his own hands...... Iike water.
And if he opens his fingers then, he needn' t hope to find himself again.
Some men aren' t capable of this, but I' d be loathed to think your father one of them.
- Oh, Meg.
In any state that was half good, you would be raised up high, not here...
-... for what you' ve done already.
- All right.
It' s not your fault the state' s three- quarters bad.
No.
If you elect to suffer for it, you elect to be a hero.
That' s very neat.
But look now.
If we lived in a state where virtue was profitable...... common sense would make us saintly.
But since we see that avarice, anger, pride and stupidity...... commonly profit far beyond charity, modesty, justice and thought...... perhaps we must stand fast a little...... even at the risk of being heroes.
But in reason!
Haven' t you done as much as God can reasonably want?
Well, finally it isn' t a matter of reason.
Finally, it' s a matter of love.
You' re content then to be shut up here with mice and rats...
-... when you might be home with us?
If they' d open a crack that wide, I' d be through it like a bird and back to Chelsea.
I haven' t told you what the house is like without you.
Don' t, Meg.
- What we do in the evening without you.
- Meg, have done.
We don' t read because we' ve no candles.
We don' t talk because we wonder what they' re doing to you.
The King is more merciful.
He doesn' t use the rack.
Two minutes to go, sir.
- Two minutes!
- Jailer!
Two minutes.
All of you must leave the country.
- And leave you?
- It makes no difference.
They won' t let me see you again.
You must all go on the same day, but not on the same boat.
- Different boats from different ports.
- After the trial, then.
There' il be no trial, they have no case.
Do this for me, I beseech you.
- Will?
- Yes, sir.
- Margaret?
- Yes.
Alice?
- Alice, I command you!
- Right.
This is splendid.
- I know who packed this.
- I packed it.
You still make a superlative custard, Alice.
Do l?
That' s a nice dress you have on.
Nice colour anyway.
My God, you think little of me!
I know I' m a fool...... but I' m not such a fool as to be lamenting for my dresses...... or to relish complimenting on my custards.
I' m well rebuked.
- Alice -- - No!
I' m sick with fear when I think of the worst they may do to me.
But worse than that will be to go with you not understanding why I go.
I don' t.
If you can tell me that you understand, I might make a good death, if I have to.
- Your death' s no good to me.
- You must tell me that you understand.
I don' t!
I don' t believe this had to happen!
If you say that I don' t see how I' m to face it.
It' s the truth!
- You' re an honest woman.
- Much good may it do me.
I' il tell you what I' m afraid of...... that when you' ve gone, I shall hate you for it.
You mustn' t, Alice.
You mustn' t.
As for understanding, I understand you' re the best man I ever met or ever likely to.
And if you go, God knows why I suppose, though as God' s my witness...... God' s kept deadly quiet about it.
And if any one wants to know my opinion of the King and his Council...... he only has to ask for it!
Why, it' s a lion I married.
A lion.
This is good.
It' s very good.
Sorry, Sir Thomas!
- Oh, for pity' s sake!
- Time' s up, sir.
- But one more minute!
- You don' t know what you' re asking.
- Come along, Miss.
- For heaven' s sake.
Now, don' t do that, sir.
Now, madam, don' t make trouble.
Come along, please, Lady Alice.
Take your muddy paws off me!
Filthy, stinking, gutter- fed, turnkey!
I' il see you suffer for this!
Goodbye.
You must understand my position, sir.
I' m a plain, simple man and I just want to keep out of trouble.
Dear Lord Jesus, my soul Saviour, clear my wits.
Dear Lady, Blessed Mother of God, comfort my wife and daughter...... and forgive me for them.
Sir Thomas More, though you have heinously offended the King' s majesty...... we hope that if you' il even now forethink and repent of obstinate opinion...... you may still taste his gracious pardon.
My lords, I thank you.
As for the matters you may charge me with...... I fear from my present weakness, that neither my wit...... nor my memory will serve...... to make sufficient answer.
I should be glad to sit down.
A chair for the prisoner.
Master Secretary Cromwell, have you the charge?
- I have, my lord.
- Then read the charge.
"That you did wilfully and maliciously deny and deprive...
"... our liege, Lord Henry, of his undoubted certain title...
"... Supreme Head of the Church in England."
But, I have never denied this title.
At Westminster Hall, at Lambeth, and again at Richmond...... you stubbornly refused the oath.
Was this no denial?
No, this was silence.
And for my silence, I am punished with imprisonment.
- Why have I been called again?
- On a charge of high treason, Sir Thomas.
For which the punishment is not imprisonment.
Death...... comes for us all, my lords.
Yes, even for kings he comes.
The death of kings is not in question, Sir Thomas.
Nor mine, I trust, until I' m proven guilty.
Your life lies in your own hands, Thomas, as it always has!
Is that so, my lord?
Then I' il keep a good grip on it.
So, Sir Thomas...... you stand on your silence?
I do.
But, gentlemen of the jury...... there are many kinds of silence.
Consider first the silence of a man when he is dead.
What do we hear?
Silence.
What does it betoken, this silence?
Nothing.
This is silence pure and simple.
But let us take another case.
Suppose I were to take a dagger from my sleeve...... and make to kill the prisoner with it.
And my lordships there, instead of crying out for me to stop, maintain their silence.
That would betoken!
It would betoken a willingness that I should do it.
And under the law, they would be guilty with me.
So silence can, according to the circumstances...... speak.
Let us consider now the circumstances of the prisoner' s silence.
The oath was put to loyal subjects all over the country who all declared...... His Grace' s title to be just and good!
But when it came to the prisoner, he refused!
He calls this "silence."
Yet, is there a man in this court....
Is there a man in this country...... who does not know Sir Thomas More' s opinion of this title?
Yet, how can this be?
Because this silence betokened...... nay, this silence was not silence at all, but most eloquent denial!
Not so.
Not so, Master Secretary.
The maxim of the law is, "Silence gives consent."
If, therefore, you wish to construe what my silence betokened...... you must construe that I consented, not that I denied.
Is that in fact what the world construes from it?
Do you pretend that is what you wish the world to construe from it?
The world must construe according to its wits.
This court must construe according to the law.
My lords, I wish to call Sir Richard Rich!
Richard Rich, come into court.
"I do swear the evidence I' il give before the court shall be the truth...
"... the whole truth, and nothing but the truth."
"So help me God," sir.
"So help me God."
Now Rich, on May 12, you were at the Tower?
- I was.
- For what purpose?
I was sent to carry away the prisoner' s books.
- Did you talk with the prisoner?
Did you talk of the King' s supremacy of the Church?
Yes.
What did you say?
I said to him, "Supposing there were an act of parliament...
"... to say that I, Richard Rich, were to be king.
"Would not you, Master More, take me for king?"
"That I would," he said.
"For then you would be king."
Then he said, "But I will put you a higher case.
"How, if there were an act of parliament, to say that God should not be God?"
- This is true and then you said -- - Silence!
Continue.
But then I said, "I will put you a middle case.
"Parliament has made our King Head of the Church.
"Why will you not accept him?"
Well?
And then he said, "Parliament had not the power to do it."
Repeat the prisoner' s words.
He said:
"Parliament had not the competence."
Or words to that effect.
He denied the title!
He did.
In good faith, Rich, I am sorrier for your perjury than my peril.
- Do you deny this?
- Yes!
You know if I were a man who heeded not the taking of an oath...... I need not be here.
Now, I will take an oath.
If what Master Rich has said is true...... I pray I may never see God in the face.
Which I would not say, were it otherwise, for anything on earth!
- That is not evidence.
- ls it probable....
Is it probable that after so long a silence on this...... the very point so urgently sought of me...... I should open my mind to such a man as that?
Sir Richard, do you wish to modify your testimony?
No, my lord.
Is there anything you wish to take away from it?
No, my lord.
Have you anything to add?
No, my lord.
- Have you, Sir Thomas?
- To what purpose?
I am a dead man.
You have your will of me.
Then the witness may withdraw.
There is one question I would like to ask the witness.
That' s a chain of office you' re wearing.
The Red Dragon.
What' s this?
Sir Richard is appointed Attorney General for Wales.
For Wales.
Why Richard, it profits a man nothing to give his soul for the whole world.
But for Wales.
I' ve done.
The jury will retire and consider the evidence.
Considering the evidence, it shouldn' t be necessary for them to retire.
Is it necessary?
Then is the prisoner guilty or not guilty?
Guilty, my lord!
Sir Thomas More, you have been found guilty of high treason.
- The sentence of the court -- - My lords!
When I was practising the law, the manner was to ask the prisoner...... before pronouncing sentence, if he had anything to say.
Have you anything to say?
Yes.
Since the court has determined to condemn me...... God knoweth how...... I will now discharge my mind...... concerning the indictment and the King' s title.
The indictment is grounded in an act of parliament...... which is directly repugnant...... to the law of God and His Holy Church.
The supreme government of which no temperable person...... may by any law presume to take upon him.
This was granted...... by the mouth...... of our Saviour, Christ Himself...... to St. Peter and the bishops of Rome whilst He lived...... and was personally present...... here on earth.
It is therefore insufficient in law...... to charge any Christian to obey it.
And more than this...... the immunity of the Church is promised both in Magna Carta...... and in the King' s own coronation oath.
Now, we plainly see you are malicious!
Not so.
I am the King' s true subject...... and I pray for him and all the realm.
I do none harm.
I say none harm.
I think none harm.
And if this be not enough to keep a man alive...... then in good faith, I long not to live.
Nevertheless...... it is not for the supremacy that you have sought my blood...... but because I would not bend to the marriage!
You have been found guilty of high treason.
The sentence of the court is that you be taken...... to the Tower of London...... until the day hence to the appointment...... for your execution!
I am commanded by the King to be brief...... and since I am the King' s obedient subject...... brief I will be.
I die His Majesty' s good servant...... but God' s first.
I forgive you, right readily.
Be not afraid of your office.
You send me to God.
You' re very sure of that, Sir Thomas?
He will not refuse one who is so blithe to go to him.
Thomas More' s head was stuck on Traitor' s Gate for a month.
Then his daughter, Margaret, removed it and kept it 'til her death.
Cromwell was beheaded for high treason five years after More.
The Archbishop was burned at the stake.
The Duke of Norfolk should have been executed for high treason...... but the King died of syphilis the night before.
Richard Rich became Chancellor of England...... and died in his bed.

Now we can all go together.
It' il be wonderful living in the country, much better than a smoky old city.
And if we work hard and don' t eat much, we can saVe money and buy a chicken farm.
There' s money to be made in chickens.
Look at that star!
Isn' t it beautiful!
Hynkel with all his power can neVer touch that.
Commander Schultz escaped.
He' s hiding in my cellar.
He' s holding a meeting at midnight and he wants you to be there.
All right, I' il be down.
This crazy midnight supper...
What does this Schultz want of us?
- What?
We Jewish people shouldn' t get mixed up in such a business.
I know it but Schultz has them all hypnotised.
- Sure he is.
I found him putting a coin in one of your puddings.
Don' t worry, I' ve fixed everything.
Wait and see.
Gentlemen, may I claim your indulgence for a moment?
We are here tonight to rid the country of a tyrant.
In order to carry this out one of us must die.
In ancient times the Aryan tribe of the Langobardians made human sacrifice to the god Thor.
At a feast by lottery the victim was chosen.
Tonight, at this feast, one of you will be chosen.
Each man will receive a pudding.
Concealed in one of these is a coin.
Whoever gets it must give up his life but he will join the long line of history' s noble martyrs and will rid his country of a tyrant.
I know that it is the wish of all of us to be chosen this night to die for Tomainia.
Much as I should like to participate in this ordeal, I cannot...
Why?
Don' t you understand?
He' s too well known.
It must be somebody like us.
I can' t see it like that.
It is a question of my honour.
It is very embarrassing.
Commander Schultz, I apologise for my friend.
Let me say, on behalf of myself and the others, that we consider it a great privilege to die for our country.
Very well, then.
Gentlemen, I shall now retire until fate has chosen the liberator.
Hail Hynk...
What am I saying?
Gentlemen, we haVe pledged our honour.
Proceed!
Gentlemen, the coin is here!
What' s the meaning of this?
Somebody made a fool of us.
- What?
I put a coin in every pudding.
Blowing up palaces and wanting to kill people!
We' re in enough trouble!
Hannah' s right.
We' ve all been foolish.
Our place is at home, looking after our own affairs.
The papers say Schultz may be in the ghetto.
Here, read it for yourself.
Hannah, read that.
"Mystery surrounds the disappearance of ex- Commander Schultz.
"At police HQ it was believed he may be hiding in the ghetto.
"is wanted for questioning."
Me?
Only for questioning.
Not too serious.
Meyerberg was only wanted for questioning.
We never saw him again.
- Who is it?
- It' s me, Mr Mann.
Did you hear what they' re saying about Schultz hiding in the ghetto?
I know, I know.
Don' t you think it' s serious if they find him in the house?
Don' t you realise there are spies everywhere!
Spies?
What' s the matter?
He' s wanted for questioning.
Where' s the Commander?
In the next room.
If Commander Schultz is found in this house, we' il all go to a concentration camp and haVe our heads cut off, too!
Am I arguing?
Then get rid of him.
You can' t throw him out.
Of course not.
But I' d like to know how long he' s going to stay here.
Your breakfast is on the table.
Thank you.
I haVe breakfast waiting at home.
Search eVery house.
- What now?
- They' re looking for Schultz.
He' s in one of these houses.
They' re always looking for somebody.
It' s me.
Let me in.
The storm troopers are searching every house.
Tell the Commander.
- Did you tell him?
- Yes.
- What is it?
- The storm troopers.
- What?
- You' d both better get on the roof.
We can' t leave all these things.
All of you, pack my cases.
You pack that.
Clear this shelf.
Pack this and this.
This mustn' t be found.
Open the door.
They' re here!
Get up on the roof.
Nothing left behind!
- My golf clubs!
- The hatbox!
- Take this.
- Come on, let' s hurry!
- Where are you going?
- With him.
You' il see him later.
- I' il meet you tonight.
- All right.
Take this.
Quick!
Open in the name of Hynkel!
Stop!
Look where you are!
I can' t see, wait a moment.
My bag!
Here it is.
Don' t drop the other one.
My golf clubs, not my golf clubs!
Come here.
They' il see you.
Quick, this way!
Woah, steady!
- Now be careful.
- Yes, sir.
Lucky you didn' t break your neck.
You' il pardon me.
I' m sorry.
You guard the back.
Wait a minute!
I' il have to bother you again.
There he is.
How are you?
So- so.
Here' s your friend.
Your silence will be appreciated.
Take him to the wagon.
Where are you going?
Smoking room.
Come on, this way!
Osterlich!
I am pleased to announce that we are at last ready to march on Osterlich.
This was made possible by the genius of Field Marshal Herring, upon whom I shall now pin a token of my regard.
No!
Gentlemen.
To Field Marshal Herring!
To the invasion of Osterlich!
Elephant!
Wait.
Napaloni' s army is on the Osterlich front.
60, 000 men are on the border.
I can' t believe it.
You can' t believe it!
You let him steal a march on us.
I had the ground coVered.
Declare war on Napaloni!
Mobilise every division of the army and air force.
Attack Bacteria at once!
- But...
- Do as I tell you!
- Shut up!
Will you sign this?
What is it?
A declaration of war.
Yes.
I' il sign it.
I' il sign it!
Napaloni...
- It' s Napaloni.
- Wait a minute.
You talk to him.
Be nice, affable, pleasant.
Well, well, how are you?
No, he hasn' t been playing much.
You went round in 92?
His Excellency?
Just now he' s a little hoarse.
No, I mean he can' t talk.
May I take a message?
He says no doubt you' Ve heard about Osterlich.
He wants to discuss it.
His Excellency invites you to Tomainia to discuss the matter.
I' il make the arrangements.
He' s coming.
We' il put on the greatest military show the world has eVer known.
Napaloni will leave the invasion of Osterlich to me.
And this?
- Your declaration of war.
Peace is declared!
2, 975, 000 eager citizens are massed in the station square awaiting Benzino Napaloni,
Entering the station is our Phooey, ready to greet his guest,
This will cement the friendship between our Phooey and the Dictator of Bacteria,
His Excellency is about to greet the Bacterian ambassador,
How do you do?
Garbitsch...
See about the photography.
Tell the press to see that our Phooey is well photographed.
- Not the back of his head!
Napaloni' s train is coming into the station,
From a pink and white carriage
Napaloni and his wife will step out and Adenoid Hynkel will deliver his address of welcome,
What' s all this mix- up- a?
They' Ve gone too far.
At ease!
Why can' t- a we get out here?
No- a carpet.
Me, Napaloni, I never get out without a carpet.
Lay it down here.
- It' s going back.
- What?
Let' s get out while it' s stopping.
Take it away!
Stay here until they' ve made up their minds.
You got- a da carpet.
Here he is.
- My friend!
This is indeed a pleasure.
Welcome to Tomainia.
Pictures!
Sure.
Another, please.
This is a pleasure, my friend Hynkel.
You want another?
There.
Where' s- a my ambassador?
Hello, Spook.
How do you feel?
Hynky, did you meet- a my wife?
That' s her.
Let' s go.
Tomainia... very nice, very nice.
Your clock is- a slow.
This way.
It' s- a very nice people.
The people are very nice.
Thank you.
He' s my husband!
You make a mistake!
You make a big- a mistake!
Napaloni' s army shall not invade Osterlich.
We shall not discuss the Osterlich situation.
This interview is to impress on him the force of your personality.
To make him feel your superiority.
Napaloni is aggressive, domineering.
We must put him in his place.
But how?
By means of psychology.
By making him feel inferior.
This can be done subtly.
I haVe arranged that he' il be looking up at you, you looking down at him.
His position will be inferior.
Then again we shall seat him here beside your bust so that if you relax that will always be glaring at him.
Where is he now?
Resting.
I have arranged that he will enter from the far end of the room.
Another psychological triumph.
He will have the embarrassment of walking the entire floor.
Signor Napaloni is now leaving his room,
He' s coming.
Quick, give me a flower.
At all times be above him, before him.
Entering or leaving you must be first.
Hello, Hynky!
How are you feel?
My brother dictate!
You' re a nice- a little man.
I' m so glad to see you again.
And my friend the Garbitsch!
This is a lovely place.
I feel- a fine.
I just had a nice cold shower.
When you have the plumbing fixed it' il be in good shape.
Won' t you sit down?
Well, Hynky, my dictator friend, you.
I must be a- growing!
A baby stool?
I like it better upstairs.
Garbitsch, this is a lovely country.
Very nice- a people.
I thought the public enthusiastic.
They like to see new faces.
I' m sorry for the mishap that occurred to Madam Napaloni.
What' s that?
I' m sorry for the Napaloni that occurred at the... at...
Madam Napaloni at the station.
She' s not used to public life.
She can' t take it.
Match.
I' m sorry...
Don' t apologise.
I find- a one.
I' m simply crazy about this palace.
IVory and gold.
A lovely combination.
Gets away from that gingerbread idea.
Tell me something, Garbitsch, what' s on the programme?
The grand ball this evening.
And a review of the army.
That won' t take- a long!
I' m afraid it will.
So you got a big army, huh?
Modesty forbids.
Seems I' ve heard about it.
I think I' il get me a shave.
We haVe a barbershop.
Is that so?
What do you say we go together?
- Delighted.
- Good!
Very well, this way.
This is it.
I can- a smell 'em.
This is- a very sweet.
It was the library.
A good barbershop.
- Is that so?
When I get shaVed I like something to look at.
So I' m putting in glass walls.
This way, I shall have a view of the mountains.
And this, a view through the glass ceiling.
- What' s aboVe?
- The ballroom.
In my summer palace I haVe a barbershop.
Is that so?
Also with glass walls.
You don' t tell me!
With goldfish inside.
Goldfish swimming inside the walls?
How do you feed them?
You can' t, they' re all dead.
That' s why I' m building a new one.
- Very interesting!
- You like it?
The Hynkel stadium, Before half a million spectators the greatest ever display of arms marches by in review,
Our beloVed Phooey and I' il- Dig- a- Ditchy are seated, thrilled by this historic event,
Nothing.
I' m just chewing.
Some peanuts?
- I' Ve had some.
- Good shape.
Here you are, Spook.
Now passing, Tomainia' s heavy artillery,
It' s all right.
I want to show you my new bombing planes.
They' re coming over.
- Aroma.
Aroma?
That' s 400 miles away.
I don' t know what' s detaining them.
Now passing, Tomainia' s light artillery,
Very light!
And here come the armoured tanks, the pride of Tomainia' s army,
The latest design, the last word in modern warfare,
Where' s the propellers?
For going under the water!
Under water?
You neVer heard of tanks that go under the water and fly up- a stairs?
- What' s that?
- Under the water and in the air.
Obsolete now!
We' re concentrating on flying dreadnoughts.
- What' s that?
- My planes!
Now passing, Hynkel' s flying division number 34,
Our planes!
They' re yours.
Garbitsch!
The invasion of Osterlich.
Our troops, tanks and guns will be hidden along the border.
To disarm suspicion, you will go hunting.
Then you will show up at Pretzelburg, meet the army, step into a car and cross over into Osterlich.
Herring and I will be waiting at the capital.
First Napaloni must remove his troops.
To be decided tonight.
Where is Napaloni?
I' il look for him.
It might be advisable for you to dance with Madam Napaloni.
It' il carry weight.
You mean I will!
You find him!
And let me know at once.
- Madam Napaloni...
- Your Excellency!
Why so triste?
No?
May I haVe the pleasure?
Allow me.
Excellent.
Very good.
Good.
- Benzino!
I' ve been looking for you.
Let' s go to some quiet place where we can talk- a things over.
- As you wish.
- An excellent idea.
To the buffet!
Of course, this way.
There' s a Tomainian proverb...
I wish I understand it.
Yes.
No problem.
It should be no trouble.
- Wait.
Out!
Out.
- Yes.
It' s just a matter of detail.
Strawberries!
- Have you any English mustard?
- English mustard.
- Very hot.
Good shape.
Cream.
Hynky, I' m going to make this very simple.
I agree not to invade Osterlich.
We sign, then I remove my troops from the border.
When your troops are gone, I sign.
That' s- a right.
Just a minute, you don' t understand.
First we sign, then I remoVe- a da troops.
- Precisely.
- Just a minute.
Hey, Spook, treaty.
Hold- a dis.
Now, look, you sign- a dis treaty first.
Then I remoVe my troops after.
Why are we arguing?
You said I remove first.
I can' t sign while they' re there.
- Why not?
- Why should I?
- Osterlich is a free country!
Your soldiers are there.
And they' il stay until you sign.
I' il blow them off.
This won' t get us anywhere.
To quote an old Latin phrase...
Strawberries!
Where' s- a my sandwich?
Another one!
I don' t get this treatment in my own joint!
Can' t we discuss this without passion?
I' m not- a passionate.
I' m just...
I want him to sign the treaty.
What would my people think, signing such a treaty when your soldiers are on the border?
I won' t move until you sign!
Not until you clear the border will I sign!
Then they remain.
Then I kick them off.
One move from you and my artillery will blow you to pieces!
And my aeroplanes will bomb your artillery like that!
You want- a start a world war?
You and the world I' il throw in the ocean!
Strawberries!
Your Excellency, we haVe...
I got- a my guns here in the pass and I' il blow him to pieces.
What' s the matter?
What ails you?
This isn' t like you.
Hey, Garbitsch, come here.
What' s with Hynky?
Mustard on his strawberries.
What else can you expect from Hynky?
My little bambino!
The Bacterian...
Tomainia...
You cannot treat Bacteria this way.
I' il take the Bacterian people and tear them apart, like this!
Look what he' s doing!
It' s an insult to my people!
He' s- a tearing spaghetti!
He sign- a the treaty or we haVe a war!
Give me a- something!
Quick, give me a- something!
- I have an appointment.
Press.
How' s the conference progressing?
Very successfully.
How did you get in?
How did he get here?
You know the regulations about reporters.
No one is to enter the palace under any circumstances, understand?
There are minor details to be cleaned up...
Excuse me, we' re busy.
The whole world will know we' re fighting!
- So what?
- Can' t we come to an agreement?
I sign nothing.
I must speak to you alone.
Do you mind?
I don' t mind!
Sign!
Sign!
He' il haVe the adVantage.
It' s a mere scrap of paper.
When his troops are off the border, we can move in.
I' il sign.
What?
Hold- a this.
Ah, my little Hynky!
My dictator brother!
I knew we haVe- a no trouble.
Two prisoners escaped in officers' uniforms.
Sound the alarm!
Two prisoners escaped.
The planes are searching for us.
The woods.
The border' s that way.
The invasion of Osterlich.
Now or neVer.
Ducks.
Did you hear that?
It came from oVer there.
A yodeller.
Where did you get that outfit?
- What?
- Don' t answer back!
Where' s Schultz?
You won' t talk, eh?
- He will when we get him to camp.
- Come on.
There it is.
The village of Pretzelburg.
If we can pass through there we' re safe.
Through the woods?
They' re swarming with soldiers.
They' d suspect us at once.
If you see anyone, don' t look right or left.
We must bluff our way through.
Here they come.
Can you see what they' re doing?
- Looking this way.
- Keep going!
They' re following us.
Shall we run?
Certainly not.
Just a little bit?
Keep walking!
We could walk faster.
Make up your mind.
Slow down?
- No!
- There' s no hurry.
He' s here!
Sound assembly!
Attention!
Present arms!
Turn back?
No, keep going!
Hail Hynkel!
Your Excellency, everything is under control.
- Good.
- Good.
I have been in communication with Marshal Herring in Osterlich.
The route is well guarded.
Behind us are 200 tanks, 50 armoured cars and 500 machine- guns.
- Good.
- Good.
Are we ready to start?
- Yes.
- Yes.
Gentlemen.
Schultz, I' m happy you' re with us again.
Thank you.
Where are we going?
You' re invading Osterlich.
They' re coming.
Your Excellency.
The world awaits your words.
What' s happened?
He looks strange.
What' s Schultz doing here?
Pardoned, I suppose.
Secretary of the Interior, Minister of Propaganda...
Victory shall come to the worthy.
Today, democracy, liberty and equality are words to fool the people.
No nation can progress with such ideas.
Therefore, we abolish them.
In the future, each man will serve the state with absolute obedience.
Let him who refuses beware!
Citizenship will be taken away from all Jews and non- Aryans.
They are inferior and therefore enemies of the state.
It is the duty of all true Aryans to hate and despise them.
This nation is annexed to the Tomainian Empire, and the people will obey the laws bestowed on us by our great leader, the Dictator of Tomainia, the conqueror of Osterlich, the future Emperor of the World!
You must speak.
I can' t.
You must.
It' s our only hope.
Hope...
I' m sorry but I don' t want to be an emperor.
That' s not my business.
I don' t want to rule or conquer anyone.
Jew, gentile, black man, white.
We all want to help one another.
Human beings are like that.
We want to live by each other' s happiness, not misery.
We don' t want to hate one another.
In this world, the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone.
The way of life can be free and beautiful but we haVe lost the way.
Greed has poisoned men' s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose- stepped us into bloodshed.
We haVe deVeloped speed but have shut ourselves in.
Machinery has left us in want.
Our knowledge has made us cynical, our cleverness, hard and unkind.
We think too much and feel too little.
More than machinery we need humanity.
More than cleVerness we need kindness and gentleness.
Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost...
The aeroplane and radio haVe brought us closer.
These inventions cry out for the goodness in man, cry out for universal brotherhood, for the unity of us all.
EVen now my voice is reaching millions, millions of despairing men, women and children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.
To those who can hear me I say, do not despair.
The misery upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress.
The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took will return to the people.
So long as men die liberty will never perish.
Soldiers, don' t give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you, enslave you, regiment your lives, tell you what to think and feel, who drill you, treat you like cattle and use you as cannon fodder.
Don' t give yourselves to these men, machine men with machine minds and machine hearts.
You are not machines, you are not cattle, you are men!
You haVe the love of humanity in you.
Don' t hate.
Only the unloVed and the unnatural hate.
Soldiers, don' t fight for slavery, fight for liberty!
St Luke says, "The Kingdom of God is within man."
In you!
You haVe the power to create machines, the power to create happiness.
You haVe the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adVenture.
In the name of democracy, let us use that power.
Let us all unite, let us fight for a new world, a world that will give men a chance to work, that will give youth a future and old age security.
Promising these things, brutes have risen.
But they lie!
They do not fulfil that promise.
They never will!
Dictators free themselves but they enslaVe the people.
Now let us fight to fulfil that promise!
Let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers, to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance.
Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to the happiness of all.
let us unite!
Hannah, can you hear me?
WhereVer you are, look up, Hannah.
The clouds are lifting, the sun is breaking through.
We are coming out of the darkness into a new world, a kindlier world, where men will rise above their hate, their greed and their brutality.
Look up, Hannah.
The soul of man has been given wings.
He is flying into the rainbow, into the light of hope, into the future, the glorious future that belongs to you, to me and to all of us.
Look up, Hannah.
Look up!
Did you hear that?
Listen...
Hey, Curt, you guys gonna have a little bash your last night in town?
Moose has been lookin 'for you all day.
Thought you were tryin 'to avoid him.
What do you got?
- That' s $2, 000, man. $2, 000!
He' s sorry it' s late.
It' s the first scholarship the Moose Lodge has given out.
He says they' re all very proud of you back at the lodge.
- I don' t want it.
It' s yours.
I' il take it.
I' il talk to you later.
She can wait.
- Make it short and sweet, huh?
Listen, I don' t think I' m gonna be going tomorrow.
What are you talking about?
I was thinkin 'I could wait a year, go to City for a while.
You chicken fink.
After all we went through to get accepted?
We' re gettin 'out of this turkey town... and now you wanna crawl back into your cell?
You just can' t stay 17 forever.
- Get that through your head!
- I just need some time.
I gotta go talk to Laurie.
Take it!
We' re leaving in the morning, all right?
We' re leaving in the morning!
We gonna rock and roll ourselves to death, baby!
You got the Wolfman Jack Show!
Don' t with the thing!
Will you stop it with the Big Bopper stuff?
- Not too good, huh?
Why is it every girl around here is ugly or has a boyfriend?
Where is the dazzling beauty I' ve been searching for all my life?
The pickings are really gettin 'slim.
The whole strip is shrinkin '.
You know, I remember about five years ago... it would take a couple of hours and a tank full of gas... just to make one circuit.
It was really somethin '.
Someone new in town.
Are you gonna go after him?
If he can' t find me, then he ain' t even worth racin ', right?
Big shot.
Well?
Where was I?
How you thought high school romances were goofy... and we started dating only because you thought I was cute and funny... but then you suddenly realized... you were in love with me, it was serious...
You were leadin 'up to somethin' kinda big.
You make it sound like I' m giving dictation.
Well, seriously... what I meant was that... since we do care for each other so much... and since we should really consider ourselves as adults now...
Could I have a couple of those fries?
Where was I?
- Right, right.
I thought, maybe before I leave... we could agree that...
seeing other people while I' m away can' t possibly hurt, you know?
- You mean dating other people?
- It would strengthen our relationship.
Then we' d know for sure that we' re really in love.
Not that there' s any doubt.
I think you' re right.
I mean, we' re not kids anymore... and it' s silly to think that when we' re 3, 000 miles apart... we shouldn' t be able to see other people and go out.
I didn' t ask for that back.
I just sort of think it' s juvenile now.
It' s less conspicuous there.
- I didn' t say that.
I understand, and I' m not upset.
I can' t expect you to be a monk while you' re away.
I got a really neat record collection.
I even got "Pledging My Love" by Johnny Ace.
How can you love Nelson when he' s going out with Marilyn Gator?
- Since he dumped on you...
- He didn' t dump on me, you little dip!
Oh, hi, Steve.
Hey, sis.
- What' s wrong?
- Nothing.
- What is it?
- Nothing!
I' ve decided to let you take care of my car while I' m away.
I' m comin 'back for a couple of weeks at Christmas.
I' ve got some very simple instructions for you.
Here' s the keys.
First of all, only 30- weight Castrol- R.
I' ve written the tire pressure and stuff on a pad in the glove...
- Are you listening?
- Hey, what' s wrong?
- Are you crying?
- I can' t believe it!
I don' t know what to say!
I' il love and protect this car until death do us part.
This is a super fine machine.
This might even be better than Darryl Starbird' s superfleck moon...
It' s better than Darryl Starbird' s superfleck moonbird.
Budda?
How' d you like to go to the drive- in movies with me?
- You gotta be kidding.
- Would I kid about a thing like that?
I have a new car.
Did she do that to you?
Curt, you wanna bomb around?
I wanna try out my new wheels.
Well, I' d like to, Toad... but I' m gonna go with Steve and Laurie to the hop.
- Yeah, right.
Tonight, things are gonna be different.
You' re goin 'to the freshman hop?
That place is for kids.
Don' t go back there.
You ain' t got no emotions?
We are going to remember all of the good times.
- Yeah, well, go.
- Why don' t you come with us?
For old times' sake.
Go ahead, Curtsie baby.
You go on over there and remember the good times you won' t be havin '.
I ain' t goin 'off to some goddamn fancy college.
I' m stayin 'right here... havin' fun as usual!
Jesus, Milner, you' re really in a great mood tonight!
What' s the matter, John?
I' m sorry.
Man, it' s nothin '.
- All right.
We' il all do somethin 'together before Steve leaves.
Now you' re not goin '?
I don' t know.
- What happened to your flathead?
- What happened to your flathead?
- Your mother!
Hey, we been talkin '' bout you.
There' s a very wicked '55 Chevy lookin' for you.
- Yeah, I know.
- Watch out for the cop at Jerry' s.
Thanks.
Hey, Toad!
Is that you in that beautiful car?
Jeez, what a waste of machinery!
Hey, kid!
Here we go with another call.
- Answer the phone, dummy.
- Pinkie' s Pizza.
You got any more of those secret agent spy scoops?
Hit parade on a stethoscope?
No, secret agent spy scope, man... that pulls in the moon, stars, the planets... and the satellites and little bitty space men.
You have the wrong number, partner.
Wait!
What did you say?
Hang a right.
Why?
- Steven, cut over to "G" Street.
I saw a goddess.
You gotta catch up to her.
- Come on, Curt.
We can' t be spendin 'half the night chasing girls down for you.
Laurie, this was the most perfect, dazzling creature I' ve ever seen!
Forget it.
- She spoke to me.
I think she said, "I love you."
That means nothing to you people?
You have no romance, no soul?
Someone wants me.
Someone roaming the streets wants me.
Will you turn the corner?
- Alligator.
Where you from?
- Turlock.
- You know a guy named Frank Bartlett?
No.
Does he go to Turlock High?
He goes to J. C. Now.
- Do you go to J. C.?
- Yeah, sure.
Do you know Guy Phillips?
I got him in a class.
He' s so boss!
How' d you like to ride around with me for a while?
I' m going steady.
- Come on!
- I just can' t.
You' re just ridin 'around with a bunch of girls.
Anybody else in there wanna go for a ride?
I' m as harmless as a baby kitten.
I' il go!
- Judy' s sister' il go with you, okay?
Anybody.
We' il go up and stop at that light.
All right?
If you ever get tired of going steady with somebody that ain' t around...
I' m up for grabs.
So, you' re Judy' s little...
How old are you?
I' m old enough.
How old are you?
- You can' t be that old.
I think you better go back and sit with your sister.
Where are they anyway?
This is a joke, right?
This better be a joke, 'cause I' m not drivin' you around!
You asked me.
Am I too ugly?
Judy doesn' t want me with her, and now you don' t want me with you.
Nobody wants me.
Even my mother and father hate me.
- They don' t hate ya.
Stay cool.
We' il find your sister.
- Can' t be too hard to find.
- John, you gonna be there tonight?
Shit!
Hey, get down.
- Is this called "copping a feel"?
No!
Jesus.
- My name?
Mud... if anybody sees you.
- What do you got in there, kid?
- More than you can handle.
I think we' ve had an accident.
Damn it, I won' t report you this time, but next time, just watch it!
- Yeah, hi.
Of course you know it.
You know what I' d like to give you for this car?
I' d like to give you $1, 000!
I can' t give you that, but I' m not gonna give you a whole line.
Come over here.
How would you like, for $525, to own this practically new 'Vette?
I' il tell you what I' m going to do.
How about that?
- No, I' m sorry. $98 a month.
You ask me how can I do this?
I' il tell you how I can do it.
My boss wants to get rid of the sporty cars.
- I' m fine.
I don' t think it' s a good idea.
- I' m busy.
- I want you to listen.
I' ve gotta go!
Leave me alone, for God' s sake!
One, two, three, four
Let' s go!
Why are you so depressed?
You' il forget him in a week.
After you' re elected Senior Queen, you' il have so many boys after your bod.
Peggy, the point is, I do not want to go out with any other guys.
Laurie, I know it' s a drag, but you can' t just...
Remember what happened to Evelyn Chelnick?
When Mike went into the Marines, she had a nervous breakdown... and was acting so wacky she got run over by a bus.
I just wish I could go with him.
Come on.
Hey, everybody...
Just cool it, Steve?
Let me see some of that stuff.
You leavin 'tomorrow?
- You and Laurie engaged yet?
- No, but we got it all worked out.
We' re still gonna be goin 'together, but we can date other people.
I know.
Hey, I hear college girls really put out.
- Come on.
- "Come on" what?
- Let' s dance.
- No, thanks.
- Laurie, I said I wanna dance.
- Who' s stopping you?
I thought you might wanna dance with me our last night together.
How sentimental of you.
You' il be back at Christmas.
- I want to dance now, not at Christmas.
- Get your cooties off me!
- Go ahead.
Scar my face!
I wouldn' t dance with you if you were the last guy in this gym.
- This is getting good.
- Come on, Eddie, I' il dance with you.
You don' t mind, do you, Peggy?
Joe College strikes out.
I' m surrounded.
Come on.
No, really, I' d like to, but I can' t.
If old Mr. Simpson saw me dancing with one of you sexy little... excuse me... one of you young ladies, he' d have my rear end.
Let' s go.
Want a cigarette?
All right.
- I thought you' d left.
I have no matches.
How do I get stuck with dance supervision?
You goin 'back east?
I remember the day I went off.
Got drunk as hell the night before.
- Blotto.
Exactly.
- Barfed on the train all the next day.
Very cute.
Where' d you go again?
Vermont.
- Got a scholarship.
- Only stayed a semester.
One semester, after all that.
Came back here.
Why' d you come back?
Decided I wasn' t the competitive type.
Maybe I was scared.
Well, I think I may find that I' m not... the competitive type myself.
- What do you mean?
- I' m not really sure that I' m going.
Now, don' t be stupid.
Have some fun, Curtis...
Bill?
Mr. Wolfe?
Can I speak with you a minute?
- Jane.
Good luck, Curtis.
Yeah.

The next night we went out with ammunition...
Don' t you have some homework or somethin 'to do?
My mother does it.
Anyway, he thought he was had.
He started the car and couldn' t see through the windshield... and zoomed straight into the canal.
- Watch it, will ya?
Thanks a lot.
Hey, drivin 'is a serious business.
I ain' t havin 'no accidents just because of you.
I' m warning ya.
Spare me, killer.
Oh, shit!
- Why did you do that?
- I don' t like that surfin 'shit.
Rock and roll' s been goin 'downhill ever since Buddy Holly died.
Don' t you think the Beach Boys are boss?
- You would, you grungy little twerp.
- Grungy!
If I had a boyfriend, he' d pound you.

A cop.
I' m gonna tell him you tried to rape me.
I' m gonna tell him how old I am, my parents don' t know I' m out... and you tried to rape me.
- Yeah, with shaving cream.
- Boy, are you up a creek.
Really, Carol, don' t say anything.
"I was a dirty bird.
She' s bitchin '. "
I' il tell him.
She' s bitchin '.
I' il think about it.
- Where you goin ', Milner?
- I' m goin 'home, sir.
- Where' ve you been?
At the movies, sir.
You didn' t happen to be around 12th and "G" about 8: 30 tonight, did you?
No, sir.
We were at the movies, like I said.
I stopped you because the light on your license plate' s out.
I' m gonna have to cite you for that.
Iooks a little low.
It' s 121/ 2 inches, regulation size.
You can check it if you like, sir.
You can' t fool with the law.
We know that was you tonight.
We have an excellent description of this car.
I could run you in right now, and I could make it stick.
But I' m not gonna do that.
You know why?
I want to catch you in the act... and when I do, I' m gonna nail you but good.
Happy birthday, Milner.
Thank you... asshole.
You' re a regular J. D.
File that under C. S. Over there.
What' s that stand for?
That' s what it is.

- You mean John Milner?
Ain' t nobody can beat him, man.
He' s got the fastest...

You see this Milner, you tell him I' m lookin 'for him, huh?
Tell him I aim to blow his ass right off the road.
Ain' t he neat?
What a bitchin 'babe!
Hello.
You sure you don' t need a lift somewhere?
You know John Milner?
John Milner' s a good friend of mine.
Did anybody ever tell you that you look just like Connie Stevens?
I really mean it.
- For real?
I met her once at a Dick Clark road show.
- Yeah?
You really think I look like her?
- Yeah, no shit.
I mean that I' m not just feeding you a line.
You look like Connie Stevens.
- What' s your name?
- Debbie.
I always thought I look like Sandra Dee.

It' s got six Strombergs.
I really love the feel of tuck- and- roll.
You do?
I' il let you feel it.
I mean you can touch it if you want.
I' il let you feel the upholstery.
Okay.
- Peel out.
- What?
I just love it when guys peel out.
And they came all the way from Stockton.
Let' s hear it.
I don' t care if you leave this second.
And we wanna thank Darby Langdon, who did all these neat decorations.
Now the next dance is gonna be a snowball... and leading it off is last year' s class president, Steve Bolander... and this year' s head cheerleader, Laurie Henderson.
- Come on.
- "Come on" what?
Smile or something.
Quit pinching!
You think I' m gonna crack up?
- Boy, are you conceited!
- I don' t know why I ever asked you out.
I asked you out.
- What do you mean, you asked me out?
Backwards Day.
Remember?
Oh, brother!
Even after that, you didn' t call me for two weeks.
- I was busy.
- You were scared.
Dave Ogler told me.
When you did ask me out, you didn' t kiss me for three dates.
- Well, I was...
- Scared.
Jim Kiler told me.
I even asked my father why you hadn' t kissed me.
- Your father.
Great.
- You know what he said?
He said he thought you were bright enough... and that you' d probably get around to it after a while.
You didn' t, of course.
I had to.
Remember the picnic?
Out at the canyon?
You don' t remember anything, do you?
The first one, up at the lake.
That was the first time you kissed me.
I had to practically throw myself at you.
I remember.
What' s wrong?
Go to hell.
What are you doin ', stealin' hubcaps?
- Well, hey, Wendy.
- How' ve you been?
Fine.
How you been?
- Wait a sec.
Wait a minute!
Bobbie Tucker.
She' s got her car.
- Heard you' re going away to school.
- Maybe, maybe.
- What?
- Same old Curt.
All the time we were going together, you never knew what you were doing.
- I gotta go.
- Where ya goin '?
- Nowhere.
- You mind if I come along?
- Okay.
Louie, Louie
Me gotta go
All right, Bolander, break that up.
You know the rules.
You and your girlfriend wanna do that, go someplace else, huh?
Why don' t you go kiss a duck?
- What did you say?
- I said go kiss a duck, marble- head.
All right, Bolander, you are suspended.
Don' t you even come in Monday.
You' re out!
Remember?
Why don' t we go out to the canal?
What for?
Listen, I can get tough with you too, you know.
Hard guy.
A double Chubby Chuck, a chili- barb, two orders of French fries and...
- Cherry Coke.
- And two Cherry Cokes.
What?
Cool.
How' s my soft baby?
Beat it, Vic.
I' m not your baby.
Come on, honey.
I been, you know, busy.
Yeah, three weeks?
Besides, it only took me one night to realize... if brains were dynamite, you couldn' t blow your nose.
Look who' s talking.
Einstein?
Tiger happens to be very intelligent, unlike you.
It shows.
The lady obviously doesn' t want...
You want a knuckle sandwich?
I' m waitin 'for a double Chubby Chuck.
Then keep your smart- ass mouth shut.
I' il call you sometime, Deb.
- Some night when I' m hard up.
- I won' t be home.
Get out of here.
You seem to know a lot of weird guys.
That creep' s not a friend of mine.
He' s just... horny.
That' s why I like you.
You' re different.
I am?
I mean, you really think I' m intelligent?
And I bet you' re smart enough to get us some brew.
Brew?
Oh, liquor.
Yeah, this place is too crowded anyway.
What about your hamburgers and Cokes, sir?
You' re gonna lose her.
Just hang a right at the corner.
Lost her again.
- Who is she?
- I don' t know.
But I' m gonna find out.
I know who she is.
Well, come on, Bob.
Who is she?
Come on!
You know Mr. Beeman?
He owns Hepcat Jewelers?
That' s his wife.
Get outta here.
That' s ridiculous.
That girl is young and beautiful.
- And married.
- And she was cruising Tenth Street.
You gotta be thinkin 'of someone else.
Did you know that my ex is going to become a presidential aide?
It' s a secret, so don' t tell anybody, but his greatest ambition... is to shake hands with President Kennedy.
How do you suppose you' re gonna do that, wishy- washy, at J. C.?
Maybe I' ve grown up.
Maybe I changed my mind.
- Maybe you don' t think you can do it.
- Maybe you oughta shut up.
- Maybe I ought to, but I won' t.
Maybe you oughta come into the aft chamber... where we can discuss this in private.
Thanks a lot.
Come on, Wendy.
I' m not sitting on your lap.
- To the opera, James.
- Drop dead.
Unless you want to go to Gallo Dam and have a little orgy.
You wish!
We could roll around in it for a while.
- I' ve been silly.
- Yeah?
I' m really glad you' re gonna stay.
We might even have a class together.
- Look.
There' s Kip Pullman.
He' s so neat.
Say somethin 'to him when we go by.
- What do you want me to say?
I just wanna meet him.
What' s up?
Hey, Henderson, long time no see.
What you been doin '?
Nothin '.
I just wanted to tell you Bobbie here is madly in love with you... and trembles at the sight of your rippling biceps.
- Out of my car, you...
- Wait a second!
I hate you!
Get out of my car!
Temper, temper!
One ten- cent Coke with ice.
Please.
I thought some of my friends might be here.
Probably a couple of weeks past their bedtime.
There' s Dee Dee.
I hope she sees me.
Dee Dee.
Hiya, John.
- What do you say, Al?
- Not much.
You think if I brought my Mopar by the shop on Monday... you could spot- weld the bumper bracket?
Just come by before noon, all right?
- No, no.
Hi, Linda.
This is my cousin, Carol.
I' m baby- sittin '.
- Jesus!
Watch it, will ya?
Been hittin 'me all night.
Kids will be kids, you know.
Why don' t you grow up, for Christ' s sake?
We don' t get along too well, you know?
- Been like this all...
- You spastic creep.
How' s your bod?
Wolfman Top 40 is Box 1300, Chula Vista.
Wolfman sweatshirts is Wolf Enterprises, Bakersfield.
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes, son?
- Sure.
It' s quarter to 12: 00.
Thanks a lot.
Excuse me, sir.
I got a problem.
See, I lost my I. D. In a flood... and I was wondering, since you' re going in there anyway... could you pick me up some Old Harper' s... hard stuff?
- Would you buy me a bottle?
- Why, certainly.
I lost my wife too.
Her name wasn' t Idy though... and it wasn' t in a flood, but I know what you...
Here' s some money.
Old Harper.
- Right- o.
- Night.
No, not wine!
- Was there an old man in here just now?
Just went out the back.
Want something?
Yeah.
Let me have a Three Musketeers... and a ballpoint pen, one of those combs there... a pint of Old Harper... a couple of flashlight batteries and some beef jerky.
You got an ID for the liquor?
Yeah.
I left it in the car.
You' il have to get it before.
I forgot the car.
Did you get it?
You got it!
Why didn' t you get it?
I needed some things and I thought as long as I was in there...
Look, Debbie, can you loan me a dollar?
Come on.
Guys pay.
See, I' ve only got a 50, and he doesn' t have change.
I really cannot believe this.
Here.
Could you...
- Buy you a bottle of booze?
Yeah, I know.
You lost your I. D. What kind do you want?
Gee, that' s terrific.
Just some Old Harper?
That one over there... that' s Freddy Benson' s' Vette.
Boom!
Didn' t have a chance.
He was a good driver too.
It' s pretty grim when a guy gets it and it' s not even his own fault.
Needs a paint job, that' s for sure.
That '41?
That used to be... believe it or not... the fastest car in the valley.
I never got a chance to race Earl, though.
He got his 1955 in about the hairiest crash we ever had here.
(Boy) "You are standing in the cavern of the evil wizard."
"All around you are the carcasses of slain ice dwarfs."
Melt wizard. "
"What do you wanna melt him with?"
- What do ya think I wanna melt him with?
- I told you to take out the garbage.
- Just a second!
"Throw... thermal..."
- (man) Didn' t you hear what Mom said?
(Mom) Joshua Baskin!
"Your hesitancy has cost you dearly."
"The wizard, sensing your apprehension, unleashes a fatal bolt from the ice sceptre."
"With luck, you will thaw in several million years."
Great (!)
(Mom) Come on!
Josh, it' s starting to stink up the place!
OK, OK, OK!
"Take the garbage out."
"Take the garbage out." There!
Yeah!
Wait.
The Yankees' star pitcher is coming outta the bull pen!
They' re going crazy!
- Is Billy there?
- In the back.
Rick Rowden is on the mound for the Yankees.
He looks into the catcher' s mitt, shakes off the first signal, takes the curve.
He wipes the sweat off his brow, leans back and fires.
(Billy) Yeah!
Goodbye, Mr Spalding!
(Billy) Here, here.
Wait.
Got it.
Need it.
Got it.
Do you ever go by Simpkins' desk when she' s grading papers?
When she leans over, you can see right down her shirt.
- I swear to God.
- Bra?
- No, she' s got one of those undershirt things.
So if you get real close to the board,..... you can see all the way down to her flowers.
Gimme your gum.
- Need it.
Got it.
Need it...
(Josh) Oh, my God.
How did a geek like Freddie Benson get a sister like that?
Beats me.
Hi, Josh.
- Hi.
- Oh, my God.
It' s Billy.
- He says hi.
- Come on, Miss Cheapo.
A quarter!
Unbelievable!
She likes you.
I know she likes you.
I' il find out, OK?
(both chuckle) (Josh) Call me after supper.
I' m as interested as you are.
- So?
Will you tell me?
- You' re in.
- What do ya mean, I' m in?
- Cynthia Benson!
- What about her?
- Are you ready for this?
- She doesn' t like Barry any more.
What do ya mean, "So?"
That' s it - she' s available!
- Billy, it doesn' t mean...
- (Mom) Josh?
It' s after midnight.
- Now say good night to Billy.
- Good night, Billy.
Good night, Mrs Baskin!
- (chuckles) - Sweet dreams!
I' m ready.
One more try.
OK, honey, big smile.
Big smile!
Good.
"Wimpy"!
Oh, better luck next time.
Please?
One more?
I can' t live with "Wimpy"!
Are you sure you wanna go on this, son?
- No, I don' t know about this one, Bob.
- No, this looks too scary.
- (Bob) It' s OK.
- Oh, my God!
- I told you.
He doesn' t wanna go on it.
- You don' t have to go on it if you don' t...
I wanna go on myself.
- You do?
- Yeah.
I think it' s something...
- Yeah, I think it' s something I should do.
Why don' t we meet you at the Ferris wheel?
Half- hour.
- (Josh) Excuse me.
(girl) Sal threw up on the other ride.
- (clears throat) - Josh?
- Oh... hi.
Have you been on this before?
- This?
- Yeah.
- Yes.
- Is it scary?
Yes.
Are you here alone?
Yes.
- Look.
Aren' t those your parents?
- Right over there.
- Smile!
Why... yes.
Who' s this?
- Josh Baskin.
- How' re you doin '?
- This is Derek.
He drives.
- (man) Next.
- Go ahead!
- Yo, next!
Read this sign.
- What?
Hey, I don' t make the rules.
Next!
Next!
Well, it' s a stupid rule.
Look, why don' t you try the kiddie wheel?
See you, Josh.
"Drop 25 cents here."
Come on!
Work!
Work!
Neat!
Make my wish...
Right.
I wish I were big.
"Your wish is granted."
Shh.
Come on, come on.
You sleep with me.
Easy, dog!
Easy!
Don' t make me do it.
I' m only part- time.
- (spraying) - Sorry!
Josh!
- (grunts) What?
- (Mom) It' s 7. 30!
- (yawning)
(Mom) Come on, sleepyhead!
You' re gonna miss the bus, and I can' t drive you today!
What does he do in his sleep?
(Mom) Honey?
I put out some clean clothes.
Bring down your dungarees and stuff for the laundry, OK?
(deep voice) OK.
- Are you getting a cold, Josh?
- (high- pitched) No!
He' s got a cold.
Now Rachel' s gonna get a cold, I' m gonna get a cold...
Oh, my God!
- Breakfast is ready, Josh!
- Be right there!
Josh!
Hurry up!
Your eggs are getting cold.
- Hold this.
Hold this.
Keep it a secret.
Bring down Rachel with you, all right?
OK.
Come on.
Come on.
Quiet, quiet.
- (Rachel giggles)
What about your breakfast?
- Don' t...
Don' t...
I' m sorry.
- No, don' t!
- Mom, it' s me.
It' s Josh.
- I' m a grown- up.
- Stop it!
I made a wish last night.
I turned into a grown- up, Mom.
I made this wish on the machine and it turned me into a grown- up - at the carnival.
My birthday' s November 3rd.
I got a "B" in history.
Here, take the purse.
You can have anything that' s in it.
- (terrified gasps)
Who are you calling?
I have a birthmark behind my left knee.
- You bastard!
What did you do to my son?
- I am your son.
- Where is my child?
Ma!
- Police!
Heads up!
Heads up on defence!
All the way!
(boy # 2) It' s all yours!
I' m open!
Here, I' m open!
(boy # 1) Shoot!
(teacher) Gentlemen, the period is over.
- Get back to the locker room.
- (boy # 2) Billy is a dick!
Wash your shirts and shorts.
Do us both a favour.
Put the balls away, and you practise your lay- up.
Harvitz!
Pick up that shirt or I' il make you eat it.
Let' s go, gentlemen.
Let us go.
- Billy.
- Yeah.
- What?
- It' s me.
It' s Josh.
- Coach Barnes!
- Wait, wait!
- Coach Barnes!
- Shut up!
I' m your best friend.
Please, you gotta believe me.
Billy, please!
- Help!
- Goddamn it, Billy Francis Kopeche!
Look, I know I don' t look like myself, but something really strange happened.
I' m really scared and I need your help.
I can prove it.
Josh?
You look terrible.
I know.
(woman) I was in the house making my gravy and I heard this commotion.
(cop) We' re at the scene right now.
The mother' s pretty hysterical.
It' s not making any sense at all.
There' s no ransom note, no prints - no nothing.
- File a report, to be on the safe side.
Quiet.
- I bet he ran away.
- I wish I could.
You want me to pack your bags?
We go to the city, we lay low for a couple of days.
We find the Zoltar machine, you make a wish.
You' il be home by Thursday.
- I can' t go to New York without my folks.
You' il be fine.
Here.
- Where did you get this?
- From my dad' s top drawer.
- You stole it?
- It' s his emergency fund.
- Jesus, Billy!
- Well, what do ya call this?
Fine!
Fine.
Kill her.
Kill her!
With a knife.
Kill the bitch with a knife.
- Looking for some fun?
- Hey, man.
Can you spare some change?
- No, not really.
This looks OK.
- No, it doesn' t.
- St James, Josh.
It' s religious.
Hi.
Hi.
Um... w- we would like a hotel room, please.
17. 50 a night for the room. $10 deposit for the sheets.
You go straight to the top of the stairs.
It' s the last door on the right.
Next to the bathroom.
Wait a second, I' il show ya.
- (Billy) It smells bad.
- Have a pleasant stay.
- Thanks.
(clerk) Hey, Angel!
Get outta that bathroom now.
- I don' t wanna stay here by myself.
- I can' t help it, Josh.
I gotta be home by ten.
I' il cut classes tomorrow.
We' il find that Zoltar thing before you know it.
OK?
Just one night!
All right?
- All right.
- Good.
- What if I can' t sleep?
- It' s probably better if you don' t.
- See ya in the morning.
- Well... you know, like, what time?
8. 30.
(woman) My mother was right!
You' re a pig!
I' d use the chain if I were you.
Mom!
Mom...
- I told you, it' s not a video game!
- Then what is it?
Well, it' s not a video game.
(Billy) This one has a number on it.
Does yours?
Here' s one.
What are you doing?
- Do you have Zoltar?
- No, I told you.
I' ve got Power House...
- We need Zoltar.
- I haven' t got it.
- (Billy) This is it.
- They' re not gonna have it.
- Can I help you?
-.. of all carnivals and fairs.
- And arcades.
Carnivals and... fairs...
Uh, try Consumer Affairs.
Down the hall - room 111.
Thank you.
Fill this out in triplicate. $5 filing charge.
- See?
- You get it in six weeks.
- Six weeks?
- Sometimes longer, but you could get lucky.
Next, please.
Fill this out.
I' m gonna be thirty years old for the rest of my life.
Would you come on?
We' il figure something out.
(chuckles)
- So now what?
- I' il come and see you every day after school.
- How?
- I' il tell them I made the basketball team.
- What am I gonna do?
- You can get a job.
- Why?
What are you good at?
Making spitballs?
- How 'bout a delivery man?
- I don' t know how to drive.
Yeah, right.
Cardiological technician?
Civil engineer?
- You' re not eating your cherry?
- Go ahead.
- Clerical transcriber?
- Billy.
- Gross.
Gr...
- Check, please.
- Go on.
- Collection agent.
Company clerk.
- Computer operator.
Construction engineer.
- Computer operator?
Read that one.
- Will you quit with your stupid computers?
- Just read it!
- "MacMillan Toys..." Toys!
- (phone rings) - MacMillan Toys.
May I help you?
- Are these the applications?
OK, OK, what' s next?
There.
Previous employment.
- Your paper route.
- I don' t think I can put that.
- Paper route circulation director?
- Yeah!
What' s he got?
Hey, don' t worry about it.
Social Security number?
- 32- 17- 25.
- What is that?
- My locker combination.
Great.
Mr Baskin?
Mr Baskin?
- Y- yes...
- The personnel director will see you now.
Uh... your son can wait out here.
OK.
Son, you should sit down.
And don' t give the lady any trouble, now.
Sure, Dad.
- This way.
- Don' t forget, look 'em in the eye.
There' s two numbers missing on your Social Security.
Uh... 12.
1- 2.
It says here you' ve got four years' experience.
- Yes.
- All on computers?
Yes.
Where did you go to school?
It was called George Washington.
Oh, GW?
My brother- in- law got his doctorate there.
- Did you pledge?
- Yes.
Every morning.
It happened again!
David, the girl is absolutely useless.
I need someone who knows what she is doing.
Excuse me.
I' m not getting my mail.
Nothing has been filed.
Ever since she got engaged, my life has been a disaster.
She came so highly recommended.
She spent three months writing down her married name.
Mrs Judy Hicks.
Mrs Donald Hicks.
Mrs Judy Mitchelson Hicks - sometimes with a hyphen, sometimes without.
- (snorts)
- Well, I really don' t know where I can put her.
- Put her on unemployment!
- When can you start?
- Soon.
We' il start you off with last week' s preschool orders.
It should take a few days - give you a chance to find your way around.
- Do you smoke?
- Well, just, uh... once.
Only on breaks, and in the coffee room.
Most of that' s pretty straightforward stuff.
Any questions, come to me.
Good luck!
Bye!
"The Dinky Link."
"Seven."
- Psst!
- Psst!
Psst.
- I' m Scott Brennen.
I' m Josh Baskin.
What are you trying to do?
- Huh?
- You gotta slow down, pace yourself.
- Slow.
- Sorry.
- Today' s my first day.
- I know!
- So how long have you worked here?
- Five years.
The work stinks, but the fringe benefits are great.
See that girl over there in the red?
Say hi to her and she' s yours.
She' il wrap her legs round you so tight, you' il be begging for mercy.
Well, I' il stay away from her, then!
Excuse me.
Brennen.
I gave it to you yesterday!
Oh, here it is.
I don' t have time to Xerox it.
- Bullshit!
- But the favourability ratings...
Let' s not lie to ourselves.
If a kid likes a toy, it sells, that' s all.
- But every bit of research...
- It worked in the research, not with the kids!
- Sorry.
- Watch where you' re going!
- Are you OK?
- I am fine.
- You could kill somebody!
- (boss) It' s all right.
The boss should get knocked on his ass once in a while.
- Maybe you should see a doctor.
- For crying out loud, Paul, I' m fine!
- Sorry, sir.
- Where were you going, son?
Oh!
That' s good!
Nothing wrong with a little hustle.
Nothing at all.
Right, Paul?
What did he mean?
I hustle.
Uh, sir?
Sir!
Hello?
- Hello?
- Hello.
- Mrs Baskin?
- Yes?
- How are you?
- Who is this?
Josh is all right.
I mean, he' s OK and everything.
Do you have my boy?
And you' re gonna get him back - just the way he was.
Look, I swear to God, if you do anything to him, if you touch one hair on his head,..... l will spend the rest of my life making sure you suffer.
Wow!
Thanks.
- Let me talk to Josh.
- Oh, he can' t come to the phone right now.
- Why not?
What did you do to him?
- I- I didn' t do anything.
He' s a terrific kid.
(tearful) I want proof that he' s all right.
Uh... all right.
Um... ask me something that... that... that only he would know.
Then I' il ask him for you, and that way, you' il know that he' s OK.
Ask him what I used to sing to him when he was a little boy.
- Is there anything else you' d rather ask him?
- Ask him.
I got it!
I got it.
Look, you' re gonna see him again - really soon.
I- I promise.
I... cross my heart and hope to...
Uh... we' il talk about this later.
Get down!
Get out of the area!
- Ferris.
- Thank you.
Brennen.
Baskin.
- Payday.
- (man) Hey, whoa!
Where' s mine? - $187?
- Oh!
They really screw you, don' t they?
- Hi.
- Hi.
OK...
So how would you like that?
OK.
All right.
Three dimes, a $100 bill, and 87 ones.
One, two, three...
I' m never eating again.
- It wasn' t that bad.
- It was the boat ride that did it.
It was the pork rinds.
Pork rinds!
- We sure had fun, didn' t we?
Yeah, we sure did.
Keep away from strange men.
(boy) Gotcha!
- What' s your name?
- Joey.
What' s yours?
- My name' s Josh.
- I' m gonna blow you away, Josh.
- I just got you!
- No way!
That' s bullshit.
Get back here!
(old woman) You big dork!
You work for me, don' t you?
Yes.
I thought so.
Are you here with your kids?
No...
- Oh...
Me, too.
I come here every Saturday.
You can' t see this on a marketing report.
What' s a marketing report?
Exactly.
Come on.
- What do you think of that?
- The championship hockey?
- Ooh, I love it.
Only, the....
- Only, what?
- Well, the pieces don' t move.
- What do you mean?
- Well, on the old set,..... you could slide the men up and down the ice.
Now all they do is spin around.
It was more like real hockey the old way.
Why' d they change it?
I don' t know.
The Starfighters are good - you can change all the pieces around.
But I never liked the Galacticons.
You only get one robot, and there' s no vehicle.
I see.
- Plus, you can' t take 'em underwater.
- And if you do, they...
Neat!
OK, uh... let' s check out the...
- Piano lessons?
- Three years.
Me, too.
Every day - after school.
"Chopsticks".
- What department are you in?
- Computers.
Yeah...
You just saved me a trip to the gym, son.
According to the marketability studies, this thing should go straight through the roof.
Hey!
Watch it, fella.
- Sorry.
Vice president, in charge of product development.
He' s only been here a week!
Vice president?
And he came from Data Processing.
He' s outta his mind.
The old man has finally lost it!
- Bob' s...
Bob' s office is bigger than my office!
There' s gotta be a reason.
Things like this don' t happen without a reason.
- If the president dies, you take over?
- No, they got a hundred of 'em.
- Yes, Mr Baskin.
- Thank you.
Come on in.
It' s bigger than the principal' s office.
- How do you know?
- Remember that explosion in science?
- Oh, yeah.
- Track- a- pillar!
59. 95!
You know, that only costs ten bucks to make.
Get outta here!
- What is this?
They just put this in here.
- So what do they make you do for all this?
- Well, I play with all of this stuff,..... and then I go in and I tell 'em what I think.
- That' s it?
- Yeah.
- And they pay you for that?
- Yeah.
Suckers!
Thank you, Miss Patterson.
Miss Patterson!
Could you get Media to send up the video of the Super Bowl?
And have 'em edit out all the commercials?
- Yes, Mr Baskin.
- Thanks.
Miss Patterson.
You' re the luckiest guy I know!
- Did you check Mattel?
- Nothing.
- Coleco?
- Zero.
He can' t come from nowhere, Susan.
How about Hasbro?
Yes, and Fisher Price and Worlds of Wonder.
I have called everywhere.
- Nobody' s ever heard of him!
- Great (!)
Let' s face it, Paul, the guy comes from Data Processing.
(Paul) Terrific!
This is just terrific (!)
You' re being paranoid, Paul.
(Paul) These tests were conducted over a six- month period,..... using a double- blind format of eight overlapping demographic groups.
Every region of the country was sampled.
The focus testing... showed a solid base..... in the 9 - to 11- year- old bracket,..... with a possible carry- over into the 12- year- olds.
- (Josh) I' m sorry... and that we are targeting the same area,..... I think that we should see one quarter of that.
And that is one fifth of the total revenue from all of last year.
- Excellent, Paul.
- Thank you, thank you, thank you.
- Any questions?
- Not for me.
Yes?
- Yes?
- I don' t get it.
What exactly... don' t you get?
It turns from a building into a robot, right?
Precisely.
Well, what' s fun about that?
Well, if you' d read your industry breakdown,..... you' d see that our success in the action- figure area..... has climbed from 27 per cent to 45 per cent in the last two years.
There, that might help.
- Yes?
I still don' t get it.
What?
- What don' t you get, Josh?
- Well...
There' s a million robots that turn into something.
This is a building that turns into a robot.
What' s fun about playing with that?
- This is a skyscraper.
- Well, couldn' t it be, like,..... a robot that turns into... into something - like a... like a bug or something?
- A bug?
- Yeah.
- In teresting.
- A prehistoric Transformer?
- (Paul) Gentlemen...
- The robot turns into a bug?
- Uh, gentlemen, listen...
- He' s got a very good idea here!
- The robot turns into a bug!
-.. different sizes...
- We could do ladybugs.
- (Josh) You could have 'em wreck buildings.
- A building is inert, a bug moves!
- It' s got all kinds of possibilities.
- This doesn' t just happen.
- Uh...
- Well done, Josh.
Well done.
Oh, he is vicious!
- He' s not vicious.
- Don' t kid yourself.
That man is a killer!
- All he said was he didn' t get it.
- (mocking) "I don' t get it."
"Let' s make it a bug."
He' s going for the throat.
He' s trying to eviscerate me.
(frustrated grunts) Did you see the look on MacMillan' s face?
It' s a unique space.
The lines are so clean, and there' s none of that partition quality.
It has 15- foot ceilings, uh... all hardwood floors, ample closet space,..... a modern kitchen, a brand- new bathroom with a jet- stream Jacuzzi.
We' il take it!
Baskin.
Rental delivery.
Come on, come on!
- (splash) - That was so close!
(Josh) "Dear...
Mom and Dad,..... They said..... that I could write you... and let you know I was OK. "
"So far... they' re treating me fine."
"I got enough to eat,..... and am perfectly safe."
I' il get out of here..... in about... a month. "
"In the meantime,..... it' s a lot like camp."
"I watch TV,...
I got it!
I got it!
I got it!.. and even... get outside..... once in a while. "
"I know... you miss me,..... but try not to worry."
"I think... this experience... might even be good for me."
I' il see you soon. "
"Your son,..... Joshua."
"PS..... Give Rachel a kiss from her big brother."
(piano) (Scott) We got off on the wrong foot.
- I' m having a lovely time.
- I' m delighted, Miss Patterson.
It' s much better than last year.
I just wanted to tell you that.
- Double up on the scotch, will ya?
- Right away, sir.
- S...
- Love your tux.
I think it' s the same as the maître d' s.
Have you decided what you' re doing on the Danberry line?
No.
I haven' t.
I think if you got everyone' s input upfront,...
-.. I mean, right from the beginning...
- Susan... have a drink.
- What?
- Have a couple of drinks.
It' s a party.
Oh, God!
Josh!
Glad you could make it.
- I bet he gets another raise.
- Now that' s what I call a tuxedo!
I rented it.
This is a real bow tie, though - I tied it myself.
- That' s why I was late.
- You' re not late.
Let me show you around.
Hey, there' s Miss Patterson.
There' s the guy from the meeting!
.. it only works on your hips.
You need a whole 'nother exercise for your thighs.
Hi.
Let me grab a plate here.
Excuse me.
The guy' s a goddamn knock- off artist.
Amphibian?
He takes 10, 000 Gl Joes,..... slaps some gills on 'em, webs their feet, packages them in seaweed.
Come on!
(Paul) So I show him the schedule, and he says "It' s not correct accounting procedure."
- The goddamn prick!
- But the toy sold, Paul.
Excuse me.
- Hi.
- Hi.
All the same people, having all the same discussion.
It' s like they cloned some party in 1983..... and kept spinning it out, again and again and again.
- I loved your ideas on the Squeezy Doll line.
- Thanks.
They were so... incisive.
It' s beluga.
MacMillan orders it every year.
Sidle up to him and then ask for a raise.
Gesundheit.
All right?
- (spluttering continues) - Are you OK?
Do you want a glass of water?
- Do you want something to drink?
- Could I have a milk shake or something?
Wanna get outta here?
- Uh- huh.
- Let' s go.
Watch it!
I' m not really a big one for parties.
I like things that are a little more, uh... intimate.
Wow!
Is this your car?
Well, it' s the company' s car.
Oh, this is the coolest thing I' ve ever seen!
Sir.
Just seeing someone in the office, you don' t really get a chance to know them.
- (sucking) -.. of who you are.
- Are you gonna eat these?
- Hey, mister?
You want some of these fries?
No, thank you.
No.
See, it' s hard in a business situation.
I mean, there' s... there' s this invisible line, and, uh..... even if... even if you' re attracted to someone...
- You' re gonna call someone before...?
- (twiddling radio tuner)
Don' t play with the ra...
Leave the, uh...
Don' t...
I' m really vulnerable right now!
And I...
- (radio plays "Hot in the City" by Billy Idol) - I mean, I love my job, and... -.. and I...
This is great!
Hey!
Come on up!
- That was my apartment.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- I' d love to see where you live.
Have you always lived alone?
- No.
- Oh.
Is it just recently, or...
- Yeah...
- Give yourself a couple of days, it' il pass.
Well, they said it was gonna take six weeks.
(laughs)
- (Josh) Watch your step.
- Thank you.
I' m not sure we should do this yet.
- Do what?
- Well, I...
I wanna spend the night with you...
D' you mean sleep over?
Well..... yeah!
OK.
But I get to be on top.
- You live here?
- Yeah.
It' s nice, isn' t it?
Yeah...
You, uh... you want a soda?
- A soda.
You want one?
- Yeah.
Sure.
I rigged this up so you don' t need any quarters.
Oh!
No... no, don' t.
- What?
- The glue is not dry yet.
Sorry.
- Sorry!
- It' s OK.
You didn' t break anything.
- You wanna play pinball?
- No.
- You don' t need quarters for this either.
- No, thank you.
OK.
- Is that a trampoline?
- Yeah.
You wanna try it?
No!
You should.
It' s really fun.
It' s simple, too.
Come on.
Come on.
- You' il like it.
It' s easy, too.
- Do you have some wine?
- Take off your shoes.
- Maybe we could talk for a few minutes.
Jesus!
Gimme the other one.
OK.
Now watch.
It' s really simple.
Let me just get my big balls off here.
I' il watch.
- Come on.
It' s fun!
I' il do it with you.
Excellent.
- Help me up?
- Sure.
OK... jump.
- You want me to jump?
- Yeah.
Just jump.
- There.
Now we can have a drink.
- No, no, no, no, no!
Really jump.
Go ahead.
Get some air between you and the tramp -..... oline.
- There.
- Oh, come on!
I' il do it with you, all right?
Ready?
OK, jump.
See?
Just this - that' s all there is...
That' s all there is to it.
Good.
Good.
There you go.
There you go.
Yeah!
It' s easy!
Anybody could do this.
Hello!
How do you do that?
Good!
Hi.
- Here.
- What?
- Pick one.
(giggles) OK, try again.
That one.
It' s for you.
It' s a glow- in- the- dark compass ring, so you won' t get lost.
Good night.
(Paul) Had fun last night?
- Sure.
Yeah.
Yeah, you left pretty quick.
- I gave him a ride home, Paul.
- Oh!
Did he enjoy it?
- Don' t be ridiculous.
- That' s me, Mr Ridiculous (!)
Mr Silly Old Guy!
I don' t feel like going out tonight.
What do you mean?
They' re your friends.
I know.
- (retunes radio) - Leave it!
Will you quit it?
- (Paul retunes radio) - You have to play with everything?
Baskin?
Baskin?
Wouldn' t you rather play basketball?
We could be a team for the MacMillan company.
- No.
- My best sport' s video hockey.
- It' s not a sport.
- It takes eye- to- hand coordination.
- It' s not a sport if you don' t sweat!
- What about golf?
That' s a sport.
- Yeah, a machine doesn' t do all the work.
- What about car racing?
- Ah, shut up, Baskin!
- What are the rules again?
I told you.
Over the line on the serve, yellow is out of bounds, play to 21.
Ready?
Sorry...
Sorry.
- One- nothing!
- Hold it.
Go!
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it!
Attaboy!
- Yeah.
Nice try!
- That was in.
Two- zip.
Just made it.
Ready?
Here we go!
That was in.
Good.
Point.
- (Paul) What' s the matter?
Backhand.
Yes!
- 19- 18.
- That was under the line.
- What?
- You said it had to be over the line.
- No, I didn' t.
- You said it had to be over on a serve.
No, I did not!
Now gimme the goddamn ball!
- That' s cheating!
- Gimme the goddamn ball, will ya?
- No.
- Gimme the ball, you little shit!
- It' s my serve.
- Gimme the ball!
- Gimme the goddamn ball!
- Yes, you did.
Gimme...
Gimme the ball.
Gimme the ball!
Give me the ball.
- You' re a cheater.
- I do not cheat.
Give me the ball.
Give me the ball!
Gimme the...
Gimme the ball!
All right.
But let' s take it over.
We' il take it over!
- He didn' t have to punch me.
- I know.
He' s scared of you.
- You don' t play his game.
- I tried to play his game.
He beat me up.
If he' s scared of me, then why did he punch me?
He punched you because he' s scared of you.
- I don' t get it.
- It' s just the way he is.
Everything' s a fight with him.
Everyone' s an enemy.
It' s not just a job for him, it' s a war.
Then how come you' re so nice?
What?
You work as hard as he does and you' re not like that.
You don' t know me that well.
Yes, I do.
You' re one of the nicest people I' ve met.
How do you do it?
- What' s this?
-.. two ties and an exercise tape.
- Susan...
Oh, and I want my keys back.
Sure.
He' il get over it.
It' s nothing to do with him.
- He' s just another link in the chain!
First it was, uh, Tom Caulfield, then Hanlen, then Golding, then me.
- Am I missing somebody?
- It' s not like that any more.
What is so special about Baskin?
He' s a grown- up.
Susan...
I can' t believe you brought up Golding.
Catch.
Catch the dough.
Catch.
How many pieces of dough we got here?
Here they come!
Throw me the ball.
My God!
He got it!
He' s really good!
- Happy birthday to you - (Billy) Surprise!
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Josh
Happy birthday to you
And many more!
(waiter) Happy birthday to you.
- Hey.
What are you gonna wish for this time?
I know, we can get some beers, some dirty magazines...
- Um...
I can' t, Billy.
It' s your birthday.
- Where?
Where?
Well, I have to go meet somebody, and...
- You got all night.
- Yeah, I know, but...
See, I just...
Well, I can' t right now, OK?
But I' il call you, all right?
OK?
I' il give you a call.
Oh, and thanks again, Billy.
It was fun.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Do you wanna come in?
- Sure.
Sit down.
- Yeah!
Yeah.
Wanna go again?
They have cars that you can drive, except they' re on a rail.
- Like a coaster ride.
- So you' re not really...
- You have a big gob of mustard right there.
- What?
- Mustard.
- Where?
Right there.
- Is it gone?
Well...
Here.
- That... gone?
- Yeah.
- Listen.
Oh, music?
Wanna dance?
Dance?
- We don' t have to if you don' t want to.
- OK.
- All right.
- OK.
- Mm- mm.
We could get some hot chocolate.
You can wear my jacket if you want.
(nervous laugh)
What were you like when you were younger?
- Oh, well, I wasn' t much different.
- (laughs) I believe that about you.
I' ve been thinking about you a lot.
It' s... crazy.
In my car,..... lying in bed...
I' ve just never gone out with someone like you.
With all the other men, there was so much to hide.
I feel like I can tell you anything.
Susan?
Susan...
There' s something I think I should tell you.
What?
You want the light on?
- Good morning, Mr Baskin.
- Good morning.
Hey, Brett, how are ya?
- Hi, everybody.
- (woman) Hi, Josh.
Josh, my man!
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Good morning, sir.
- I' d like some coffee, please, Miss Patterson.
- But you don' t drink coffee!
- And, uh... make it black.
You know, you two should come to Vermont.
It is so pretty up there right now.
- (husband) We spent our anniversary there.
- All you did was watch TV!
I popped popcorn, too.
We watched that intellectual stuff, you know.
Did anybody see that great documentary about Columbus on PBS the other night?
- (Susan) Mm- mm.
- (woman) Um, no.
- I had no idea he had a fourth ship.
- Yeah, the Santa Cristina.
- That' s right.
- He only had that on his second trip.
- You saw it, too.
- No.
- But I- I used to... study, you know, that stuff.
- Really?
I need some help with my algebra.
- Not now, Adam.
- Yeah, but, Dad...
- Adam, we have guests.
(Mom) He has had the roughest time with algebra.
- We' ve tried tutors, everything.
- With algebra?
- I used to study that, too.
- (Mom) Isn' t that nice?
Let' s say Larry Bird' s gonna score ten points in the first quarter.
- How many will he score in the whole game?
- 40 points.
- Probably, OK?
And that' s algebra.
- Right.
- But, it is...?
- Yeah.
One quarter is to ten points that he scores in that quarter.
Just as four...
You' re right.
He' s wonderful.
I know.
"Department of Consumer Affairs"?
Yeah, buddy!
It came!
(executive) He' s never done this before.
Get the art department on the phone.
Get them, get them!
- Send out for some sandwiches.
- Cajun or deli?
Maybe next year, Brian.
Next year.
- You can do it.
- I cannot plan a whole line!
Why?
Nobody knows more about toys than you.
Susan, doing that means marketing and strategy and stuff like that!
- I can' t...
I' il handle the marketing.
- But...
- Come on, it' il be neat.
Well, I...
I don' t have any ideas for new toys or anything.
Yeah, well, tell him I called again.
- (Miss Patterson) I' il tell him, Mr...
- Kopeche.
K- O- P...
- You know, he' s been very busy.
- Yeah, right (!)
Well, tell him it' s important.
See, it won' t be like these, where you just follow the story along.
You would actually make a whole different story appear, just by pressing these buttons.
An electronic comic book?
That' s amazing!
Like a living comic book.
It' il be different every time.
This is incredible.
You' re brilliant.
If you like one, you could see it over and over and over again.
You' re wonderful.
Do you really like it?
- Really?
- Really.
- You think Mac will like it?
- I think...
You know what we can do?
We could do, like, sports comic books,..... where, like, if you' re going to steal second or something like that.
We could have sports books - baseball, football...
What...
What...
Huh?
What' s going on here?
Well... you know, we' re...
Something wrong?
- You don' t like it?
- No!
No.
It' s...
I mean, if it' s an affair, that' s one thing.
But if it' s...
If it' s something else...
Not that we have to know right now.
But if we think that it could turn into something else,..... well...
How do you feel about all this?
How do I feel about what?
Well, how do... how do you... feel about me?
What is that supposed to mean?
Wednesday would be better than Thursday.
- Mr Baskin can' t be...
- Yeah, I have the key example right here.
Where you been?
I' ve been trying to reach you!
I' m in the middle of something, OK?
- I got the list.
- Can you give me a minute, please?
Yes.
This is it.
This is the list!
Would you come back at lunch?
I' m a little bit busy right now.
- Hello?
- Busy?
- Billy!
- Are you outta your mind?
- Jesus, Billy!
Miss Patterson!
- It' s what we' ve been waiting for!
I got work to do, can' t you understand that?
I got a deadline to meet.
I' m your best friend.
What' s more important than that, huh?
And I' m three months older than you are, asshole!
"You are standing in the cavern of the evil wizard."
"All around you are the carcasses of slain ice dwarfs."
"Melt wizard."
"What do you want to melt him with?"
"Throw thermal pod."
- (woman) Boys!
- (boy) Just five more minutes.
Josh?
What' s wrong?
What is it?
I haven' t told you something because I didn' t think you' d believe me,..... and I didn' t think you' d like me any more, so...
Oh, honey, come here!
You can tell me anything.
What?
Susan, I' m not what you think I am.
What do you mean?
Um...
I was in Little League,..... and I rode my bike to school, and I played with my friends and hung out...
Josh, what are... what are you talking about?
I wanna go home.
I miss my family, Susan, and I wanna go home.
Oh, my God!
You' re married!
- No!
No...
- I knew this was too good to be true.
- There had to be something!
Susan, I' m not married.
- You' re not?
- No.
I' m a child.
What?
I' m a child, Susan.
I' m not ready for all of this!
Oh, that' s fine.
That' s just great (!)
- What happened...
- No, I understand.
- No!
No, you don' t understand.
I' m 13 years old.
- Oh, and who isn' t?
You think there isn' t a frightened kid inside of me?
No, I mean I really am thirteen!
I went to bed one night and I was a kid, and when I woke up, I was a grown- up.
Oh, right (!) And just yesterday, I was a schoolgirl with pigtails (!)
- Why are you doing this?
- There was a carnival...
- Please!
- I made a wish on the Zoltar machine.
Oh, stop it!
The Zoltar machine had this bobbing head that looked just like a devil!
If you got a quarter in his mouth, you could make a wish.
I did!
I made a wish to be big.
What I' m trying to tell you is, I changed into a grown- up, but I' m really just a kid!
Fine, Josh.
You' re a kid.
Look, I don' t know what it is that you' re trying to tell me,..... but we have a very big presentation to give tomorrow, so I' m gonna get some sleep.
Stupid stuff!
Dumb stuff!
Some friend!
I don' t need him.
Stupid jacket!
Josh?
Josh!
Hi, Mrs Baskin.
Hiya.
I was just looking around in here.
- Your hair' s getting longer.
- I got it cut yesterday.
He had a birthday.
I know.
He' il be coming back real soon.
Everything' s gonna be OK.
- I hope so.
- Good night.
Right there!
Sea Point Park, New York.
Well?
- Yes?
- (Miss Patterson) They' re waiting for you.
Thanks.
See you around.
There' s this flat screen on the inside with pictures on it.
You read it, and when you get to the bottom, you have to make a choice..... of what the character' s gonna do - if he' s gonna fight the dragon, you push a button.
- Paul?
- I don' t get it.
- Well...
- (Mac) Paul!
- It' s a comic book...
- See, there' s a computer chip inside,..... which stores the choices.
At the end of a page, you decide where the story goes.
- That' s the point.
- Terrific, Susan.
- (Susan) The kid makes his own decision.
- (Mac) This is possible?
Yeah!
In fact, it' s a very simple program.
Isn' t that right?
(Paul) So what happens when you run out of choices?
(Susan) That' s the great thing.
You can sell different adventures.
Just pop in a brand- new disk, and you get a whole new set of options.
- (Susan) Mm- hm.
I' il be right back.
(Mac) How much would the unit cost?
Well, our initial figure was around, uh... seven..... around seven dollars,..... with a retail cost of about... 18. 95.
Well, you expect a kid to pay $19 for a comic book?
I think a kid...
Will you excuse me?
Josh?
Josh!
Will you take me to Sea Point Park, New York?
Sea Point Park?
Josh!
- Not so fast!
- Here.
Josh!
Josh!
See you back home!
Yeah!
Excuse me.
You know Josh?
Yeah.
- Look, you have to tell me where he went.
- Who are you?
- I' m...
- I' m his girlfriend.
- Billy Kopeche.
- You have to tell me where he went.
Please, tell me.
Tell me!
Work, damn it!
- Josh?
- Susan!
You know, you don' t walk out on somebody.
You don' t do that!
I know.
I' m really sorry.
I...
I didn' t know what to say.
Oh, God!
You got your wish.
- I tried to tell you...
- I didn' t listen.
- I tried to tell you. -.. or want to!
Even if I did listen...
- I' ve been thinking about this.
I' ve been...
There' s a million reasons for me to go home, but there' s only one reason for me to stay.
What reason is that?
Well..... you!
Come on.
Come on, come on!
So, uh... what are you?
Fifteen?
Sixteen?
I' m thirteen.
Well, that explains it!
Maybe you could come with me.
No!
No...
Why not?
I' ve been there before.
It' s hard enough the first time.
You know what I mean?
You don' t know what I mean.
Come on, I' il drive you home.
- I' m sorry.
- No, I' il be OK.
You' il be fine.
In ten years, who knows?
Maybe you should hold onto my number.
So this is where you live?
- Which one is it?
- That one right there, just... (Susan) Oh.
That' s nice.
I' m gonna miss you.
I' m gonna miss you, too.
- You won' t even remember me.
- Oh, yes, I will.
Mom?
- Mom!
- Josh?
- It' s me!
- Josh?
Josh!
Oh, my God!
Oh, thank God you' re home!
I missed you all so much.
- (Josh) I' m just not good enough.
- What are you talking about?
You hit the ball over the fence almost every time in stickball.
- (both chuckle)
- (Josh) You really think I could do it?
- Yeah!
- (Josh) Come on, we' il hit some after supper.
I' il call for ya.
Choose a career, a family.
Choose washing machines, cars, compact disc players.
Low cholesterol and dental insurance.
Choose mortgage repayments.
Choose a home.
Choose your friends!
Choose leisurewear and matching luggage.
Choose a three- piece suite on hire purchase!
Wondering who the fuck you are on a Sunday morning.
Stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth.
'Choose rotting away at the end,
'in a miserable home,
'Choose your future.
'Choose life.'
But why would I want to do a thing like that?
I chose not to choose life.
I chose something else.
And the reasons?
There are no reasons.
Who needs reasons when you' ve got heroin?
Goldfinger' s better than Dr No.
Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds Are Forever.
A judgement reflected in its relatively poor showing at the box office.
'People think it' s all about misery
'which is not to be ignored.'
Fuck off!
'But what they forget...
All dead!
White meat!
You prick!
'Otherwise, we wouldn' t do it.'
- You want me to do it?
- Yes.
Pure as driven snow, that shit.
'Or at least, we' re not that fucking stupid.'
'and you' re still nowhere near it.'
Oh, it beats any meat injection!
That beats any fucking cock in the world!
'When you' re on junk, you' ve only one worry - scoring.
'When you' re off it, you worry about all sorts of shite.
'Can' t get a bird.
Got a bird, too much hassle.
'some football team that never wins.
'when you have a sincere, truthful junk habit.'
I' d say in those days he was a muscular actor.
With all the presence of someone like Cooper or Lancaster combined with a sly wit... to make him a formidable lead.
And closer in that respect to Cary Grant.
'The principal drawback is you have to endure cunts saying...'
No way would I poison my body with that shite.
All they fucking chemicals?
No fucking way!
Poisoning your body with that shite.
Every chance you' ve had, son, you' ve blown it.
Stuffing your veins with that filth!
'From time to time, even I have uttered the magic words.'
I' m off the skag.
Are you serious?
I' m finished.
- It' s up to you.
I want off it for good.
- The Sick Boy method.
- It really worked for him.
- Well, he lacks moral fibre.
- He' s a Sean Connery expert.
- That' s hardly a substitute.
- You' il need one more hit.
- I don' t think so.
For the long night ahead.
'We called him Mother Superior
'on account of the length of his habit.
'Of course I' d have another shot.
I had work to do. '
Relinquishing junk, stage one - preparation.
For this you will need: a room which you won' t leave, soothing music.
Tomato soup, ten tins of; mushroom soup, eight tins of - for consumption cold.
Ice- cream - vanilla, one large tub of.
Magnesia, Milk of - one bottle.
Mineral water,
Lucozade, pornography.
Buckets for urine, faeces and vomitus.
One television and one bottle of valium procured from my mother who is, in her own domestic and socially acceptable way, also a drug addict.
Now I' m ready.
I just need one final hit to soothe the pain till the valium takes effect.
Mikey?
Yeah, it' s Mark Renton.
I wondered, could you help me out?
'This was typical of Mikey Forrester.'
What the fuck are these?
'Normally, I have nothing to do with him
'but things were not normal.'
Ideal for your purposes.
Custom fucking designed for your needs.
I want a fucking hit!
Take it or leave it.
Feelin 'better now?
I might as well have stuck them up my arse.
Heroin makes you constipated.
The heroin from my last hit is fading away and the suppositories have yet to melt.
I' m no longer constipated.
I fantasize about a massive, pristine convenience.
Brilliant gold taps, virginal white marble, a seat carved from ebony, a cistern full of Chanel No. 5, a flunky handing me pieces of silk toilet roll.
I' il settle for anywhere.
Yes, ya fucking dancer!
Now I' m ready.
The downside of coming off junk was mixing with my friends again in a state of full consciousness.
They were so like me, I could hardly bear to look at them.
Sick Boy came off junk too, just to show me how easily he could do it.
When all I wanted to do was feel sorry for myself, he insisted on telling me his theory of life.
What d' you mean?
Well, at one point you' ve got it, then you lose it.
All walks of life.
Georgie Best, for example, had it - lost it.
Or David Bowie or Lou Reed.
His solo stuff' s not bad.
But it' s not great either.
And in your heart you know that although it sounds all right, it' s actually just... shite.
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren,
- OK, OK.
What' s the point you' re making?
All I' m trying to do, Mark, is to help you understand that The Name Of The Rose is merely a blip on an otherwise uninterrupted downward trajectory.
I don' t rate that at all.
Despite the Academy Award?
That means fuck all.
It' s a sympathy vote.
Yeah.
That' s your theory?
Yeah.
Beautifully fucking illustrated.
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.
Have you got the beast in your sights?
This should present no significant problems.
For a vegetarian, Rents, you' re a fucking evil shot!
'Without heroin,
'I led a useful and fulfilling life as a good citizen.'
- Good luck, Spud.
- Cheers, Cat- boy.
If they think you' re no tryin ', you' re doomed.
They' il be on to the DSS and your giro' s fucking finished, right?
- Right.
- But try too hard...
- You might get the job!
- Exactly.
- Nightmare!
- It' s a tightrope, Spud.
A fucking tightrope!
I get pure shy with the interviewer cats.
I get nerves, like footballers on big occasions.
Try some of this.
Some speed - just the ticket, man.
I put Royal Edinburgh College to help get the job.
There' s too much discrimination here.
They' re both schools, right.
I put across the idea.
People get hung up on details.
Like how many O- grades I got.
Maybe none.
What' s important is that I am.
No... Well, yes.
To get my foot in the door.
Showing initiative.
You were referred by the Department of Employment.
Your foot was in the door.
Yeah, cool.
You' re the man.
Obviously.
What exactly attracts you to the leisure industry?
In a word, pleasure.
Like, my pleasure in other people' s leisure.
Do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?
I' m a bit of a perfectionist.
For me, it' s the best or nothin 'at all.
Things get dodgy - I cannot be bothered.
But I' m getting good vibes about this interview.
Seems to me it' s going pretty well, eh?
Thank you, Mr Murphy.
We' il let you know.
The pleasure was mine.
'Spud had done well.
'He made me proud.
Fucked up good and proper. '
Picture the scene.
The other fucking week there, down the Volley with Tommy playing pool.
I' m playing like Paul Newman, giving the boy a tanning.
It comes to the last shot, the deciding ball of the tournament.
I' m on the black, he looks biscuit- arsed.
When this hard cunt comes in.
Starts staring at me.
Looking right fucking at me as if to say, "Come ahead."
I' m not the type that goes looking for bother but I had a pool cue and he' d get it in his puss!
So I squares up, casual like.
The so- called hard cunt?
Shites it!
Puts down his drink and gets the fuck out of there.
And after that... well, the game was mine.
'And that was it.
'That was Begbie' s story.
'Or Begbie' s version of the story.
'Later, I got the truth from Tommy.
'You always got the truth from Tommy.
'never cheated on anyone.'
It was Wednesday morning.
We were in the Volley, playing pool.
That' s true.
But Begbie is playing absolutely fucking gash.
His hangover' s so bad, he can hardly hold the fucking cue!
I' m doing my best to lose, trying to humour him.
But every time I touch a ball, I pot something.
Every time Begbie goes near the table, he fucks it up.
Fuck' s sake...!
So, he' s got the hump.
But I set him up to pot the black, win one game, salvage his pride and not kick me in.
So, he' s on the black...
'Pressure shot...
'which goes wrong, big time.'
'He picks on this wee gadge,
'accusing him of putting him off.
'He hadn' t even glanced at us.'
- Fuck off!
- 'He' d have chibbed him.'
Then I thought he was gonna do me.
The beggar' s fucking psycho.
But he' s a mate.
- What can you do?
- Can I borrow this?
'What indeed could one do?
'Try not to get involved.'
'Begbie didn' t do drugs.
He did people.
'He got off on it.
His own sensory addiction. '
Nobody move!
No cunt moves till we know who did it.
Yes!
'As I sat watching
'I realised that something was missing from my life.'
No joy yet.
Six weeks.
Six weeks!
Nightmare right.
She told me she didn' t want our relationship to start out on a physical basis as that is how it principally is going to be defined from then on.
She read it in Cosmopolitan.
Six weeks and no sex?
I' ve got balls like fucking watermelons I' m telling you.
- I read it in Cosmopolitan.
- Interesting theory.
Actually, it' s a nightmare.
I' m desperate for a shag but watching him suffer was just too much fun.
Try it wi 'Tommy.
It' s the only pleasure I get from him!
- You know about my birthday?
He forgot.
Useless motherfucker!
Useless motherfucker; that' s what she called me.
I said to her, look I' m sorry but these things happen, let' s put it behind us.
That' s fair enough.
Was she upset?
Very, "It' s me or Iggy Pop, time to decide."
Football.
What are you talking about?
Shopping.
'The situation was becoming serious.
'as in all others, segregated themselves from the failures.'
'Heroin had robbed Renton of his sex drive
'but now it returned with a vengeance.
'and desperation took a hold on his sex- crazed mind.
'taunted him with his own unsatisfied desire.
'Dot, dot, dot.'
'Mark Renton had fallen in love.'
Excuse me.
I don' t mean to harrass you but I was very impressed with the way you dealt with that situation.
- Thanks.
- Diane.
Where are you going?
- Where' s that?
It' s where I live.
- What?
I' il come back with you but I' m not promising anything.
Does this approach usually work?
Or have you never tried it before?
You don' t normally approach girls, right?
Witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal...
Taxi!
A little bit crazy, a little bit bad.
But hey, don' t us girls just love that (!)
Well?
Cat got your tongue?
I left something...
Are you getting in?
Do you understand?
You will be a considerate and thoughtful lover.
Generous... but firm.
Failure on your part to live up to these very reasonable expectations will result in swift resumption of a non- sex situation.
Right?
What?
Shut up!
Wake up, Spud.
Wake up.
Sex!
Casual sex!
What?
I wanna watch ourselves while we' re screwing.
So let' s see what I' m missing.
Not much!
'picking it up from the outside...
'He' s going all the way... and he scores!
'Oh, what a magnificent goal!
'Gemmill at his very best.
'What a penetrating goal that was.'
I haven' t felt that good since Archie Gemmill scored against Holland in 1978.
Right.
You can' t sleep here.
- What?
Come on!
You can sleep on the hall sofa or go home.
And don' t make any noise.
Jesus!
Gone?
- Where has it gone?
- It' il be here somewhere!
I might' ve returned it by mistake.
Returned it?!
Where?
The video shop, Tommy?
The fucking video shop?!
So every punter in Edinburgh' s jerking off to our video?
Oh, God, Tommy, I feel sick!
- Hi.
- Hello.
Come in and sit down.
Aye.
You must be Mark.
Aye, that' s me.
Are you a friend of Diane' s?
- More a friend of a friend.
Are you her flatmates, like?
Flatmates?!
I must remember that one.
Morning.
Good morning, Spud.
Mr Houston.
Mrs Houston.
Mornin ', Spud.
Sit down and have some breakfast.
I' m sorry about last night, by the way.
I slept fine on the sofa.
Had a bit of an accident.
Dinnae worry.
Does a man good to cut loose once in a while.
This one could do with being tied up.
I' il get the sheets washed.
I' il wash them.
No need.
- It' s no problem.
- Or for me.
- I' d rather take care of it.
- Really...
- No!
- Spud, they' re my sheets!
- Why not?
- Because it' s illegal.
What, holding hands?
- No, not holding hands.
- You were quite happy
- to do a lot more last night.
- That' s what' s illegal!
Inside, they' d cut my balls off.
- You' re not going to jail.
- Easy for you to say.
- Certainly not!
If you don' t see me again, I' il tell the police.
I' il see you around.
Now what?
We' re going for a walk.
A walk!
- Where?
- There!
Are you serious?
Well, what are you waitin 'for?
Tommy... this is not natural, man.
It' s the great outdoors!
Fresh air!
Don' t take it out on us.
Makes you proud to be Scottish.
It' s shite being Scottish!
We' re the lowest of the low.
The scum of the fuckin 'earth!
The most wretched, miserable, servile pathetic trash that was ever shat into civilisation!
I don' t - they' re just wankers.
We, on the other hand, are colonised by wankers.
Can' t even find a decent culture to be colonised by.
We' re ruled by effete arseholes!
It' s a shite state of affairs.
All the fresh air in the world won' t make a fucking difference!
It' s no 'like...
'Around this time,
'to get back on heroin as soon as possible.
'Took about twelve hours.'
It' s not.
'Looks like a doss, a soft option.
'But living like this is a full- time business.'
The quintessential Bond girl - that' s what everyone says.
The embodiment, right, of his superiority to us.
Beautiful... exotic... highly sexual yet... totally unavailable to anyone apart from him.
Let' s face it, she' d shag one punter from Edinburgh, she' d shag the whole fucking lot of us!
I knew he was gonna do that.
She' s gone and fucking dumped me.
And that Iggy Pop business and other shite.
I said to her,
"Is there any chance of getting back together?"
No fucking way.
Honor Blackman, aka Pussy Galore.
What a total fucking misnomer!
I wouldnae touch her with yours!
I want to try it.
You' re always going on about how it' s the ultimate hit.
Better than sex.
Come on, man, I' m a fucking adult.
I can find out for myself.
I' ve got the money.
Personality.
That' s what keeps a relationship going through the years.
Like heroin.
I mean, heroin' s got great fucking personality.
'It was the source of much of our gear.
'bought them, sold them, forged or photocopied them.
'epileptics and bored housewives.
'nitrazepam, phenobarbitone,
'you can have for unhappiness and pain.
'And we took them all.
'We would' ve injected Vitamin C
May I use your bathroom?
Thank you.
Now Rent- boy, no fucking skag.
'But the good times couldn' t last forever.'
Please!
'but it hadn' t really registered before.
'She might have been screaming for a week.
'It was days since I' d heard anyone speak.
'Though surely someone must have said something
'in all that time.'
Allison?
Allison!
- Help me, please!
- Cool down!
Everything' s gonna be just fine.
'Nothing could' ve been further from the truth.
'On the contrary, everything was gonna be bad.
'Everything was gonna be even worse than it already was.'
Fuck!
'Baby Dawn - she wasn' t mine.
'I dunno.
Maybe not.
'I wished I could think of something to say -
'something human.'
Say something, Mark.
Fucking say something!
I' m cooking up.
Cook us up a shot, Rents.
I really need a hit.
'And so she did -
'I could understand that.
'To take the pain away.
'and she got a hit.
'that went without saying.
'Well, we knew who the father was now.
'It wasn' t just the baby that died that day.
'Something inside Sick Boy was lost and never returned.
Nor did I.
'Our only response was to keep going and fuck everything.
'Pile misery on misery.
'and dissolve it.
'and do it all over again.
'Keep on going out, robbing, fucking people over.
'towards the day it would all go wrong.
'Because no matter how much you stash or steal,
'No matter how often you go out and rob,
'you always need to do it all over again.
'Sooner or later,
Shoplifting is theft, which is a crime, and there is no such entity as victimless crime.
Heroin addiction explains but doesn' t excuse your actions.
Mr Murphy, you are a habitual thief, devoid of remorse.
I worry it will not be long till we meet again.
Mr Renton, you have entered a programme of rehabilitation in an attempt to wean yourself away from heroin.
The suspension of your sentence depends on your continued cooperation with this programme.
Stand guilty before me again and I won' t hesitate to impose a custodial sentence.
Thank you, Your Honour.
With God' s help, I' il conquer this terrible affliction.
'What can you say?
'Begbie had a phrase for it.'
It was obvious that cunt was gonna fuck some cunt.
Have you learnt your lesson?
I thought I was gonna lose you.
You' re nothing but trouble but I still love you!
Clean up your fucking act.
- Cut that shite out.
- Francis is talking sense.
Fucking right.
See, inside, you wouldn' t last two days.
Choose life.
My wee baby.
# Loves shortening, shortening
# Mamma' s little baby loves shortening bread!
I' m sorry, Mrs Murphy.
It wasn' t fair, Spud going down and not me.
Well, it' s no 'our fault!
Your boy went down because he was a smackhead.
If that' s not your fault then I don' t know what is.
I tried to get him off it.
I' il get the drinks in, eh?
'Wish I' d gone down, not Spud.
'and so- called mates
'Never in my puff.
'The State- sponsored addiction.
'instead of smack.
It' s never enough.
'I took all three earlier.
'18 hours to my next shot
'and the sweat on my back' s like a layer of frost.
'I need to visit the Mother Superior for one hit.
'to get us over this long, hard day.'
What' s on the menu this evening, sir?
- Your favourite dish.
- Excellent.
- Why, thank you.
Would sir care to pay for his bill in advance?
No, stick it on my tab.
Credit limit was reached and breached some time ago.
Ah, hard currency.
That' il do nicely.
Can' t be too careful when dealing with your type, sir.
- Some garlic bread?
I' il proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs.
As you wish.
Perhaps sir would like me to call for a taxi?
Wake up!
Come on, wake up!
'but it' s in the post, that' s for sure.
'I' m in the junkie limbo at the moment.
'too tired to stay awake.'
'But the sickness is on its way.
'pain and craving.
'Need like nothing else I' ve ever known
'It' s on its way.
# Ooh, you' ve got grey eyes
# Quite like you before
# Quite like you before
We' il help you, son.
You stay here till you get better.
We' il beat this together.
- No.
No clinics.
No methadone.
It made you worse.
You said so yourself.
You lied to us, son.
Your own mother and father!
You can bring some jellies...
You' re worse coming off that than you are with the heroin.
A clean break this time.
We' il keep an eye on you.
I appreciate what you' re trying to do but just bring me one more hit, plea...
You fuck!
Fuck it!
Well... this is a good fucking laugh, isn' t it?
You sweat that shite out your system.
I' il fucking kick it out.
OK?
Question number one.
The human immunodeficiency virus is a...?
Retrovirus.
Retrovirus is the right answer!
It' s a mug' s game, Mrs Renton.
I mean, I' m not saying I was blameless myself.
The time comes when you have to turn your back on that nonsense and just say no.
Just say no.
She' s dead!
Question number two.
HlV binds to which receptor on the host lymphocyte?
Which receptor is that?
CD4.
CD4 is the right answer!
Better than sex, Rents?
Better than sex?
I' m a fucking adult,
I can find out for myself.
Well, I' m finding out, all right!
Tommy!
Stop it.
Is he guilty... or not guilty?
He' s our son.
Stop looking at me!
Stop!
Mark!
There' s something you need to do.
Come alive, 35.
Box of tricks, 66.
Mark!
Mark, you' ve got a house!
House!
House!
For goodness sake, Mark.
'I really am the luckiest guy in the world.
'surrounded by the living dead.
'But not me.
'And once the pain goes,
'Depression, boredom -
'you' re so low, you want to top yourself.'
Tommy!
Tommy, it' s Mark, man.
All right, mate?
No.
Following the game at all?
Nah.
Me neither, really.
Did you take the test?
Aye.
Aye.
That' s nice.
I' m sorry, Tommy.
No.
I' m clean, man.
I' m expecting a rent cheque.
Thanks, Mark.
No bother.
'Not for me, anyway.
'when it' s some other poor cunt with shite for blood.'
- What do you want?
- Are you clean?
- Yes.
- Is that a promise?
- It is, actually!
- I' m only asking.
- No.
- I wouldn' t mind some.
- It isn' t.
- It smells like it.
- You' re too young.
- I' m too young for what?
You' re not getting any younger, Mark.
The world' s changing, music' s changing, even drugs are changing.
You can' t stay in dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.
It' s Iggy Pop.
Whatever.
The guy' s dead, anyway.
Iggy toured last year.
Tommy went to see him.
The point is, you' ve got to find something new.
I had to find something new.
'Only one thing for it.'
Lifestyle Letting Agency.
A beautifully converted Victorian townhouse.
'near to local shops.
'This one' s two bedrooms and a kitchen/ diner.
Excellent decorative order.
'Lots of storage space, all mod cons.
'And it' s going at... £320 a week.
'kept myself to myself.
'but mainly, I didn' t miss them.
'This was boom town
'where any fool could make cash from chaos.'
I' ve got a beautifully converted Victorian townhouse.
'I enjoyed the sound of it -
'sub- letting, sub- dividing.
Who' s got the keys to Talgarth Road?
'If society existed, I had nothing to do with it.
'I was almost content.'
'Glad you found a job and somewhere to live.
'School' s fine at the moment.
'I' m not pregnant - thanks for asking.
'Sick Boy wanted me to work for him.
'I told him where to go.
He sends his regards.
'I think that' s what he said.'
'No- one has seen Tommy for ages.
'because of an armed robbery in a jeweller' s.
'Take care.
'Francis Begbie...'
Armed robbery?
How could it be armed robbery with a fucking replica?
And the gear.
Look.
Supposed to be solid silver - it' s fucking garbage!
There' s young couples invest all their hopes in that stuff.
- Fucking right.
Another one of the wee Pot Noodles?
I' m fucking Lee Marvin!
Hey, Rents.
'Begbie settled in in no time at all.'
I' ve no fucking cigarettes.
Aye, right.
It' s me.
Rents!
'But it' s true -
'he' s a mate an' all so what can you do? '
Nip down the bookies and put a line on for us.
Can you no 'go yourself?
Seeing as I' m a fugitive from the law and I cannae walk the fucking streets, you go.
Here.
Four forty.
Five pound to win - Bad Boy.
Bring some fucking beer an 'all.
Come on, Bad Boy.
Come on, son.
Bad Boy!
'Came in at 16 to one.
'And with the winnings,
'Diane was right -
'Music is changing,
'drugs are changing.
Men and women are changing.
'One thousand years from now,
'there' il be no guys or girls, just wankers.
'Sounds great to me.
'It' s just a pity no- one told Begbie.'
Fuck!
'We' re heterosexual by default, not by decision.
'It' s just a question of who you fancy.
'It' s all about aesthetics and fuck all to do with morality.'
Fuck!
'But you try telling Begbie that.'
I' m not a fucking buftie!
It could have been wonderful.
Fucking listen to me, piece of junkie shit!
You mention that again and I' il cut you up.
You understand?
'Since I last saw him,
'Sick Boy had reinvented himself
'Setting up contacts
Good chips.
I can' t believe you did that.
I got a good price for it.
- I need the money.
- It was my fucking telly!
I wouldn' t have bothered.
Fucking rented, anyway.
You gonna eat that?
Have you got a passport?
Why?
Runs a hotel...
Brothel.
Loads of contacts.
Does a nice side- line in punting British passports to foreigners.
Get you a good price.
And why would I want to sell my passport?
It was just an idea.
'I had to get rid of them.
'Sick Boy didn' t do his drug deal and didn' t get rich.
'He and Begbie hung around my bedsit looking to steal things.
'I decided to put them in the worst place in the world.'
'But of course, they weren' t paying any rent.
'So when my boss found two suckers who would,
'Sick Boy and Begbie were bound to feel threatened.'
All mod cons.
'And that was that.
'But we had another reason to go back.
Tommy. '
Tommy knew he had the virus but not that he' d gone full- blown.
Was it pneumonia or cancer?
No - toxoplasmosis.
How' s that?
He wanted to see Lizzy again.
She wouldn' t let him near the house.
This kitten.
Bet Lizzy told him where to fuckin 'stick it.
"I don' t want a cat," she says.
So there' s Tommy stuck with this kitten.
You can imagine what happened.
To those gathered here today,
Thomas McKenzie filled a number of roles in our lives...
The thing was neglected.
Pissing and shitting all over.
Tommy' s lying about fucked out of his eyeballs on smack or downers.
He never knew you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit.
He had a great lust for life.
Neither did I. What is it?
Fucking horrible.
It' s like an abscess on your brain.
Fucking hell.
Then what happened?
So he uses more smack, you know, for the pain, like.
A fucking stroke!
Gets home from the hospital and dies three weeks later.
He' d been dead for ages before neighbours complained about the smell and got the police to break down the door.
The kitten was fine.
All please rise for the committal.
# Did you think I would leave you crying
# When there' s room on my horse for two?
# Don' t be dying
# I can go just as fast with two
# We' il both be soldiers
# And our horses will not be toys
# When we were two little boys
Did you tell him yet?
- On you go.
- What?
Swanney' s mate...
You know him - Mikey Forrester.
Aye.
He' s come into some gear.
- A lot of gear.
- How much gear?
About two kilos.
So he tells me.
Met two Russian sailors.
For sale there and then, like.
He wakes up next morning, realises what he' s done, gets very nervous.
He wants rid of this.
So?
So, he met me.
I offered to take it at a reasonable price so I could punt it on to a guy in London.
We' re just back from Tommy' s funeral and you' re discussing a skag deal?
Aye.
- Four grand.
- You haven' t got four grand.
We' re 2, 000 short.
Well, that' s tough.
Mark, every cunt knows you' ve been saving up down in London.
I don' t have two grand.
You fucking do.
I' ve seen your bank statement.
For fuck' s sake!
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pound.
Two kilos.
What' s that, ten years?
Mikey Forrester, Russian sailors - what the fuck are you on?
Spud, you' ve been to jail.
You want to go back?
I just want the money.
Keep your mouths shut and no cunt goes to jail.
'about what might happen in London.
'Things I didn' t want to talk to anyone about.
'Ideas best kept to myself.
'What no- one told me was that when we bought the skag,
'Begbie didn' t trust Spud
'and Sick Boy was too careful these days.
'So I rolled up my sleeve,
'I spiked my vein
It' s good.
Oh, it' s really fucking good!
'That hit was good.
'I promised myself another before I got to London.
'Just one, for old time' s sake.
'This was his nightmare.
'The dodgiest scam in a life of dodgy scams.
'Being perpetrated with three of the most useless
'and unreliable fuck- ups in town.
'I knew what was going on in his mind -
'any trouble in London and he would dump us.
'on top of that armed robbery, he' d go down for 15 to 20.
'that he didn' t shite it off 20 years in Saughton.
'This was to be my final hit.
'there' s final hits and final hits.
'What kind was this to be?'
What?
- I told you to mind the cards.
- I' ve not brought them.
I' m sorry.
- Bit fucking late, like.
- Why didn' t you bring them?
I told you to, doss cunt!
Christ!
These your friends, right?
These are the guys I told you about.
- Yeah, he' s here.
You didn' t get followed or nothing?
Didn' t get followed.
OK.
- Hi.
'Straight away,
'he saw what we were.
'Small- time wasters with an accidental big deal.'
Excuse me, gentlemen.
So... how much would you like for this?
20, 000.
I don' t think it' s worth much more than 15.
'He didn' t need to negotiate.
'What would we do if he didn' t buy it?
'Sell it on the streets?
Fuck that. '
Well, 19.
I' m terribly sorry.
I can' t go to 19.
Well, fucking 16 then.
OK.
Well, fucking 16 it is, then.
These, gentlemen, are £2, 000 bundles.
That' s four...
'We settled on £16, 000.
'He' d a lot more in his suitcase
'but it was better than nothing.'
Thank you, gentlemen.
May I say it' s been a pleasure haggling with you.
Fucking brand new.
'For a moment,
'it felt great.
'like it meant something.
'A moment like that can touch you
'but it doesn' t last long.
Not like £16, 000. '
Spud, any investments planned?
Gonna buy an island in the sun?
For 4, 000?
One palm tree and a sewage outflow!
I don' t know, man.
I' m gonna get something for my ma.
And some good speed.
No bicarb.
Get a girl, take her out, treat her right...
And shag her?
True love.
But I could handle hot sex with a Jewish princess tonight!
Ya daft cunt!
- Or a Catholic.
- Don' t waste it.
Get the drinks.
I got a round already.
I got the last one.
Your round, Franco.
Same again?
- I' m off for a piss.
See when I get back, that money' s still here, OK?
No, we' re out the door.
I' il be after you.
You' il never catch us, flabby.
But when I get back...
Be halfway down the street with the money.
- I' d fucking kill you.
- I thought you might.
Thought you might.
Are you game for it?
What?
Well?
Are you serious?
Don' t know.
What d' you think?
- Oh, aye.
- Wouldn' t run out on a mate.
- I would.
Where' s Franco?
For fuck' s sake!
Sorry.
I' il buy you another.
You ruined my fucking suit, you fucking idiot!
I' m sorry.
"Sorry" won' t dry me off, you cunt.
He says he' s sorry.
Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.
You can' t even hold a pint.
No, Franco, no...
For fuck' s sake!
Fucking nice one, Franco (!)
- You cut me, man!
- You were in my way.
You?
We' d better go.
To hospital.
You' re not going to hospital.
Stay there.
You bring me down a fucking cigarette.
And the bag.
'in all sorts of ways.
'It wasn' t a big deal -
'just a minor betrayal.
'that sort of thing.
'But let' s face it, I ripped them off -
'my so- called mates.
'But Begbie, I couldn' t give a shit about him.
'if he' d only thought of it first.
'And Spud...
Well, OK, I felt sorry for Spud.
'He never hurt anybody.
Bastard!
Open up.
Open up now!
'So why did I do it?
'I could offer a million answers, all false.
'The truth is that I' m a bad person.
'But that' s gonna change.
'I' m going to change.
This is the last of that.
'Now I' m cleaning up, going straight and choosing life.
'I' m looking forward to it.
'I' m gonna be just like you -
'Good health, low cholesterol,
Notice the elegance of the proof.
It' s beautiful!
It reminds me of a quote from Socrates:
"If measure and symmetry are absent from any composition, -
- the ruin awaits both the ingredients and the composition. "
"Measure and symmetry are beauty and virtue the world over."
- Do you think he' s straight?
- Yeah, he' s too boring to be gay.
- Yes, it is.
Thank you...
I have... an appointment.
You are all welcome.
Thank you.
Rose, get that mask off your face.
It' il clog your pores.
It' s almost seven o' clock.
You bum!
For what?
Come on.
Just one more out.
- Barry Neufeld.
- Hi, it' s Rose.
Hi...
Not again.
I think it' s an allergic reaction to something I ate.
- My throat' s starting to close up.
- It sounds like you' re dying.
- Sure you' re not allergic to me?
- That' s a terrible thing to think!
Every Manhattan restaurant hates me for not keeping reservations.
Why don' t you call me next week?
If you still want to.
- Feel better.
- Thank you.
Bye.
- Should I start with a joke?
- No, there' s not enough time.
- For what?
- To develop a sense of humour.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, the author of "Absolute Truth", -
- Columbia' s very own Professor Gregory Larkin.
You' re going to be fine.
Thank you.
I' m honoured by this warm and gracious welcome.
Being here, at the end of a journey, I' m reminded of Descartes' words:
"Whether I am awake or asleep, two and three will always make five."
"It does not seem possible that such a truth can be questioned."
This book has taken me over 14 years to write.
It is with sadness I say goodbye to it consuming my days and nights.
And nights...
And as I stand here...
In coming up... summing up...
Excuse me, I' m feeling a little dizzy.
I thought it would feel differently.
I thought I' d know more.
I don' t.
I don' t know anything, really.
Thank you all for coming.
What did I say?
It was fine, though you shouldn' t work for a suicide hotline.
- You did fine until Candice came.
- Don' t start.
I just forgot to eat.
It' s natural.
She left you what, a year ago?
Thank God Candy left when she did, or I' d never have finished the book.
You' re a guy who can' t have sex and chew gum at the same time.
When I' m with someone, I tend to get a little sidetracked.
- 14 years?
Is that sidetracked?
- I bet she' s still out there.
If I know Candice, she' s out there.
She' s out there.
Face her like a grown- up.
- Don' t let me go home with her.
- It would be odd not to invite...
Just don' t let me go home with her.
Are you all right?
- It was the stupid wine.
Hello.
- You look great.
I hope you don' t mind me showing up like this on your big night.
It' s just that I' ve been thinking so much about you lately.
- Do you want to go get a drink?
- I' d better not.
- A bite to eat?
- No, I' m not hungry.
- Do you want me to take you home?
- Okay.
- Good to see you, Henry.
- But Greg...
- Don' t leave.
- Well, we' re done.
- I still have feelings for you.
- But I dumped you for another man.
- And I' m still sort of with Paul.
- I thought that was over.
I wanted to feel better about myself before I see him.
- Well, yeah.
But let' s face it, -
- we' ve nothing in common except sex, and the fact you idolize me.
I really do care for you.
- I just can' t wind up with you.
- Can I call you sometime?
What for?
- Are you going?
- No, I cancelled.
What do you want to do for dinner?
Make that pasta with artichokes.
Later we can figure out what to do with your hair for Claire' s wedding.
What is this?
Look at that.
The mating ritual is both speedy and violent.
The lesser male often covers the larger female.
If unsuccessful in mounting, the male is often eaten by the female.
We' re the girls of 1- 400 Hot Talk.
Briana, Tina, Marla and me:
Felicia.
Anything you want to talk about, call me...
- I don' t know where to begin.
- Are you lonely tonight, darling?
- So am I. What are you wearing?
- Nothing special.
- Can I ask you a question?
- I' m just wearing a towel.
I was drying myself off, after a hot shower...
Why do women leave?
Especially pretty ones.
I can' t do it any more.
There are no guarantees.
The mathematical world is completely rational.
You think too much.
Don' t you want to know how big my tits are?
No!
I just want to share my life with someone.
Someone I' m not sexually attracted to.
How can two people come together in lasting respect and affection?
- The world' s run by sex ads.
- Take out your own ad, I guess.
An ad?
I' m a grown woman wearing a prom dress.
I look like an over- the- hill Barbie doll.
And it' s too tight.
- I want something in my colour.
- Maids of honour don' t wear black.
- Why aren' t you wearing make- up?
- I am wearing make- up.
- You' d look good with a perm.
- Like Shirley Temple on crack.
Where is she?
She can' t stand that I' m getting all the attention.
- We should' ve had her committed.
- For excessive vanity?
Two compassionate daughters.
No make- up today?
I am wearing make- up.
- What the hell are you wearing?
- It' s an imitation Scassi.
- You' re my mother, not the singer.
- I' il go home and change.
We' re late.
The priest is sweating.
All celibates sweat, dear.
If they didn' t, they' d explode.
If I sit through this without eating, I' il pass out.
It' il only take 45 minutes.
Marrying outside your faith, and on the sabbath...
All I know about the sabbath is that Bergdorff' s isn' t too crowded.
I want you to remember, today is my day.
Behave, or I' il blow up your birth certificate into a Christmas card.
I should have never encouraged you to speak.
Maybe she' il look back and turn into a pillar of salt.
Alex looks nervous.
- I hope I' m doing the right thing.
- I think you are.
The party is about to get started.
The dance floor is all yours!
Okay girls, lick your lips.
Tell Claire I' m looking for her.
Your husband' s a lucky guy.
- Waiter!
Can we have more dressing?
- We were separated at birth.
- Two more drinks, when you can.
- This looks delicious.
- I can' t believe he' s married.
- And that he chose Claire over you.
- I told you not to introduce them.
- She was married, I didn' t think.
- How are you handling all this?
- No more fantasies of handsome men.
- There' s a guy out there somewhere.
Barry Neufeldt?
What' s wrong with him, other than that he looks like Gumpy?
Gumby, not Gumpy.
- I' m no great prize, either.
- You' re a great person and teacher.
I think I' ve reached the point where you know you' il never get married.
What' s marriage?
Fighting, compromising.
It can be more than that.
You know what I envy about people in love?
I' d love it if someone really knew me.
What I' m afraid of.
What kind of toothpaste I use.
I think that would really be wonderful.
Hey, sister- in- law, having a good time?
- Have you seen Claire?
- No, I' il find her for you.
You look beautiful tonight.
You really do.
I heard you.
Why don' t you have some coffee?
I' il find Claire.
- Alex is looking for you.
- Brother, it' s starting already?
How could you do this?
I' il never forgive you.
- I' m Professor Gregory Larkin.
I' m calling about the response to my ad.
Is this Professor Morgan?
- I' m her sister.
She knows nothing.
- Then maybe we shouldn' t talk.
No!
Most of these guys are creeps.
But when it said you taught at Columbia, something just clicked.
- You have seen her picture, right?
- Yes.
- And...?
- And what?
Nothing.
Great.
Make way, please.
This is the scene at my sister' s wedding.
She' s getting drunk, regretting that she got married for the third time.
My mom' s sprouting snakes from her hair in jealousy.
It was perfect...
We' ve got three feminine archetypes:
The divine whore, Medusa - and me.
What archetype am I?
- The Virgin Mary?
- Thanks a lot, Trevor.
No, the faithful handmaiden.
Always the bridesmaid, never the bride.
It proves what Jung said all along.
Myths and archetypes are alive and well and living in my apartment.
As I stood beside the altar beside my sister and her husband to be, -
- it struck me that this ritual, a wedding ceremony, -
- is the last scene of a fairy tale.
They never say what happens after.
That Cinderella drove the prince mad by obsessively cleaning the castle.
They don' t say what happens after because there is no after.
The be- all and end- all of romantic love was...
Mike?
- Sex?
- You have sex on the brain.
- Marriage.
- But it wasn' t always like that.
The 12th century had "courtly love", which had nothing to do with sex.
The relationship between a knight and a married lady of the court...
And so they could never consummate their love.
They rose above "going to the toilet in front of each other" love, -
- and went after something more divine.
They took sex out of the equation, leaving them with a union of souls.
Think of this.
Sex was always the fatal love potion.
Look at the literature of the time.
All consummation could lead to was madness, despair or death.
Experts, scholars and my Aunt Esther are united in one belief:
True love has spiritual dimensions, while romantic love is a lie.
A myth.
A soulless manipulation.
And speaking of manipulation...
It' s like going to the movies and seeing the lovers kiss...
The music swells, and we buy it, right?
So when my date kisses me, and I don' t hear strings, I dump him.
The question is, why do we buy it?
Because, myth or manipulation, we all want to fall in love.
That experience makes us feel completely alive.
Our everyday reality is shattered, and we are flung into the heavens.
It may only last a moment, an hour, but that doesn' t diminish its value.
We' re left with memories we treasure for the rest of our lives.
I read, "When we fall in love, we hear Puccini in our heads."
His music expresses our need for passion and romantic love.
- or watch Casablanca, and a little of that love lives in us too.
So the final question is:
Why do people want to fall in love -
- when it can have such a short run and be so painful?
- Propagation of the species?
- We need to connect with somebody.
- Are we culturally preconditioned?
- Good, but too intellectual for me.
I think it' s because, as some of you may already know...
While it does last, it feels fucking great.
I' m almost finished, and you haven' t started yet.
The perfect bite.
You need a therapist.
Do we have to have the TV on?
Can' t we have a conversation?
I' m not intellectually stimulating, like your university people...
I' m sorry.
How was your day, Mother?
- Who gives a shit?
- I said I was sorry.
Let' s talk.
I' ve lived too long.
I should be dead.
Talk to me already!
All right.
You haven' t even noticed I had my hair done differently.
I thought you looked different.
It looks great.
- The...
Nothing.
You' re just like your father.
So easy to trip up.
- So, how was work?
- Same as always.
Though I had one customer in for a make- over.
She needed one.
Ash- brown foundation.
Hideous.
- She was shocked over my age.
- How old were you?
Sorry.
I ran into Mr. Jenkins again.
He cornered me in the elevator.
He invited me to an Alzheimer' s benefit.
I said forget it.
I can' t believe he still asks you.
Why don' t you go with him sometime?
No...
I buried a husband.
That' s my life.
I don' t want to start another.
And he knows my situation with you.
You won' t see him because of me?
The mother' s dating and the daughter stays home?
Who' s looking?
Hello...
Hi.
Hello, this is...
Hello, I' m Gregory Larkin.
Professor Gregory Larkin.
Answer the phone.
I' m sleeping.
Is Professor Larkin there?
I mean, is Professor Morgan there?
- Barely.
Who' s this?
- Gregory Larkin.
I' m a professor in the math department at Columbia.
I was just calling to see...
- How are you tonight?
- I' m fine.
How are you?
Fine.
I hope it wasn' t presumptuous of me, but I went to your class -
- and was very impressed.
I hoped we could eat dinner Saturday.
- I sat in on your class.
Don' t go away.
- I was impressed by your teaching.
I was hoping we could have dinner Saturday.
I can do this!
Can you hear me?
You want to eat dinner.
- I sat in on your class.
- Who' s on the phone?
- Quiet!
No, not you.
Gregory Larkin.
Columbia.
- I saw you pass by.
- I was just passing by...
- I' m sorry about calling...
- I was so confused.
- Are we on for Saturday night?
- Sure.
- I' m looking forward to it.
- Moi aussi.
He must be good- looking, for you to go to all this trouble.
- I hate lipstick.
- Did you try the samples I brought?
- I' m not going.
- Oh, what do you want for dinner?
I don' t care.
I' m upset.
Can' t you see that?
- You always cancel your dates.
- This is not a date.
Then why does it matter how you look with this one?
Stop calling him "this one".
And nothing' s going to happen.
You need more colour.
Let me do it.
- Don' t make me look like a clown.
- You won' t look like a clown.
- Where' s the hairpiece?
- Shall I make you something to eat?
He mustn' t think he' s the only date you' ve had in years.
Where' s the bow?
Hey, your mother did you up again.
Looks great!
Can I get you a cab?
Sorry.
Are you sure?
You' re going to take me?
Here' s where I' m going, but don' t go until I put up the window.
- They' re broke, lady.
- My hair!
Complain to the cab company.
- For what?
You' re exactly on time.
My hair.
I must look like I was attacked by wolves.
I didn' t even notice.
Could you excuse me while I go to the ladies' room for a minute?
Do you enjoy dancing?
I used to love to dance with my father.
You?
I find it embarrassing.
I enjoy watching it.
- Watching?
- Pairs...
It' s interesting how coupling appears in nature and mathematics.
- You were talking about pairs...
- Oh, the twin- prime conjecture.
Those only divisible by themselves.
Not seven- nine...
- Nine can be divided by three.
- That' s right.
11- 13 and 17- 19 and so on.
It was discovered that pairs were often separated by...
- One number in between.
- Exactly.
Did you read my book?
- No, I' m sorry.
This is marvellous.
- A first date like a game show.
- I didn' t mean to lecture.
I' m sorry, I didn' t mean to call it a date.
It' s just rare that I meet a person I can discuss these things with.
- Some pepper?
- No, not for me.
Could you bring me a side dish of extra dressing?
I don' t particularly like salad, I just like the dressing.
Interesting theory.
Are there still pairs like that past a million?
I can' t believe you thought of that.
That is what is to be proven.
Can we do this again?
- Great.
Terrific.
What was it you wanted to discuss about my teaching?
That was just an excuse to meet you.
I hope you don' t mind.
I have many questions, the first of which is:
How do you get them to stay?
Well?
- Nothing.
- What happened to your hair?
Don' t ask.
- You won' t be seeing him again?
- We' re going out next week.
So, he must like you.
Did he kiss you?
No.
That' s kind of sweet, actually.
Hi.
This is Cindy.
This is a spectrum analyzer.
It makes graphic representations of the music.
Watch.
- Who' s the girl?
- Rose Morgan.
Henry Fine is a professor in anthropology.
Beautiful music, isn' t it?
Beautiful atmosphere.
I enjoyed that.
Thank you so much for inviting me.
I' d like to give you a copy of my book.
Your book, I mean.
Not to come up to your apartment.
But Rose, I' m inviting you.
If you like this kind of music, I have some wonderful CD' s, but...... they' re also in my apartment.
I' m a bit out of practice with this.
I want you to feel comfortable.
That' s important to me.
I want to tell you upfront.
I' m not interested in sex.
- You' re not?
- And it has nothing to do with you.
It has to do with what you were talking about in your class.
I, too, believe it' s illusions about love and the emphasis on sex -
- that separate people today.
As you said, romance is a myth.
I was referring to academic opinions that are purely subjective.
You were right!
Relationships based on romantic love are worthless.
Did you stay for my whole class?
I left when you mentioned the music we hear when lovers kiss in films.
It is manipulative!
In real life, we don' t hear music when we kiss.
And the person you' re with isn' t a movie star.
It' s a malicious...
Fantasy?
Is it all right if I sit down for a minute?
The addiction to beauty and perfection created by advertising -
- feeds on people' s pathetic hopes.
They don' t have their own opinions.
The media tells us what' s beautiful.
TV shows tell us what a relationship is supposed to be like.
And sex!
I don' t even want to tell you how that' s ruined my life...
Well, I go crazy.
When I want someone sexually, I go out of my mind.
Do you remember that film where the woman kills the bunny?
- "Fatal Attraction"?
- Granted, it was a film.
But I understand how she felt.
Not that I would kill an animal, -
- but I know the feeling of wanting someone so much that it hurts.
This fiction, known as love, drives people crazy, as you said.
- Then you' re either mad, alone...
- Or dead.
But that was fiction.
We' re dead!
I do believe two people can come together, even marry, -
- for reasons more concrete than sex.
A love that grows out of respect, love, trust, common interest.
Have you noticed that friendships last longer than marriages?
The 12th century was on to something.
Would you like coffee?
- Yeah.
Are you busy this week?
I was hoping you could help me with my teaching.
You give yourself too little credit.
Maybe you could sit in on one of my classes.
If X squared plus Y squared equals 16, -
- how do we find D YlD X as an implicit function of X and Y?
Well, Y is a function of X...
You walk across the room like this, and you' re into your own thing.
Your body language is very detached, very alienating.
I think you have to relate more to the kids.
You' re up there with your back to the room, solving your own problems.
It' s like you' re having a math party, and only invited yourself.
Loosen up.
Have some fun.
Have fun...
What else?
Loosen up.
Put the pen down, I' m not going to test you on this.
Teach me something.
If a ball is thrown up into the air, and its height, H, equals 100 T...
What are you doing?
Turn around.
Talk to me.
If T is time in seconds, at what limit is the speed...
You lost me.
You have to put it in context.
- Jazz it up, put some humour in it.
- Humour in calculus?
- Well, try telling a story.
- A story?
Once upon a time...... there was a ball.
It was thrown into the air.
And its height...
Maybe I should just write books.
Just kidding.
- Don' t give up.
Try it again.
- Tell you another story?
Hi, Professor Larkin...
Sorry.
That' s all right.
- Do we have an appointment?
- Actually, I wanted to make one.
Could you come back tomorrow?
- My head is swimming.
It' s hot.
- Put your head between your legs.
Pretty girl.
With all that make- up?
You don' t wear any, do you?
I' d still look like me, only in colour.
You' re too smart for that.
You' re a confident, no- nonsense woman.
- I sound like an airline.
- I' m probably saying it wrong.
It' s just that you don' t need any of that.
Thanks.
How' s your head?
- I think food will help you.
- Pizza, maybe?
Where can we go?
Dancing?
Why did I say that?
There' s that great dessert place.
All delicious things are fattening.
My mother would kill me.
What is that, Danish?
This is the one.
Trees are fascinating.
They don' t have to touch to propagate.
You would find that fascinating...
- How many do I need?
- One, two, three, four...
Why didn' t I see that?
I owe you one.
- It' s right in front of your eyes.
Six and a five.
I got you.
The pretzel!
You can have mine.
You sounded excited on the phone.
I' m going to take my theory of love as a man- made cultural creation -
- and expand it to include the biological effect on the individual.
You need a hobby.
I can' t believe you' ve dated for three months and haven' t kissed!
I can' t believe you' ve dated for three months and haven' t kissed!
- How do you say hello?
- Well, we nod.
It works.
- You mean you haven' t even touched?
- I fell once, and he picked me up.
That' s what we do.
And I don' t worry about what I say, what I wear, what I eat...
It' s a relief to eat with a man, and not worry that he' il be frightened.
He' s fun to be with.
Maybe "fun" isn' t the word.
He' s interesting.
How many men can you say that about?
Is a tie too personal a gift?
Are you using it on something other than his neck?
Does he look good in vests?
Why do you want him to meet your mother?
I kept saying I was a great cook, so I offered him a birthday dinner.
Now I need something nice.
After meeting her, I won' t see him again.
Can we eat?
- I can' t, I have a date.
- Find a gift for Dr. Strangelove.
- Who?
We should get you some blush.
- I' m hungry, Claire.
- Fruit.
Why are you so grumpy?
If he wasn' t gorgeous, rich and straight, I wouldn' t have bothered.
I' m sick to death of the man I am bound to for eternity.
Why are you saying that?
No matter where I go, what I do, there he is.
In the kitchen, on the phone, on my finger.
When I wake up, he' s staring at me.
- I think that' s sweet.
- I think it' s strange.
Do you know how weird that makes me feel?
A lesbian dream, and he' s staring at me like I should include him.
I can' t even fantasize in private.
Mom said you' ve been seeing someone steady.
Is he cute?
- What?
- What are you doing here?
I thought I' d meet you for coffee.
Is that a terrible thing to do?
I' m going to the ladies' room.
Alone.
Can you believe this weather?
It' s almost April and it' s still cold.
I' m glad I have you alone.
Can I ask you a question?
Lt' il sound strange, but...
Is Claire happy?
I mean, do you think she' s happy?
Yes, I think she is.
Why?
I' m a first- time husband.
If she doesn' t wake up and tell me she' s ecstatic, I worry.
Imagine, I have you to thank for the fact that we' re married.
You made this possible.
Knowing you has changed my life.
- Don' t do that.
- What?
What am I doing?
You don' t even know, do you?
Rose...
- Just tell Claire I had to run.
- Rose, I' m sorry.
I hate this.
It' s so stupid.
I must sound so pathetic.
He asked if Claire was happy, and I lied.
- Isn' t that awful?
- Nothing criminal.
- Thanks for coming so quickly.
- Are you feeling better now?
A little.
- You know, Rose, it takes time.
- Yeah, I know.
I want you to know our friendship really means a lot to me.
I feel the same way, which is why tonight...
I better go home, I have to get dinner ready.
I' il see you at eight.
Shall I bring anything for your mother?
Yeah, a wooden stake and a crucifix.
Rose loves to fold napkins.
It' s one of her idiosyncracies.
God knows how I look.
- I hope you like it.
- My God, Rose, it' s art!
It' s not art.
It' s one who sets the table, -
- prepares a meal, or teaches in a certain way.
You' re an artist.
Why didn' t you use the Limoges?
May I serve you?
- Rose!
- My hands are clean.
We go to all this trouble, and Rose and I don' t eat very much.
I' ve always thought she had a very healthy appetite.
I can' t stand women who eat two bites and say they' re full.
Do you really need extra salt?
You know how it retains water.
- Can I have some?
And potatoes.
- You don' t need them.
Have you ever sat in on one of your daughter' s lectures?
- Rose!
- That' s the best part.
Rose tells me you' ve never been married.
That' s all right, Rose.
That' s true, Mrs. Morgan.
I guess I haven' t found the right girl.
I' ve had relationships that haven' t worked out, but that will change.
Really?
Why?
As I told Rose, I have a theory about love...
- And sex.
- Does anybody want coffee?
- What theory?
- Regular or decaf?
- Regular.
- I can make cappuccinos.
Would you like cappuccinos?
Greg, why don' t you help me.
- Why don' t you put the coffee on?
You put it on.
I' ve raised two daughters, buried a husband, I' ve made my coffee.
Alone at last.
- I' ve heard a lot about you.
- And I' ve heard a lot about you.
You' ve been seeing a lot of my daughter.
What are your intentions?
My intentions?
What a lovely meal!
You' re a good cook.
- I didn' t oversell myself?
- Not at all, but the trouble...
Of course I had to go to the trouble.
It was your birthday.
What are friends for, but to give each other presents and stuff...
Happy birthday.
Open it up!
I really hope you like it.
- Dice?
- They once were dice.
- Now they' re cuff links with...
- Prime numbers!
- They' re great!
How' d you do that?
- I had them made just for you.
- They were done very fast.
- Thank you.
Well...
I' ve wanted to ask you something, and I can only say this once...
Sit down.
Some variables will remain unknown, -
- as is the case with most complex equations...
- Greg, talk to me.
- I' m not saying this right.
This feeling you have for Alex...
It won' t be the same with me.
You won' t have that ache in your stomach, because we' re not in love.
I think we share a genuine affection for each other.
We share a passion for knowledge rather than a physical passion.
Although, if sex is something that interests you, -
- I' m sure I could provide that on occasion, given enough warning.
- What are you saying?
- We were in love and miserable.
It' s a waste, because as people, we' re valuable.
When I look at you, I see a woman unlike any other I' ve known before.
Your mind, your humour, your passion for ideas.
I' m very fond of you.
When I' m with you, I feel as if...... as if I' m home.
So I think we should get married.
Are my reasons more insane than those?
Are you in shock, or just appalled?
Blink if you can hear me.
Why are you laughing?
This sounds silly, but I was just thinking...
How could I marry someone that I' ve never even...
You know...
... kissed.
I promised your sister I wouldn' t.
You love Claire, too?
You just slept with her?
- You want to?
- I don' t even know her.
It' s about how I found you.
I wrote this ad...
I think that' s kind of great.
- I thought you' d be upset.
You picked me.
Actually, I found you through this charming woman on TV...
So?
Gregory just proposed to me.
Do you need a valium?
I know you don' t respect my opinion, but I don' t trust him.
- I mean, where' s the attraction?
- He' s not attracted to me.
He wants to be companions.
What sane person would agree to that kind of marriage?
It' s not natural.
Are Claire and Alex natural?
He wants me, Mother!
He wants you to cook and clean!
- He found you through an ad.
- I already know, Mom.
Sorry.
It' s not your average proposal, but let' s face it, -
- they' re not standing in line for me.
And we like each other!
Then say yes!
I can live alone.
If you think such a marriage is normal, then go ahead.
Why do you do that?
Why do you make it sound so pathetic?
A husband who adored you.
Can' t I have some of that?
I' m getting older, too.
Why can' t you be happy for me?
But you can' t, can you?
You' re scared to death of being alone.
And you' re jealous.
Jealous because a man wants me.
A good- looking man.
How ridiculous!
Well, you know something, Mom?
A man does.
Today, Gregory Larkin and Rose Morgan have exchanged rings -
- and agreed to recognise each other as equals.
They shall seek a life of kindness and understanding.
The ceremony of marriage is a means of establishing a home.
And as you have exchanged vows before witnesses, -
- by the authority vested in me, I pronounce you husband and wife.
- Congratulations!
She' s a great...
- Yes.
I' ve heard so much about you.
- Likewise, about you.
- We all ought to...
Had I known you were this handsome, I' d have answered the ad myself.
Congratulations.
She' s the best.
If I were a man, I' d be all over her.
Congratulations.
I' m sure you' il both be very fascinating to watch.
Rose, isn' t it amazing how many books you accumulate over the years?
- I can' t believe it.
And the dust!
- This place needs a good cleaning.
- We' il take care of that.
I made room for your books.
Need any help?
Everything' s put in its place.
- What would you like to do?
- Go to bed.
In order to sleep.
You go to the bed for sleeping.
- Do you want to do something else?
- What?
- I wasn' t going to say anything.
- Do you want the bathroom first?
- No, I can wait.
- No, you go.
Please.
Your turn.
- Not really.
Me neither.
These are nice.
- Sure.
I have some old movies.
"It Happened One Night", "Lawrence of Arabia", "Now, Voyager"?
How about "Lawrence of Arabia"?
It' s nice and long.
Okay.
"Lawrence of Arabia" it is.
Why don' t you, like, ever realize the truth, Vince?
I ate nine pies and a meatball hero in one hour.
That' s a record.
You left two slices of mushroom on the last tray.
- Violet?
No hero.
I had to call the paramedics to pump your stomach, and it was three and a half years ago.
When are you guys gonna talk about something else?
When someone comes through that door and breaks the record, then we' il stop talkin 'about the subject.
Enjoy your pie, guys.
- It' s the last one I' il ever serve.
- Aren' tyou forgetting something?
I' m not doin 'that.
It' s a tradition.
Sign the card.
I got it, folks.
I got the first autograph.
- Violet' s on her way to the wall.
That' s 20 years of girls leaving town.
That wall is jinxed.
I won' t sit near that wall.
Let' s hope you have better luck than they did.
- Ladies and gentlemen.
As you all know, my best friend, Violet Sanford, has decided -- has decided to leave South Amboy tomorrow... and travel the 42 miles to New York City.
Bring her up here, girls.
Come on, Vi.
Come up here.
Now, I think it' s only fair that tonight, on her last night with us in Jersey, she grace us with a little tune.
No way!
Look at this!
No reason at all.
[Clicks Tongue]
- Tragic.
- Dad, what' re you doin?
I guess four out of seven million ain' t so bad.
Dad, stop.
I get the point.
Eat your eggs.
They' re not eggs.
And I' d rather eat the carton.
You' ve already lost six pounds.
No sausage.
Oh, and I bought you some oft hose Lean Cuisine meals, and I put 'em in the freezer.
- My mouth is watering already.
- And I lined your vitamins up on the counter.
- I don' t take vitamins.
- You do now. Just take them.
Excuse me.
I' m the parent.
You' re the child running away to live by herself.
Fine.
- Simple.
Don' t go.
Oh.
And Dad, whatever you do --
Don' t do the laundry.
Ah, this is interesting.
They say the handrails on the subway system could one day lead to an outbreak of plague.
Dad.
You said I could be whatever I wanna be.
That' s the exception.
You said anything, and I believed you, so -- [Sighs]
I' m not leavin 'this house without your support.
What' s it gonna be?
Violet, I saw how hard it was for your mother when she didn' t make it.
But if she was here, she' d tel lme to shut up, wish you luck and give you a big hug.
I' m not gonna give you a big hug, and I' m not gonna wish you luck, but...
Is that okay?
This is the last ofit.
- Yeah, I got it.
I got it.
That' s everything.
- Let' s hit it.
There, I said it.
- Love you.
Even if you' re not sure.
Just start spraying.
You know, you' re not alone, Mr. Sanford.
Hey, you know, me and you should have dinner sometime.
I' m lockin 'the doors.
This is it.
What do you think?
I had a feeling you were gonna need this.
- What?
It' s just some emergency cash I saved up.
Honey, from the looks oft his place, I' d say this is our emergency.
Well, I' m not takin 'it.
Fine, then.
I' m freezing your assets.
So, thanks for everything.
- [Sniffling]
What is this?
It' s just that all our lives, you know, we always had one thing in common, you and me.
What are you talking about?
It' s like, you know we said we wouldn' t lose our virginity... until we got married, and that didn' t happen.
And then we said we' d go to college or junior college... or dental hygienist school, you know.
And that didn' t happen.
We' ve never followed through on a single thing, you know.
[Chuckles]
And this is why you' re crying?
Well... a long time ago you told me that you were gonna move to New York.
You know.
And -- And look at you.
No matter what, you really did it right, and I' m so proud ofyou.
You hear me?
You be quiet! Enough in there!
I' m Violet Sanford.
I just recently moved to New York, and I was wondering ifyou would give my tape to one of your artists.
Violet, that is so cute.
Now, let me tell you about me.
My name is Wendy, and I first moved to New York... when I was 21 to be a dancer, but I broke my big toe.
And then I got knocked up by this actor who dumped me to join the Peace Corps.
So for the last 16 years I been raisin 'my daughter all by myself.
And then two weeks ago she tells me that she is a bisexual... and that she hates me more than any person on this planet.
Now, tell me how I can help you, please, because I am dying to make your dreams come true.
You don' t take the tape unless it comes from an agent, but I can' t get an agent until I get published?
If we were to listen to that tape, that would give you grounds... for a copyright or plagiarism lawsuit.
All I want is someone to sing my songs.
Welcome to the music business.
- Good evening.
Uh, sure.
- Let me ask you something.
I' m a songwriter.
Is there someone here I could talk to about my songs?
I' ve been a struggling sax player for 12 years.
- What can I get you from the bar?
- Pepsi and some crackers.
Excuse me.
Who' s that guy?
That would be Mr. O' Donnell.
He' s the manager or something?
He' s the music manager.
He' s in charge of finding bands and... booking new talent.
Hey, where the hell were you, O' Donnell?
I got 15 orders stacked up here and nobody to run the grill.
Is that all?
Gimme ten minutes, I' il catch us up.
Relax.
We can talk about my raise later.
There' s no raise.
I' m about to fire you.
- Yes.
I' m a songwriter.
I just wanted to give this to you.
- But this is all pretty new to me.
- It' s pretty new to me too.
I just figured as the manager of a club like this, you must know every band on the East Coast.
The manager... of this club.
I' il catch up.
- Sure thing.
Mr. O' Donnell.
Um, but I -- I have a feeling aboutyou.
- So I' m gonna take your tape, and I' m gonna see what I can do.
- Thank you.
I can' t believe how easy this was.
Neither can I.
Uh, you wanna go for some coffee or something?
Your goddamn maid?
That' s Mr. O' Donnell, but I' il let it slide this time.
I told you to take your stuff home and wash it.
You got cow grease caked on the front.
Walt, I' ve warned you about your attitude -- You' re fired.
Oh, you better not push me, kid.
I can find a hundred other little punks like you, can burn a turkey burger.
Minimum wage punk.
Uh...
I' m Kevin O' Donnell, and I work the grill here at the Fiji Mermaid Club.
I just made a complete fool of myself.
I was gonna tell you.
I' m almost sure I would have told you.
I just want you to know I' m not following you home.
I' m just walking myself 26 blocks in the wrong direction.
- I asked you to leave me alone.
You did throw yourself at me.
I didn' t throw myself at you.
I was pretending to be sweet and innocent so you' d give me a break.
- What?
Is there a reason we just walked in a circle?
Are you lost?
I' m not lost.
Somebody just moved my street.
You -- You wanna play a game?
I bet I can guess where you' re from.
I' m about to get out my pepper spray.
I reckon you' re from a big city.
And there' s no sign from here of a belly button ring... or a tongue piercing.
- I gotta go with Chicago.
I' ve never had anyone stare at my ass for half an hour, so I' m gonna say good night.
And I' m hoping you' re gonna say it back.
Okay.
I can take a hint.
I really do know a lot of people in the music business.
You just don' t give up, do ya?
It did me in.
- Good night, Kevin.
Just for the record, I was only staring at your ass for the first 15 minutes.
William Morris.
- I don' t mean to interrupt.
- I just want to leave this -- - I' il transfer.
- It' s a demo.
I' m a songwriter.
[Phones Disconnect]
I just want to leave this for Whitney and Mariah.
- I' m sure they' re personal friends of yours.
I' m sure it sounds great in your shower, but karaoke ended a half hour ago.
So if you' d like to get your songs heard, you' re gonna have to take them... to an open mic night just like everyone else.
William Morris.
I' il transfer.
You' re not getting validated.
- Um --
Yeah, hi.
Uh, I' m sure all your spaces are filled for tonight.
I just wanted to come down and check out what this whole open mic thing was about.
A couple of my regulars, they called in sick.
So, uh, I' ve got some spaces to fill.
I need you to sign your name in here and get yourself ready.
Bathroom' s around the corner if you want to throw up.
Next up we have a young lady named Violet Sanford.
So let' s put our hands together for NewJersey' s own Violet Sanford!
Good!
- I' m a little nervous.
- So are we, honey.
Don' t tease me, honey!
Sing!
Come on, give her a break.
I' m sorry.
You gotta cheer up.
You look like somebody ran over your dog.
Hey, um, how much is a slice of pie?
Oh, uh, we happen to have the best French apple in town.
And, uh, it' s on the house.
- Twenty says it' s Pretty Woman.
- Oh?
- You guys have to read the signs.
- What?
- Let' s flip this over, and Miss Jennifer from Austin... says her favorite movie is --
You already saw this one.
Oh, you are such a cheater.
Easy play to call.
- Thank you.
- Those boots are kinda cute.
- [Chuckles]
That is the jam.
There you go, there you go.
- Remember this?
- [Girls Groaning]
- Belly dancing.
- Oh, yeah.
- Wait, wait.
- They have to, in their line of work.
- Are they hookers?
Coyotes.
You guys wanna see what Al gave me for my birthday?
- You let him brand you?
- Isn' t it cute?
- She let the man brand her.
Hey, check it out, ladies.
- Mmm.
Hmm?
- Yeah.
To Zoe' s last week as a Coyote.
- She' s gonna be impossible to replace.
I just wanna tell you both that I will never, ever forget you.
Who' s up there?
- I' m lookin 'for the owner.
Bring a case with you.
What are you doin 'here?
Where doyou want me to put it?
What do ya want?
Well, I heard you might need a new, uh --
That, uh, there might be a job opening.
Put it right there.
Let me take a look atya.
Let me guess.
Piedmont, North Dakota.
South Amboy, New Jersey.
Same thing.
You do any drugs?
Just coffee.
That' s all I can afford right now.
- Let me see your arms.
- Are you kidding?
Do I look like I' m kidding?
Ooh, where' d you get that scar on your wrist?
It' s a permanent burn from pulling slices for four years.
That could be the saddest thing I' ve ever heard.
- Ha, ha.
I prefer blood.
Look, are you really the owner?
'Cause I' ve had a rough couple of days, and so the last thing I need is some waitress on a power trip wastin' my time.
You start Friday night.
Be there at 11: 00.
That' s when we get busy.
- You' re givin 'me a job?
- I' m givin 'you an audition.
Don' t be late, Jersey girl.
I don' t mean to press my luck, but would you mind telling me why you' re hiring me?
Because the average male... is walking around with a toddler inside of his pants.
That' s why you' re hiring me?
You look like a kindergarten teacher.
The kids' il love it.
Sorry I asked.
I. D., please.
I' m supposed to start work here tonight.
Go ahead.
Hey, you picked a good night to start.
- Okay.
Is this a church meeting or is this a bar?
Make some noise!
- I don' t think so.
- Just in time.
- Wherey ou goin '?
- Uh, I was -- I was looking for you.
Good.
Let' s go.
- Really love your top.
- Thanks.
Hair.
- Let' s see your moves.
That' s Rachel.
You can learn a lot from her.
She just cut some guy' s pony tail off.
The court ordered her to take anger management classes... after she pummeled a customer for grabbin 'her ass.
Cheers.
- There is only two rules, okay?
What do you want?
- Two beers.
Second, don' t ever bring your boyfriends into my bar.
As of this moment you are to appear available, but never be available.
Break my rules, I fire you on the spot.
- Jesus.
Hey, everybody!
Shut up!
I' d like you to meet my new girl...
- whose name is -- - Violet.
Jersey.
- [Cheering]
- Jersey is an ex- kindergarten teacher... and a former nun who just escaped from the convent... and is tired of being the only virgin in New York City.
Would anyone like to buy her a drink?
- Come on, move!
I' m workin 'here.
- Sorry.
- Four margaritas with salt.
No mix, no salt, no blender.
- Okay, how about a black Russian?
- Got vodka, no Kahlua.
- White wine.
- Never carry the stuff.
- So basically you have -- - Jim, Jack, Johnny Red, Johnny Black and Jose.
You can have it any way you like, as long as it' s in a shot glass.
Okay, I' il take a beer.
- Four dollars.
- I' m Cammie, the Russian tease.
Violet, the Jersey nun.
That one' s Rachel, the New York bitch.
We all play our little parts, only Rachel really is a bitch.
And I really am a tease.
Yeah.
I keep forgetting that part.
I' il have a shot of tequila, and don' t forget one for your pretty little self.
Oh, thanks, but ever since I got really drunk on tequila, I never drink the stuff anymore.
Your new girl' s refusing your good booze.
No!
I was -- I was suggesting this gentleman buy me a double.
That' s more like it.
- I need eight shots.
Four Canadian, four South ofthe Border, six- pack MGD and a double- blended back.
- You want eight shots ofwhat?
- I got it.
Forty- six even, honey.
Your Jersey girl can' t quite keep up.
Hey, gimme a Scotch and water.
- Okay, you got it.
- Lil, do we serve water with our whiskey?
Only water I serve' s got barley and hops in it!
Do we serve water in this bar?
H2O!
Sink or swim time, Jersey.
Get up there!
I can' t do that dance.
- Here' s some cash.
You did okay for a nun.
- You' re firing me?
I told you this was an audition.
Now, get outta here.
Please!
Guys, guys, back off, back off.
Look, the way I see it, you got two choices.
What do you say?
- Let' s go to the bar!
Party!
Try serving a beer and pizza on Monday nights when the Giants play the Cowboys in November.
I' m giving you a second audition.
Be there at noon tomorrow.
I' m sending my fashion coordinator there to take you shopping.
Hey, and Jersey.
I' d be shocked if you survive another night.
So, uh, tell me more about this bar.
- What kind of place is it?
It' s just a bar, Dad.
It' s no big deal.
What are you eating?
Rice and vegetables.
Delicious.
- Oh!
Right?
- Mmm.
So, well, what' s going on with your song writing?
Oh!
He still has my tape.
I want my tape.
- No dates in the kitchen, O' Donnell.
- I' m not staying.
I -- I just want my tape.
- Did you really write all those songs?
You listened to my tape?
I mean, that would be invasion of privacy.
Go ahead, laugh it up.
'Cause there' s nothing you can say that' s gonna bother me.
I' m just trying to tell you I like your music.
I mean, do you always take compliments so well?
- I gotta go.
- Wait!
I wanna see you again.
Where are you workin '?
- I' m a Coyote.
- Good.
- And what the hell is that?
- If you want to see me again, you' il figure it out.
Uh- huh.
Al and I had a big fight.
And then we made up.
Twice.
You' re the fashion coordinator?
Lil told me to get you something that would make the kiddies drool.
Trust me, Violet.
I have a serious shopping problem.
- Yeah.
Who' d wear that in public?
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
Knock it off.
Lil!
How do you like that, huh?
I don' t know how you guys do it.
I can' t have another drink.
Chase it with a beer.
- I don' t get it.
- I don' t swallow it.
I just spit the shot back into the beer bottle.
You try it.
Hey, just keep an eye on your spit to on bottle.
Once Rachel served hers to Lou by accident.
Cammie, I think I just fell in love with you.
Oh, Violet!
I' ve played in the minors, but never went pro.
- Th- That' s not what I meant.
- What are you doing?
Come on.
Make yourself look busy.
- Hi.
You look like you could use a shot.
- No, I' m waiting on Lil.
If you wanna sit here, you gotta order a drink.
- Okay.
- He just ordered water.
You know what to do.
Testing.
Um, hey, everybody, this guy just ordered water.
Do we serve water in our bar?
Hell, no! H20!
Jersey!
Nobody orders water in your bar!
He can order whatever he wants.
He' s the fire marshal.
Hey, Mike, I' m so sorry.
I' m okay.
Let' s step outside.
You okay?
I can' t do this.
Of course you can.
Now cheer up, because there' s a really cute guy at the bar asking for you.
Somebody' s asking for me?
He says his name is Mr. O' Donnell.
He' s hot.
The fire marshal threatened to shut me down.
- Lil, I' m really sorry --
I' il make you a deal.
I' il let you come back tomorrow.
So much for sweet and innocent.
- So, you found me.
- Some guys at work told me where I could look for Coyotes.
Well, take a good look, because tonight' s my last night.
- Why?
- I have to make $250 in two hours.
It' s completely impossible.
Here' s nine dollars, just to get you started.
Okay?
Why are you looking at me like that?
Kevin, I don' t want your money.
All right, uh, listen up.
The bidding will start at $25... for one night only.
You get this.. pure bred, house broken, fully trained, yowling stud.
- No way.
- That' s pretty cheap.
Violet, what are you doing?
You said you wanted to help, so... turn around, sir,
let 'em take a look at ya.
Why are you doing this to me?
It' s payback time, Mr. O' Donnell.
Now, turn around.
No, God, no.
Don' t do this.
Are you in?
What' il you give me?
- I' ve got twenty bucks.
I' ve got $25 right here.
Make it 35!
Thirty- five dollars!
- Forty dollars!
- Get -- What are you doing?
- Come on, girls, fifty?
- Sixty- one dollars.
- I' ve got 70.
Seventy- five?
- Seventy- five dollars!
Eighty dollars!
Do I hear 85?
Ninety! Ninety- five dollars!
One hundred dollars!
- You wanna come home with Mama?
Shake it, shake it. - $125 back here! $140, right here.
Come on, come on.
My goodness, girls, come on.
One fifty and you' il see the butt.
You can do better than this.
One seventy- five.
Two hundred dollars!
- You' vegot 215 righ there!
- Two hundred and fifty dollars.
Sold, for $250!
He' s yours.
Damn you!
The blonde would have gone 275.
You' re gonna owe me big- time for this one.
That' s 250 even.
Better close out, girls.
- Can I ask you something?
What -- What does "Coyote Ugly" mean?
Did you ever wake up sober after a one night stand... and the person you' re next to is layin' on your arm, and they' re so ugly... you' d rather chew off your arm than risk wakin 'them?
- Let' s go, ladies.
Well, why would you name your bar after something like that?
Well, because "Cheers" was taken.
Cabs are out front.
- See ya.
Yeah.
The woman who purchased me is named Sandy Rosenfeld, a divorcee with three grown kids, a passion for long walks and short- haired hunting dogs and Italian opera.
Her ex- husband is a C. P. A. Her favorite artist is Van Gogh, and her New Year' s resolution is to lose 15 pounds -- and to see Barbra in concert.
I owe you.
What do you want?
I want what every man wants.
Breakfast.
I go to breakfast with you, and we' re even?
No.
We' re not even close to even, because I danced on a bar,
I took off my shirt, and I unzipped my pants.
Breakfast and lunch.
- Breakfast, lunch and two dinners.
- That' s four dates!
Which would make it the second longest relationship I' ve ever had.
- Get in the car.
Oh, I hate to spoil your evening, but it looks like we' re not gonna go any where.
It' s hard to find parking in New York.
This is the place.
How you doin '?
- Hi, Kevin.
Hey.
Here it is, man.
Flown in from Miami.
- Hey, man, no.
I trust you.
All right, all right.
Look, uh, I don' t know what you' re into, but --
The Amazing Spider- Man, number 129, mint condition.
- Worth a thousand bucks.
- A comic book.
This is the first appearance of the Punisher.
This is the holy grail of comic books.
- You collect comic books.
- Yeah.
It' s not cute.
- It' sjust a bit kinky.
- I think it' s sweet.
So, do you always eat breakfast on the hood of your car?
I' m a romantic.
You think this is romantic?
- you' il be on stage singing a song about this very night.
"When We Were Down wind From a Trash Barge."
Yeah.
Hum a few bars.
Sorry to disappoint you, but I' m a songwriter, not a singer.
When I get on stage, I freeze.
What if the fate of the free world rested on your voice?
If the fate of the free world depended on me singing, maybe.
All I ever really wanted is to sit in the dark... and hear someone great singing my songs.
I wanna be the one who writes the music.
I remember the first time my mother played me "Bridge Over Troubled Water"... by Simon and Garfunkel.
I remember exactly how her hair smelled.
I remember exactly how I felt.
And every time I hear that song,
I remember exactly what she was wearing... and exactly how her hair smelled... and exactly how I felt.
'Cause the great songs last forever.
- So, what' s the problem?
- Well... now they' re telling me the only way to get my songs heard... is to go out there and sing 'em myself.
So we' re gonna have to try fix this little problem straight away.
And how do you propose we do that?
Well, is there any place you feel comfortable singing?
- The shower.
- We' il start there.
- Let' s get to it.
- Okay.
Before we hit the showers, maybe you could tell me a little something about yourself.
What doyou wanna know?
What part of Australia are you from?
I' m from all over.
My family moved around a lot.
So the rest ofyour family doesn' t live in New York?
Do you always ask this many questions?
Do you always dodge this many questions?
You can at least tell me where you got all the moves you pulled on the bar tonight.
Well, if I told you, I' d have to kill you.
- Oh.
We' re gonna be late.
Late?
Late for what?
This is incredible.
- All right.
Why?
What are you talking about?
You' re gonna help me unload the next bin.
- You' re joking, right?
- I do it all the time.
- Exactly how many jobs do you have?
Sunday and Monday I park cars at the plaza.
I' ve been a telemarketer.
Would you like to switch to AT& T?
And for six terrifying hours I delivered phone books in Queens.
Don' t forget your extensive work in fish.
This is an expensive city, and these guys pay cash.
I' m not sticking my hands in that fishy bin.
I was gonna split the money with you.
- A hundred bucks?
Why didn' tyou say so?
- Wait.
- Twenty- five, ten.
Uh- huh.
That' s disgusting.
Hey, you' il hurt their feelings.
Just on top of the other fish.
There' s something I have to tell you.
You smell really bad.
I mean, I was gonna kiss you good- bye, but, um, I thought I might gag.
You' re a real charmer.
Good night.
Good morning.
Don' t look at me like that.
Spend it.
- What are you doing here?
- I changed my mind about this kiss.
I think we should give it a shot.
Well, have a nice day.
I panicked.
I didn' t know what else to say.
Have a nice day.
Back of the line over here.
- Make a hole.
Make a hole!
- Shit, the cops are here.
Look at this place.
There' s nothing we can do here.
They' re trying to shut us down.
Let' s go outside and talk.
- This is not a gas pump, son!
Wait your turn!
- Hey, no pictures, man!
- Hey, I' m a reporter from The Voice.
Let her go!
Rachel, help!
Come on! Break it up!
- I don' t know!
- Great.
- Last call, Lil.
- Start clearin '' em out.
- You got it.
Let' s go.
I mean, wow.
Even the girls.
Not a dry seat in the house.
- That I have to repeat, like, every night.
She sang along with a jukebox.
Let' s not start polishing a Grammy.
Oh, come on, Rach.
Admit it.
She saved me from kicking the shit out of a couple of drunks.
- That' s it.
- Where you goin '?
Ugh, pass out or something.
Hey, ladies and gents, how about a big round of applause for the singing Coyote from Jersey!
- So I' m a Coyote?
- Five nights a week.
What' s wrong?
Why would anything be wrong?
Um, you called me in the middle ofthe night and said there was an emergency.
What was that for?
I wanted a good- night kiss.
Well, wait a second.
Where areyou going?
Have a nice day, Mr. O' Donnell. "Have a nice day"?
Why do we need my guitar?
You' il find out soon enough.
- Just there.
Take a look.
Your fans wanna hear you sing.
I never could.
Well, that' s too bad, because they' ve requested to hear your songs.
Be gentle on the keyboard.
I borrowed it from the club.
You did all this just to help me sing?
I thought maybe we could cure that stage fright I' ve heard so much about.
Kevin, I wish you could.
Come on, let me try.
Tell me what it feels like.
You really wanna know?
You asked for it.
What are you doing?
The only way I can show you... is to make you... really... nervous.
The first thing that happens... is my heart starts to race.
Good.
Racing heart.
Yep.
- Got it.
- And then... my entire body starts shaking.
Shaking body.
I' m -- I' m getting that.
And... then everything gets... a bit... cloudy.
Clouds are definitely rolling in.
losing control.
Well, how long does this usually last?
Oh, it' s been known to last all night.
- That must be horrible.
- It' s excruciating.
I think that audience got more than they paid for, really.
What' s "L. M. S." standfor?
Lynn Marie Sanford.
It was my mom' s guitar.
She died five years ago.
She moved to New York to be a singer when she was my age.
She came pretty close to the big time.
Well, what happened?
She hated the stage.
She said it was the scariest place in the world.
Sounds familiar.
You really want me to sing?
Just tell me what I have to do.
Disappear.
All right.
Laptop.
You can lay your tracks down on a blank CD, and you' re done.
Do you -- Do you have a payment plan?
- Come on, Cammie!
What are you, brain damaged?
You know what kind of maniacs we got driving through here?
They don' t stop for nothin '.
- Whose boat?
Looks like a guy' s car to me.
- How can you tell?
- I' ve been staring at cars every day for the last 16 years.
- He' s a friend.
Thank you.
Great.
I' m starvin '.
Now tell me about this bar.
Is it a bunch of bankers havin 'martinis afterwork?
Look.
I loveyou.
- I love you too.
Hey, do I come to your office and honk?
I got you a gig.
There' s this club where a lot of music people hang out called the Elbow Room.
My friend' s the manager.
He owes me a favor, and you' re it, next Thursday night.
Are you forgetting about the stage fright?
Uh, what about the bar?
All I do is sing along with the jukebox.
See?
You' re making progress.
I hate to burst your bubble, but I' il never be cured.
It' s genetic.
Stage fright DNA.
Yes, I saw that on E. R. last week.
Okay.
Laugh all you want, but my mom couldn' t do it, and neither can I.
So was your mother afraid to try?
Look, I just wanna be a song writer.
Why won' t you give up on this?
Because I' ve been giving up on people my entire life, and it' s a nasty little habit.
So, you' re gonna sing at the club, or I' il --
Or you' il what?
I' il never kiss you again.
That sounds like a threat, Mr. O' Donnell.
Well, let' s just say... it' s gonna be quite a long, cold winter.
That' s supposed to convince me?
It' s working, isn' t it?
Your knees are getting weak.
- I' il think about it.
- Try again.
Uh, I' il see ifI can get offwork.
You' re gettin 'warmer.
All right.
You win.
I' il do it.
for you tonight, boys and girls.
- [Shouts]
I' m a paying customer tonight.
What are you doing?
- Come on, Zoe!
- No!
- Excuse me, does Violet Sanford work here?
- Yeah, she' s on the bar.
- She' s on thebar.
- What do you guys say?
I just sing here every night.
- People come here to see me.
- Say something!
- The guys are putting your picture up in their booths!
- I gotta go, get up early.
- Dad, it' s just a bar.
- You can trust me.
- But you' re my daughter.
[Bill' s Voice On Machine]
- Please leave a message when you hear the beep.
Dad, you can' t avoid me for the rest of your life.
I have to come over and do your laundry.
We both know you' re running out of clean shirts.
- I bet the one you' re wearing stinks pretty bad.
- [Sniffs]
And I' m not sure I am, so --
I' m playing at a club tonight.
A real club.
Someone important could hear my song, and next month somebody might be singing it on the radio.
- So wish me good luck.
- Good luck.
Anyway, um, I' il call you and tell you how it goes.
Take care of yourself, old man.
Old man.
You should be dancing on the floor!
- Is this the greatest party we' ve ever been to or what, man?
Lil, I can only stay two hours.
- What are you talking about?
- I gotta leave early tonight, remember?
Maybe you haven' t noticed all the bodies you had to crawl over to get in here tonight.
- Four!
- Got it.
Seven.
- What are you doing?
I gotta go.
It' s halfpast.
Listen, Jersey.
This place us out of control.
I' m only working two hours --
You wanna sing?
These people dragged their asses out here to see us.
This is New York, and there' s a line halfway around the block.
That' s something, Jersey, whether you believe it or not.
- Where areyou?
- Lil won' t let me go.
Violet, just walk out.
She doesn' t own you.
You can still make it here.
I' m -- I' m sorry.
- I' il call you tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
Violet.
- What' s the story?
So what am I supposed to do, Kevin?
I' m sorry, Richie.
I made a mistake.
A deal' s a deal.
Zach, who said you could be up here?
You' re not supposed to be up here.
Take it easy, Zach.
Zach, take it easy.
- Hey, hey, knock it off.
- Kevin!
- Break it up!
- [Man]
- [Grunting]
Kevin, that' s enough!
- Get off me!
Stopit!
- Kevin, Zach' s a regular, and he was just having fun.
- Having fun with my girlfriend!
- You' re gonna chill outside, or I' m calling the cops.
Out of my way!
[Kevin]
- Hey, everybody, free drinks on the house.
I' m paying.
Get up here.
What is your problem?
There was no way Lil was gonna let me out.
This is about you and this place.
- There is myjob.
- It' s a goddamn sand box for you to stick your head in.
All right?
- And what would you have me do?
- Sing for quarters in the park?
- Well, at least you' d be singing your own songs.
I told you I can' t do that, so stop pushing!
I' m just asking you to try, but I guess that' s asking a bit too much.
It' s so easy to be you, isn' t it?
You have no dreams, no hopes, no chance of getting hurt.
When was the last time you took a chance on something?
- Some of us don' t have that luxury.
Oh, right.
We don' t talk about you, right?
Come on, Kevin.
I' m gonna guess why you left Australia.
- Doesn' t matter.
- You... were in jail.
Come on.
I don' t have a lot of time.
Why' d you run away from home?
I didn' t have a home.
Is that what you wanted to hear?
I don' t have a family.
I mean, that' s the big secret.
Are you gonna feel sorry for me now?
You gonna hold me close while I tell you I had to change homes every two years?
I had a bad childhood.
Big deal.
I don' t need your sympathy, 'cause I' m here, and I' m living on my two feet like I wanted to.
That was my dream.
And at least I did it with a little bit of dignity.
And I didn' t.
Well, just unbutton the blouse a little and unzip the pants, show a little bit offlesh, I think you can figure it out.
[Car Door Opens, Closes]
Your fans are waitin 'for ya to crawl on a bar.
I told you not to break the rules.
I' m talking about you and your boyfriend making a scene in my bar.
I' m talking about a friend of mine inside with a broken nose.
The rules were simple, Jersey.
I' ve fired girls for a lot less.
What, so I can' t have a boyfriend now?
Hey!
This place is my home, and I' m not willing to risk everything I have on your personal life.
It' s business, plain and simple.
I worked my ass off for you, and you' re supposed to be my friend.
I never said I was your friend.
I' m your boss, and you knew the rules like everybody else.
Will you stop... with "the rules"?
It' s a bar, for Christ' s sake!
Then what are you so upset about?
- Mmm, thank you.
- How does it feel to be Mrs. Molinaro?
You know, I think he was a perfect choice for my first marriage.
Hey, Gloria.
- Thanks for inviting me, uh --
I gotta go to work.
I' m on graveyard tonight.
- Yeah, well, it' s not worth a hug, dear.
- It' s only 50 bucks.
- Your old man' s a ten, Vi.
- Eleven, some days a twelve.
Well, it' s a beautiful wedding.
I just want one picture ofyou and Violet dancing together.
You' re not gonna return my phone calls?
If you needed money, you should have come to me.
I would have found a way to take care ofyou.
Dad, you can' t even take care of yourself.
Hey, I am doing just fine on my own, thank you very much.
So how come you' re not wearing any socks?
What bothers me...
I was ashamed ofyou.
Leave a message after the beep.
Violet?
I' m going to unload three disgusting fish trucks.
I thought maybe you' d like to come and give me a hand.
I' m coming.
Oryou' re not picking up, so I' il call back... because I' m hoping one day you... will wanna talk.
Hello?
Kevin?
Hello?
It' s me.
Is this Violet Sanford?
- Yes.
- I' m calling from Riverview Medical Center.
We have a patient here by the name of William James Sanford.
Violet Sanford?
- Your dad' s in recovery right now.
The car struck him on his right side when he was walking to the booth.
His right leg is broken, and there was some arterial damage we had to go in and repair.
But other than that, it' s just a lot of bumps and bruises.
I' d say he' s a pretty lucky guy.
Violet?
I told you, don' t come down here.
It' s your wedding night.
Oh, are you kidding?
You' ve been in my family my whole life.
Mmm, I' m sorry.
I love you... so much.
I never did thank you for the dance.
That' s okay.
My tapes.
Just call him.
Just pick up the phone and call him.
Don' t call him.
Told you.
This place is a palace.
It' s pretty late.
Are you sure you wanna do this now?
Well, here' s my door.
No turning back now.
Oh, you' re so right.
This place is a palace.
- This is a great idea.
- Nice strong pulse.
Don' t look at me like that.
I' m a sick man.
You can eat whatever you want now, but when we go back home, it' s egg whites and Lean Cuisines.
- I' il see you later, Bill.
What do you mean, "until we go home"?
- I' m moving back.
I couldn' t do it.
I couldn' t sing my songs.
- I was afraid.
Do you know why Mommy quit?
Yeah, she told me -- 'cause she couldn' t do it.
No, that' s not it.
She wasn' t afraid, Vi.
Your mother on stage -- Oh, she was amazing.
Then why did she quit?
Because of me.
Right after you were born, she told me she wanted to quit, and I let her.
See, I knew how good she was, but I never told her.
I loved her... more than anything.
And I just went on and pretended that there was no other choice.
- Dad, it' s okay.
- No, it' s not okay.
You' re not goin 'back to work for Pete.
I don' t care how many bars you have to stand on.
You are not comin 'home.
I' m not letting you back in the house.
Forget it.
Hmm?
No!
Oh, well, it' s just a... splash of Old Spice.
Where did you get Old Spice?
That nice redheaded nurse gave it to me as a gift.
Then she asked me out for coffee.
I' m scared.
Are you gonna go on a date?
God, a date.
I better buy a pair of socks.
Come on in here.
Watch out for the -- Okay.
Okay if I eat here at the bar?
- Do you have a reservation?
- Uh, yeah.
It' s under, um, "cast- iron heartless bitch."
Yes.
That' s the one.
I' il have a double water on the rocks, please.
- How' d you find me?
She told me about your pop.
I' m sorry to hear about that.
He' s okay.
- Yeah.
Yeah, I can see that.
What' s good to eat here?
Lil, you didn' t come here to eat.
I just wanted to let you know you can come back to the bar whenever you want.
- I appreciate the offer, but I' m okay here.
You were never a lifer.
I' m married to that bar.
I' d sleep there if I had the guts to walk around barefoot.
- But that' s me, you know?
I' m the original Coyote -- just a small town gal trying to make it in the big bad city.
"Small town gal"?
Piedmont, North Dakota.
You ever tell anyone that, I' il kill ya.
Take care, Jersey.
You have one new message.
- [Cat Meows]
I have one message in eight hours.
Violet, this is Lyndsey Morgan from the Bowery Ballroom.
Listen, we loved your CD, and we want you to play in our song writer' s showcase next Sunday night.
So drop your music by the club, and the house band can learn your song.
Now if you have any questions, don' t be afraid to give me a shout.
It' s all yours.
I can' t thank you enough for subleasing me this place.
And when is your boyfriend moving in?
He' s actually coming in tomorrow from Boston.
Ta- da.
Will you hang that outside for me?
- Hey, Lou, you got that number I asked you about?
So why are you moving to Chicago?
[Sighs]
- Hey, do yourself a favor and look at page 137 of The Voice.
I can' t believe your name is in the paper.
Dad, ifyou' re not ready in five minutes, I' m gonna leave without you.
Keep your pants on, will ya?
I only got three rolls offiilm.
Dad, I' m only singing one song.
Better go get another one.
[Man Laughing]
My kid' s singing tonight at some club in the city.
Hey, maybe you can give us a one, two, three for luck.
You got it.
All right, let' s give it up for Bill Sanford' s daughter.
- Light 'em up.
One, two, three.
- [Bells Ringing]
[Ringing Continues]
- [Tires Screeching]
Did I mention to you that I was recently in a horrifiic car accident?
I -- I can' t do this.
I gotta go back.
- Yes.
You have nothing to be afraid of.
You' re already a star.
- Dad, what areyou talking about?
- If you' re such a nobody, then why did I buy this off Pete for 20 bucks?
- Why doyou have that?
- I saw it on the wall, decided I wanted the first autograph.
I figured it' d be a damn good investment.
Now what are you waiting for?
I didn' t spend three months in physicalt herapy... just to take a ride to the state line, you got me?
- Yeah, I gotya.
- So what do you say, Vi?
How about another U- ey?
You guys call in a one, two, three!
Now, let' s do it again.
- This time I wanna feel chills!
There goes Bill again.
Come on now!
The only reason why I came down here tonight is to see her fall on her face.
Oh, take it easy, Rachel.
- Excuse me.
- I' m cool.
Good evening, ladies.
Can I help you?
It' s packed, Lyndsey.
If she' s not here in five, she' s bumped.
Uh, now that we' re here, I' m feeling a little nervous.
Thank you, Mr. Sanford.
Oh, oh, probably just car sick.
I' m fiine.
Vi.
We' re right behind you.
Break a leg, sweetie.
[Announcer]
Ladies and gentlemen, making her Bowery Ballroom debut, Miss Violet Sanford!
I' m sorry.
Don' t do it, Rach.
He' s a big guy, and you' re still on probation.
Don' t worry.
Those classes are really paying off.
Let' s give a big Coyote welcome to LeAnn Rimes.
So tell me, what do you do when you realize that all your dreams have come true?
You pay off old debts.
The original appearance of the Punisher -- the one I cost you.
Jersey! Jersey!
In true Coyote tradition, I' m gonna make every woman' s night... and auction off the most handsome little hottie in the place.
You can' t do this to me again.
- Here he is, girls.
- [Cheering]
The bidding will start at $25.
- $25!
- [Laughing]
Come on, girls.
There' s a lot of miles left on these tires. - $50!
Strut your stuff.
Take -- Take some of it off.
My name is Turkish.
Funny name for an Englishman, I know.
My parents were on the same plane when it crashed.
That' s how they met.
They named me after the plane.
Not many people are named after a plane crash.
That' s Tommy.
He tells people he was named after a gun.
But I know he was really named after a famous 19th century ballet dancer.
Known him for as long as I can remember.
He' s my partner.
Doesn' t mean we hold hands or take walks.
It means I try to keep him out of as much trouble as he inflicts on me.
I give him a hard time.
Keeps him in check.
But really, he' s like my brother.
What do I know about diamonds?
I' m a boxing promoter.
I was a happy boxing promoter until a week ago, and then:
What do I know about diamonds?
Don' t they come from Antwerp?
- Do we have a choice?
It wasn' t meant to be taken literally.
It' s a nice story, Adam and Eve.
It' s bound with moral fibre...... but asking a grown man to believe it?
What is it?
Well, what is it?
What you want I should do, drop my pants?
Okay, go through.
It' s a nice story.
Just a story.
Catholic religion is based on a mistranslation.
Enough already.
Ruben, say something.
Listen.
Are you busy?
I' il tell you the whole story.
The Septuagint scholars mistranslated the Hebrew word for "young woman"...... into the Greek word for "virgin."
It was an easy mistake to make...... because there was only a subtle difference in the spelling.
So, they came up with a prophecy:
"Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear us a son."
You understand?
It was "virgin" that caught people' s attention.
It' s not everyday a virgin conceives and bears a son.
But leave that for a couple of hundred years to stew...... and next thing you know you have the Holy Catholic Church.
Oy vay, what are you saying?
I' m saying, just because it' s written...... doesn' t make it so.
Gives them hope.
It' s not important whether it' s fact or fiction.
- People like to believe.
- I don' t want to hear anymore.
Anyway, who is it that we' re seeing?
- Michael.
- Hello?
Mutti.
Rudy!
Rud, Rud, let them in, please.
Rud, it' s okay, let them through.
- Michael.
- Mutti.
You' ve kept us waiting for half an hour.
Are you trying to give me heartburn?
Lie down on the floor.
Get on the floor!
Lie on the floor!
Get on the fucking floor!
- Get down!
- Get fucking down!
Down on the floor!
Get down!
On the ground!
Get down, I say!
- Time.
- Seven minutes!
Where is the stone?
Where is the stone?
Where is the stone?
Michael, where is the stone?
When does your plane leave?
Twenty minutes.
Give me your gun.
When you get to London...... if you want a gun...... call this number.
- Boris.
- Boris.
He can get you anything you need.
ls he allowed to do that?
It' s an unlicensed boxing match.
It' s not a tickling competition.
These lads are out to hurt each other.
What' s with those sausages, Charlie?
Two minutes, Turkish.
Look at it.
How am I supposed to run this thing from that?
We' il need a proper office.
I want a new one.
You' re going to buy it for me.
Why me?
Well, you know about caravans.
How' s that?
You spent a summer in one.
Which means you know more than me.
And I don' t want to have me pants pulled down over the price.
What' s wrong with this one?
Oh, nothing, Tommy.
It' s tiptop.
I' m just not sure about the colour.
It' s all arranged.
You just got to pick it up.
Here' s an address.
It' s a campsite.
You' ve got 10 grand, and it would be nice to see change.
- What' s happening with them sausages?
- Five minutes.
It was two minutes five minutes ago.
They ain' t pikeys, are they?
I fucking hate pikeys.
You' re a sensitive boy, Tommy.
Fuck me.
Hold tight.
- What' s that?
- It' s me belt.
No, Tommy.
There' s a gun in your trousers.
- What' s a gun doing in your trousers?
- It' s for protection.
"Zee" Germans?
What' s to stop it blowing your bollocks off when you sit?
- Where did you get it?
- Boris The Blade.
You mean Boris the sneaky, fucking Russian.
Heavy, isn' t it?
Heavy is good.
Heavy is reliable.
lf it doesn' t work, you can always hit him with it.
Boris The Blade, or Boris The Bullet- Dodger.
Bent as the Soviet sickle and hard as the hammer that crosses it.
Apparently, it' s just impossible to kill the bastard.
Back to my partner, Tommy.
Tommy runs the other business...... the slot machines...... which keeps rain off our heads and gloves on Gorgeous' hands.
However, Tommy' s a little preoccupied with protection at present.
All right, I' il take it.
There' s a reason for Tommy' s newfound enthusiasm for firearms.
Sooner or later, in unlicensed boxing, you have to deal with that reason:
Brick Top.
lf that' s not worth a bet, I don' t know what is.
- He doesn' t look bad, does he?
- No, he looks great.
He' il do you proud.
You reckon that' s what people should do for me, Gary?
Do me proud?
It' s what you deserve.
Pull your tongue out of my arsehole.
Dogs do that.
You' re not a dog, are you?
No.
No, I' m not.
However...... you do have all the characteristics of a dog, Gary.
All except loyalty.
It' s rumoured that his favourite means of dispatch involves a stun gun...... a plastic bag, a roll of tape and a pack of hungry pigs.
You' re a ruthless little cunt, Liam.
I' il give you that.
But I got no time for grouses.
Feed him to the pigs, Errol.
What the fuck are you two looking at?
If you got to deal with him, just make sure you don' t end up owing him.
Then you' re in his debt.
Which means, you' re in his pocket.
And once you' re in that, you ain' t ever coming out.
I hear he' s a good fighter, so I' il use him.
I' il be doing you a favour, boy.
What he means is, I' m doing him a favour.
Unlike his.
Here, Errol, I don' t think he likes me.
You don' t like me, do you?
Don' t know what you mean.
I do know I can' t wait to get out of here.
It stinks.
My fights finish prompt so we can get out before the authorities find out.
Play your cards right and I' il sort you out.
You can sort me out by showing me out.
It' s hard to make a living in boxing, so now and then...... you do something against your principles.
Basically, you have to forget you got any.
Are they Lancashire pigs?
Who' s talking to you?
Oh, yeah, Tommy.
Brick Top loves Tommy.
Don' t let me down.
You don' t want to let me down, do you?
See you ringside.
Boris, Franky- fucking- Four Fingers...... has a diamond the size of a fist.
I have told you it' s in the briefcase connected to his arm.
I sent him to you to buy a gun.
What more do you want me to do, hit him for you?
But don' t you hit him either.
Americans can' t know it was Russian.
It will come back to me.
You' re my brother, so think like it.
Get somebody else to steal that stone!
I don' t want it getting back to me.
And don' t have him killed.
It will raise suspicion.
So don' t use idiots for the job.
He' il stay in London a couple of days before he goes to New York...... so move quick.
Okay?
One more thing.
It might help.
He loves to gamble.
Eighty- six carats?
Brilliant cut, beautiful make.
A beautiful stone.
You' re a good boy, Franky.
And you did a real good job.
Now when do you get back?
I got to move the two- grainers here, get a better price.
Couple of days.
- Talk to my cousin Dougie.
- Doug The Head?
And Franky....
- And what?
- Stay out of those casinos.
You did a goodjob, bubbe.
- Don' t go screwing it up, all right?
- I hear you, Avi.
I' il see you, Avi.
Eighty- six carats.
- Where?
- London.
- London?
- London.
- Yes, London.
You know, fish, chips, cup of tea...... bad food, worse weather, Mary- fucking- Poppins.
Not for me.
That' s Doug The Head.
Everybody knows Doug The Head.
If it' s stones and it' s stolen, he' s the man to speak to.
Pretends he' s Jewish.
Wishes he was Jewish.
Even tells his family they' re Jewish...... but he' s about as Jewish as he is a fucking monkey.
He thinks it' s good for business.
And in the diamond business...
-... it is good for business.
- Avi!
He' il be there today.
Take care of him.
Avi, you know I won' t buy schtrops.
He isn' t selling schtrops.
Make it smaller.
Who do you take me for?
This is England.
We play by the rules.
Listen to me.
lf the stones are kosher, then I' il buy them, won' t l?
Now, if you' il excuse me, it' s my lunchtime.
Bye.
What are you doing here?
It' s a free country, isn' t it?
Well, it ain' t a free shop, is it?
So fuck off.
I want to see you two girls up in my office.
I had cousin Avi on the phone.
- You got to go see him.
- Yeah, Dad.
You told us.
- He' s a big mucker in New York.
- Yeah, Dad.
You told us.
I want to see you girls up in my office.
Yeah, Dad.
You told us.
The weight is sign of reliability.
I always go for reliability.
I' il take it.
How much do you want for it?
Nothing.
Okay, so what do you want for it?
I want you to do something for me.
There is a fight in couple of days.
What kind of a fight?
Unlicensed boxing.
There is a bookies I know that will take bets.
lf you place one down for me...... we will call it quits.
- Why don' t you put it down yourself?
- Well...... there is not too many bookies that takes those kind of bets.
And I already have an outstanding debt with the house.
I know something most don' t.
So, nu?
What do you know?
It' s a campsite.
A pikey campsite.
- Ten points.
- What are we doing here?
- We' re buying a caravan.
- Off a pack of fucking pikeys?
What' s wrong with you?
This will get messy.
Not if you' re here.
Oh, you bastard.
I fucking hate pikeys.
That' s a flash car, mister.
Not as flash as your bike.
Who are you looking for?
Mr. O' Neil.
- Want me to get him?
- That' s a good lad.
Piss off.
- Are you going to go get him for me?
- Yeah.
- What are you waiting for?
- The five quid you' il pay me.
Fuck off, I' il find him meself.
- Two fifty.
- You can have a quid.
You' re a real tight fucker.
There was a problem with gypsies.
What' re you doing?
Get out of the way, man.
You can' t understand what' s being said.
You Tommy?
Come about the caravan?
- Mr. O' Neil.
- Fuck, man.
Call me Mickey.
Not Irish, not English.
- How are you?
- Weather' s been kind.
It' s just Pikey.
Would you look at the size of him?
How big are you?
- Kids, how big is he?
- Big, for sure.
Hey, Mam, come and look at the size of this fella.
Bet you box a little, can' t you, sir?
You look like a boxer.
Get out of the way.
See if they' d like a drink.
I could murder one.
Be no murdering done around here, I don' t mind telling you.
Get your hands out of there.
Cup of tea for the big fella?
Don' t be silly, Mickey.
Offer the man a proper drink.
You little bugger.
- ls the big fella not coming with us?
- He' s minding the car.
- What does he think we are, thieves?
- No, nothing like that.
- He just likes looking after cars.
- Good dags.
Do you like dags?
- Dags?
- What?
- Yeah, dags.
- Dags.
You like dags?
Oh, dogs.
Sure, I like dags.
- I like caravans more.
- You' re very welcome.
Pikeys are well- known for their skills of negotiation in business.
It' s probably why they talk like that...... so you can' t follow what' s being said.
But if Tommy can get the caravan for less than the price asked...... on his return there will be ice cream.
Good dog, good family.
He' il get a little homesick, but he' il get over it.
See you later, lads.
See you, boss.
All right, Mickey.
Laters.
I don' t see what the fuss is about.
They aren' t bad fellas.
The deal was, you bought it how you saw it.
Look, I' ve helped you as much as I' m going to help you.
See that car?
Use it.
You should fuck off now while you still got the legs to carry you.
Nobody brings you...... unless they' re trying to say something without talking.
Just give our money back and you can keep your caravan.
Why do I want a caravan that' s got no wheels?
- You want to settle this with a fight?
- Over my dead body.
Go on!
I' il not have you fighting!
You know what happens when you fight!
Get her to sit down.
For fuck' s sake!
Want the money?
I ain' t fucked you.
I' il fight you for it.
You and me.
So that' s the kind of fight it' il be.
You want to stay down.
You want to stay down!
Get back down and fucking stay down.
I promise you, you want to stay down.
Deadly kick for a fat fucker, you know that?
Cheeky bastard.
- Okay, lads.
- Get him on his feet.
Get back down...... or you will not be coming up next time.
Bollocks to you.
This is sick.
I' m out of here.
You' re not going anywhere, you thick lump.
You stay until the job' s done.
It turned out that the sweet- talking, tattoo- sporting pikey...... was a gypsy bare- knuckle boxing champion.
Which makes him harder than a coffin nail.
Right now that' s the last thing on Tommy' s mind.
If Gorgeous doesn' t wake up in the next few minutes...... Tommy knows he' il be buried with him.
Why would the gypsies want to explain...... why a man died in their campsite?
Not when they can bury the pair of them and just move camp.
It' s not like they got social security numbers, is it?
Tommy, "The Tit"...... is praying.
And if he isn' t...... he fucking should be.
Bad Boy.
- Sol.
- Easy.
No, it' s a moissanite.
A what?
A moissanite is an artificial diamond, Lincoln.
It' s Mickey Mouse.
Spurious.
Not genuine.
And it' s worth...... fuck- all.
Bad Boy, I keep telling you, stick to being a gangster.
Leave this game to me and Sol.
Laters.
What is that, Vince?
This is a dog, Sol.
You are not bringing that thing in here.
It' s only a fucking dog.
- The gyppos.
Here.
They threw it in with the moody gold.
You know gyppos, Sol.
They' re always throwing dogs in with deals.
It better not be dangerous.
What do you think you' re doing now?
I want him to get used to the shop, don' t l?
Stop the dog!
Come back!
All right, Boris?
- Don' t worry about the dog.
- I' m not.
What can I do for you?
I have a job for you.
I already have a job.
Fifty grand for half a day' s work.
Go on.
I want you to hold up a bookies.
From Russia with love, eh?
I have stones to sell...... fat to chew and many men to see about many ducks...... so if I am not rushing you....
Slow down, Franky, my son.
When in Rome.
I am not in Rome, Doug.
I am in a rush.
I got to make the bookies.
Bookies?
- What are you betting on?
- Bomber Harris.
The unlicensed boxer?
Do you know something that I don' t?
Bubbe, I probably know a lot you don' t.
He' s bad to the bone, ain' t you, Tyrone?
Of course I am.
Tyrone' il drive for us.
He' s done a rally driving course.
Of course I have.
I don' t want that dog dribbling on my seats.
Your seats?
Tyrone, this is a stolen car, mate.
While I' m at the wheel, it' s my car...... so stop that dog dribbling on my seats.
All right?
I can' t believe you found it.
Where' d it go?
It went back to the gyppos.
Shut up.
And how could it find them?
Well, I don' t know.
I' m not a dog, Sol.
Ask him.
It' s like he' s a fucking homing beacon.
Steady on the brakes.
I thought you said he could drive, Sol.
Don' t worry about me.
Just worry about that dog on my seats.
All right?
What?
You said he was a getaway driver.
What the fuck can he get away from?
Don' t worry about Tyrone.
He can move when he has to.
Worry about getting us a gun.
What' s that?
This is a shotgun, Sol.
It' s a fucking anti- aircraft gun, Vincent.
- I want to raise pulses, don' t l?
- You' il raise hell, never mind pulses.
That does not look like a bookies.
Why' d we stop here?
What' s the matter with that space over there?
It' s too tight.
Too tight?
You could land a jumbo- fucking- jet in there.
Leave him alone.
He' s a natural.
Ain' t you, Tyrone?
Of course I am.
A natural fucking idiot.
Tyrone, what' ve you done?
Yeah, Tyrone, what have you done?
Look, you hassle me, you see what happens.
It' s all right.
No, don' t move it now.
People' il see the damage.
Why' d you do that?
I didn' t see it.
It' s a four- ton truck.
It' s not like it' s a packet of fucking peanuts.
It was at a funny angle.
It' s behind you, Tyrone.
Whenever you reverse, things come from behind you.
Control that dog as well.
- Get that dog off him.
- Get it off me.
Give me that squeaky toy.
It shut him up last time.
Don' t snatch.
He can' t swallow the whole ball.
Yeah.
Why the fuck...... did you put Gorgeous George...... into a bare- knuckle boxing match...... two days before he had to fight The Bomber?
He was half his size.
I didn' t expect him to get hurt.
You put the man into a bare- knuckle boxing match.
What the fuck did you expect?
A grease- down and a shiatsu?
Who took the jam out of your doughnut?
You took the fucking jam out of my doughnut.
You did.
You said get a good deal.
I fail to recognize the correlation...... between losing 10 grand, hospitalizing Gorgeous...... and a good deal.
How' il we explain this to Brick Top?
That his fight won' t happen?
We replace the fighter.
Oh, and hope he doesn' t notice?
Who the fuck will we replace him with?
What about John The Gun?
Or Mad Fist Willy?
You' re not Mr. Current Affairs, are you?
Mad Fist went mad...... and The Gun shot himself.
Jesus.
What?
Let' s use the fucking pikey.
- How much you gonna pay us?
- 10 K.
Me bollocks.
Lose more than that running for the bus.
All right.
I' il do it for a caravan.
A what?
A caravan.
- Top of the range and all that.
- It was us that wanted a caravan.
Anyway, what' s wrong with this one?
It' s not for me.
It' s for me ma.
Your what?
His ma.
Brick Top runs an illegal bookies.
They take bets on anything that involves blood and pain.
Now I' m changing fighters...... and Brick Top' s gonna exploit the situation.
He' s gonna pull my pants down, grease me up...... and aim for penetration.
If I didn' t have the replacement pikey...... he' d want to split me in half.
They could charm the paint off walls, these fellas.
Look mean now, you hairy fucker, won' t you?
Shits himself when you put him in the ring.
Poke him with a stick, you watch his bollocks grow.
Do you like a dog fight, Turkish?
We' ve lost Gorgeous George.
You' re gonna have to repeat that.
We' ve lost Gorgeous George.
Well, where' d you lose him?
He ain' t a set of fucking car keys, is he?
And it' s not as if he' s incon- fucking- spicuous, is it?
We' re not backing out.
You bet your bollocks to a barn dance you' re not.
We' re changing the fighter.
Oh, fuck me, your lady friend got a voice?
Who are you changing him to, sweetheart?
You won' t know him, but he' s mustard.
Mustard?
I don' t care if he' s Muhammad "I' m Hard" Bruce Lee...... you can' t change fighters.
- You' ve still got your fight.
- No.
I lose all bets at the bookies.
You can' t change fighters.
So, no, I don' t have my fight, do I, you fucking prat?
You can take bets at the fight.
Put a lead on her, Turkish, before she gets bitten.
Do you want to get bitten, sweetheart?
Make sure your man goes down in the fourth.
You understand me now, don' t you, Turkish?
This is the one place I didn' t want to be:
In his debt.
Which now means I' m in his pocket.
You' re on thin- fucking- ice, my pedigree chums.
And I shall be under it when it breaks.
Now, fuck off.
Doug, where' s Franky Four Fingers?
I don' t know.
I' m not his mother.
But I' m seeing him later.
- When later?
- He said he wanted cash.
So he' s coming back after he' s been to a fight.
A fight?
What do you mean, a fight?
A boxing match?
- ls there gambling involved?
- It' s a boxing match, Avi.
- Did he have a case with him?
- Yes, he had a case.
And this schmuck is gambling?
You' re talking about Franky "I' ve got a problem with gambling" Four Fingers.
Avi, I' m not telepathic.
You' re plenty stupid, I' il give you that.
Do you know why they call him Franky Four Fingers?
I have no idea.
Because he makes stupid bets with dangerous people.
When he doesn' t pay up, they give him the chop.
And I' m not talking about his fucking foreskin.
I' m sure he can pay.
Not with my goods.
Got a toothbrush?
We' re going to London.
Do you hear that?
I' m coming to London!
- Avi!
- Shut up and sit down, you bald fuck!
I don' t like leaving my own country...... especially leaving it for anything less than warm, sandy beaches...... and cocktails with little straw hats.
We' ve got sandy beaches.
So who the fuck wants to see them?
I hope you can appreciate the concern I have for my friend Franky.
I' il find him, and you' il help me find him.
And we' il start at that fight.
How am I gonna get it out?
It will probably cough it up.
Will he be all right?
I hope not.
- Are we gonna rob this bookies?
- Yes, big man.
Why are we waiting?
We are waiting for a man with four fingers, carrying a briefcase.
And why' s that?
Because the deal is, the Russian gets the case, we get the money.
What' s in the case?
For fuck' s sake, Tyrone, just concentrate on the steering wheel.
Jesus.
- Private night tonight, chaps.
- I' m well aware of that, my son.
That' s why we' re here.
Well done.
This is the back way in.
Oh, really?
I thought it was the front.
- Private night tonight, chaps.
- We know.
That' s why we' re here.
Tickets.
Are we ever gonna get into this place?
Avi, Avi, you gotta understand.
This ain' t exactly Vegas, and this ain' t exactly legal.
I' m not looking for Vegas or for legal.
I' m looking for Franky.
I know that, and he said he' s gonna be here.
- lf there' s gambling, he' il be here.
- Let' s not have a fuck- up.
You won' t let us down.
He' s going down in the fourth, don' t you worry about that.
ls that him?
I don' t know.
How many fingers did he have?
Sorry, I didn' t get the binoculars out in time.
Let' s not stand on ceremony.
Let' s start the show.
Do you know who this bookies belongs to?
lf you know what' s good for you you' il give me everything --
What are you doing?
What does it look like I' m doing up here?
This is starting to hurt, Solomon.
Drop the screen now.
How you doing, Vince?
I' d do a lot better if you' d stop using my name.
- Fill that bag.
- All bets are off.
I am not in here to make a fucking bet.
Appreciated...... but all bets...... are...... off.
lf all bets are off, then there can' t be any money, can there?
I ain' t fucking buying that.
That' s handy because I ain' t fucking selling it.
It' s a fact.
What have you got?
Nothing, really.
A few coins, but no notes.
Show me your hands.
You' ve got five fingers.
Copper coins.
What do you mean, copper- fucking- coins?
It won' t open because it' s a security door.
Hold that.
My leg.
What are you moaning about?
It didn' t even touch it.
We' re fucked.
What the fuck are you two doing?
Get us out of here.
Tyrone, what are you doing?
Get us out of here!
Who the fuck is this man, Tyrone?
He' s a man with four fingers and a briefcase, Vinny.
ln the red corner...... we have the young and unchallenged....
So, Mickey, you' re going down in the fourth. ls that clear?
Just make sure he doesn' t kill me.
So give it up for the bone- crunching...... one- punch machine gun...... Mickey!
And in the other corner....
Now, I know he looks like a fat fucker --
Well, he is a fat fucker, but he' s dirty and he' s dangerous.
Bomber "The Mad Man" Harris!
Let' s get ready...... to rumble!
Do you realize I' m fucking forty grand down?
What' s the fucking crack?
- I' il make it up to you.
- I ain' t happy.
I' il make it up to you, I promise.
Stand on me.
Oh, that fucking pikey' s put me in it.
Thanks for the tip, Brick Top.
Listen, you fucking fringe, if I throw a dog a bone...... l don' t want to know if it tastes good.
Stop me again whilst I' m walking and I' il cut your fucking jacobs off.
- He' s here.
- Well, you explain it to him.
- The case was attached to his arm.
So why didn' t you chop it off?
We ain' t fucking butchers, Boris.
But he has the case.
Look, we -- Well, you have a problem.
There weren' t much cash at the bookies.
Okay.
Here is the 10 grand.
No.
Keep it.
We want this.
Well, at least half of this.
What was in the case was mine.
What was in the bookies was yours.
Okay?
It wasn' t much, but here is the 10 large to help the situation.
No, I' m afraid it' s too late for that.
We want half of this, and that' s because we' re being generous.
We could, by all rights, keep the whole fucking stone, Boris.
Watch out!
Drop the gun, fat boy.
You fucking idiots.
He could not know my name.
Give me the stone.
- It' s in the case.
- What?
It' s in the case.
You put the stone in the case?
Open it and give me the stone.
The only man who knew the combination, you just shot.
Now, it' s not too clever to hang about after Mickey' s performance.
Brick Top, in short, will be looking to kill Tommy, Mickey and myself.
I know he' s looking for us, but I don' t have a choice.
I' m happy to leave the country, but I need money to do so.
But any money I have is in the safe, which is in the office.
Once I have that, it' s --
Shit.
So that' s where you keep the sugar.
What brings you two here?
Run out of pants to sniff?
That sounds like hostility, doesn' t it?
And we don' t like hostility, do we, Errol?
No, we don' t, John.
I just had them polished.
Go and put the kettle on.
- No, thank you, Turkish.
I' m sweet enough.
He' s now your problem.
Okay?
You can keep the 10 grand, along with the body...... but if I see you again, you motherfuckers....
Well, look at him.
I want to use the pikey.
All right.
Of course.
Of course, fucking of course.
I wasn' t asking, I was telling.
But this time...... l do want him to go down in the fourth.
And I do mean it, this time.
Now, I know you come back here to open your safe.
So now you can open it.
Turkish has been a busy little bastard.
I think he' s got away with enough.
I shouldn' t do so much of it.
That takes care of one little piggy.
Now find me the silly sods who blagged the bookies.
Find them today.
Top of the morning to you, Mrs. O' Neil.
Tommy.
You' re a snake in the grass, ain' t you?
Where' d they come from?
You' re looking for my boy, are you?
- Yeah.
Would you like to share that information?
I don' t want you getting my boy into trouble.
He' s my only boy.
And he' s a good boy.
He' s coursing.
What' s coursing?
Hare coursing.
They set two lurchers -- They' re dogs, before you ask.
On a hare.
And the hare has to outrun the dogs.
So, what if it doesn' t?
Well, the big rabbit gets fucked, doesn' t it?
Proper fucked?
Yeah, Tommy.
Before "zee" Germans get there.
Do you know these tits, Errol?
I know a lot of tits...... but I don' t know any as fucking stupid as these two.
John?
I can' t help, guv.
Tyrone.
You silly, fat bastard.
- Do you want to do it?
- That depends.
On what?
On you buying this caravan.
Not the rouge one.
The rose.
- It' s not the same caravan.
- Not the same fight.
It' s twice the size of the last one.
The fight is twice the size.
And me ma needs a caravan.
I like to look after me ma.
It' s a fair deal.
Take it.
You' re lucky we aren' t worm food after your last performance.
Buying a tart' s mobile palace is a little fucking rich.
I wasn' t calling your mum a tart.
I just meant....
Save your breath for cooling your porridge.
Right.
And she' s terrible partial to the periwinkle blue.
Have I made myself clear?
Yeah, that' s perfectly clear, Mickey.
Just give me one minute to confer with my colleague.
Did you understand a word of what he said?
I' il tell you what.
Fucker.
I' il bet you for it.
You' il what?
He' il bet you for it.
What, like Tommy did last time?
Do me a favour?
I' il do you a favour.
lf I win, I get a caravan...... and the boys get a pair of them shoes.
lf I lose...... fuck it, I' il do the fight for free.
The last thing I really want to do is bet a pikey.
However, I don' t really have much of a choice.
Somehow I' ve got to get him to fight, but if I lose....
Well, I don' t even want to think about losing.
Okay.
I reckon the hare gets fucked.
What?
Proper fucked?
You got that, London?
We' re on!
I' il fucking tell you!
Get those off me.
I' il tell you who robbed your bookies.
Periwinkle blue.
Bye, boys.
Who' s proper fucked now, then?
There' s something very wrong with this.
It was us that wanted to buy a caravan off of him.
Well, why didn' t you "bust a cap in his ass" then, Tommy?
Mind you, you' d do more damage if you threw it at him.
What?
You saying I can' t shoot?
Oh, no, Tommy.
I wasn' t saying you can' t shoot.
I know you can' t shoot.
What we' re saying is, that piece of shit stuck in your trousers...... would do more damage if you fed it to him.
You saying the gun don' t work?
You tried it?
I want to see that sneaky fucking Russian.
Why' s he got a tea cosy on his head?
To keep his head warm.
- What happened to him?
- He got shot in the face.
I thought that was obvious.
What' d you do that for?
You mistake him for a rabbit?
- What do you want me to do?
- Sort it out.
- I' m not a witch doctor.
- But you are a bad boy yardie...... and bad boy yardies should know how to get rid of bodies.
I create the bodies, I don' t erase the bodies.
We' re in, governor.
Goody gumdrops.
Get us a cup of tea, would you, Errol?
Grab hold of his legs.
What do you think I' m gonna grab him by, his ears?
Hope this is not a bad moment.
Do you know who I am?
I do.
Good.
That will save me some time, then.
Well, I don' t.
You' re always gonna have problems lifting a body in one piece.
Apparently, the best thing to do...... is cut up a corpse into six pieces and pile it all together.
Would someone mind telling me, who are you?
When you got your six pieces, you gotta get rid of them.
It' s no good leaving it in the freezer for your mum to discover.
Then I hear the best thing to do is feed them to pigs.
You gotta starve the pigs for a few days...... then the chopped- up body will look like curry to a pisshead.
You gotta shave the heads of your victims and pull the teeth out...... for the piggies' digestion.
You could do this afterwards, of course...... but you don' t want to sieve through pigshit, do you?
You need at least 16 pigs to finish the job in one sitting...... so be wary of any man who keeps a pig farm.
They will go through a body that weighs 200 pounds...... in about eight minutes.
That means that a single pig...... can consume two pounds of uncooked flesh...... every minute.
Hence the expression...... "as greedy as a pig."
Well, thank you for that.
That' s a great weight off me mind.
Now, if you wouldn' t mind telling me who the fuck you are...... apart from someone who feeds people to pigs, of course.
Do you know what "nemesis" means?
"A righteous infliction of retribution...... manifested by an appropriate agent."
Personified, in this case, by a horrible cunt:
Me.
Gentlemen....
Why can' t you find me Franky, Doug?
Avi, what do you want me to do?
I' m not a bounty hunter.
What about Tony?
Bullet- Tooth Tony.
Who' s Bullet- Tooth --
- Tony!
- You silly fuck.
He' s a liability.
He' d find Moses and the burning bush.
You are gonna die, Tony!
He got shot six times, had the bullets moulded into gold.
I shoot you, you go down!
He has two in his teeth that Dad did, so he loves Dad.
Why don' t you fucking die?
- He' s the best chance you got.
- Six times?
ln one sitting.
You' re in trouble now.
Sounds promising.
What are we waiting for?
Bonjour.
What' s so fucking important?
Why do you think we' ve got a dead man...
-... missing an arm in our office?
- Talk to me, tell me.
I kid you not.
What do you think, Errol?
I think we should drip- dry them, while we got the chance.
It was a rhetorical question, Errol.
What have I told you about thinking?
- You got 48 hours.
- Yeah.
You can keep that silly, fat wanker.
The lads can' t lift him.
Forty- eight hours.
After that it' s your family...... and the pigs finish what the dogs don' t do.
So, what should I call you?
Should I call you "Bullet"?
"Tooth"?
Call me "Susan" if it makes you happy.
Tony, there is a man I' d like you to find.
That depends on all the elements in the equation.
How many are there?
Forty thousand.
Where was he last seen?
At a bookies.
Bookies?
Pass us the blower, Susi.
- Bookies got blagged last night.
- Blagged?
Speak English.
This country spawned the language, and nobody seems to speak it.
Blagged, robbed.
We' il see a man that may know something.
I need a gun.
You don' t, Rosebud, me old son.
You need me.
I got fucking black ink all over fuck boy.
He' s stained for fucking life.
That and the golden teeth as well.
Fucking hell --
All right, Mullet?
How you doing?
You all right, mate?
Nice tie.
I heard you weren' t about that much.
Still warm, the blood that courses through my veins.
Unlike yours, Mullet.
Who blagged Brick Top' s bookies?
- Do me a favour, Tone.
- I will do you a favour, Mullet.
I' il not bash the fuck out of you in front of all your girlfriends.
Gonna make it worth my while, mate?
Jesus, you know how it is, man.
Comfortable, Mullet?
It' s sadly ironic it' s that tie that' s got you into this pickle.
Now, you take all the time you want, mate.
What the fuck you doing, Tone?
Driving down the street with your head in my window.
- What you think I' m doing?
- Well, don' t, Tone.
You been using dog shit for toothpaste?
Slow down, Tone.
Slow down, Tony!
I don' t think so.
I think I' il speed up.
Play some music if you like.
I love this track.
I want to know who blagged Brick Top' s bookies.
Yes, Mullet?
I think it' s two black guys that work from a pawn shop in Smith Street.
Better not be telling me porky pies.
I tell you, it' s two black guys work out of a pawnshop on Smith Street.
It' s very effective, Tony.
It' s not too subtle, but effective.
Are we taking him with us?
It' s the Russian.
A Russian?
To be technical he' s an Uzbekistanian.
Uzbekistanian?
I' ve been dealing with those sneaky Russian dogs.
- Give me a name.
- Yurinov.
Boris.
- Boris The Blade?
- Yeah.
As in Boris The Bullet- Dodger?
Why do they call him The Bullet- Dodger?
Because he dodges bullets, Avi.
He won' t fight unless we buy his mum a caravan...... and you nicked all our savings.
ln the quiet words of the Virgin Mary, come again?
He' s a stubborn bastard.
He said he' s got to look after his mum.
- Are you taking the piss?
- What can I do?
I can' t make him do it, can l?
You' re not much good to me alive are you, Turkish?
He' s a useless shite, that boy.
Punish him for me, Errol.
I want that pikey to fight.
Brick Top thought smashing up our arcade...... might help me to persuade Mickey to fight.
And if that wasn' t enough...... he thought it would be a good idea...... to burn Mickey' s mum' s caravan.
While she was asleep in it.
Turkish, get your arse up.
You lot...... follow me and I' il fucking shoot you.
Calm down, son.
Behave yourself.
I' ve got the gun, son.
I think it' s you who should behave.
What?
You want to see if I' ve got the minerals?
Jesus.
Sorry, Mickey.
Did you do it?
Then what are you sorry for?
- What are you two doing here?
- Come back!
- You got some tars on you.
- Fuck off, Darren.
Fuck off!
How silly do I feel?
His mum is still smoking next to us...... and I' m asking him to fight.
I' il do the fight before he causes any more carnage.
And if he' d said no...... it could' ve been a shite sight worse.
Russians.
Russians.
I should' ve known.
Anti- Semite, slippery Cossack sluts.
What do you know about this goyim?
Ex- KGB cancer.
He was a highly trained undercover agent.
He' il be impossible to track down.
Yeah.
There' s a strange man who wants to sell us an 84- carat stone.
- Where' s he from?
- I don' t know.
Hard to tell.
He' s got a thick Russian accent.
Well, what was I supposed to do?
He set the dogs on me.
Look.
That sneaky fucking Russian!
No wonder he didn' t want to do it.
First things first.
One of us...... Tyrone, you go to the Russian' s.
The second you see him, call us.
Now.
He' s a right handful, this fella, so watch out.
I hate Russians.
I' il take care of him.
All yours, Rosebud, old son.
Not a problem.
Get me to a doctor.
Shoot that fuck!
Then, get me to a doctor.
Okay, but first we get the stone.
First the stone.
Then a doctor.
And not just any doctor, boychik.
A nice Jewish doctor.
Find my friend a nice Jewish doctor!
Get his keys and find out where the stone is.
- I think you got something to tell us.
- Take it easy, Rosebud.
Do you want him to be able to talk or not?
What the fuck do you mean, replicas?
They look the shit, don' t they?
And nobody is gonna argue.
I' ve got extra loud blanks, just in case.
ln case we have to deafen them to death?
- Yeah.
- Boris is here.
- We' re coming over.
Hold him there.
- Hold on!
He' s not on his own!
We' re off.
Very industrious for a Cossack.
Sneaky fucking Russian.
So, where is he?
It' s not just he.
Three fellas went in the house.
- They locked Boris in the car.
- Why didn' t you tell us that?
Did they look hard?
They looked messy.
- Let' s get out of here.
- What about the Russian?
I want you to bury him.
All right.
I think we should get you a new gun.
But this time, try it.
How far to the Russian' s?
Be there in a minute.
- Come on, then.
- No, no, not so fast, Vinny.
We can' t take them now.
We' re gonna have to follow them.
You shouldn' t drink that stuff, anyway.
Why?
What' s wrong with it?
- It' s not in sync with evolution.
- Shut up.
How do we get rid of him?
- Do you want to shoot him?
- It' s a little noisy.
- Do you want to stab him?
- That' s a little cold- blooded.
- Do you want to kill him or not?
I got a blade.
That' s the spirit.
Do they fire?
Of course they fire.
But how do you know?
They' re replicas.
What do you know about replicas?
What the fuck are you doing, Solomon?
You wanted to know whether they worked.
I didn' t mean try it in the car, Sol, you arsehole!
What are you gonna do with that, pick his teeth?
There' s a proper blade back there.
Cows have only been domesticated in the last 8000 years.
Before, they were running around mad as lorries.
The human digestive system hasn' t got used to any dairy products yet.
Well, fuck me, Tommy.
What have you been reading?
Let me do you a favour.
You.
Want a knife?
No, not me.
I wouldn' t know what to do.
What' s kept your fork company all these years?
The sharp side, the blunt side.
What do you want, a lesson?
ls that Boris?
Oh, Tyrone, what have you done?
What about Rosebud?
Well, you can bring him with you if you like.
But which bit would you like?
They' re getting out.
Get down and follow them.
Cover yourself up, Avi.
You' re making a scene.
I' m sorry for causing a scene, Tony.
Whoa, you are not taking that dog with you, Vince.
I can' t leave him in here, can l?
Pint of the black stuff, landlord.
I thought you wanted to get cleaned up.
Bathroom' s back there.
- He' s left the door open.
- Shouldn' t think that' s a good idea.
Should we go in?
I don' t want to go in there.
He' s a dangerous bastard.
Taken too many disco biscuits in the heat of Russian disputations.
He' s got as many of these nuts as he has those nuts.
I don' t care if he' s got fucking hazelnuts.
I want a gun that works, and I' m gonna tell him.
My God, Tommy, you certainly got those minerals.
Well, come on, then before "zee" Germans get here.
You just tell him who' s in charge.
Boris --
You certainly told him.
The Drowning Trout.
Come and pick us up.
And Doug...... sharpish.
I don' t want a fuss or to put a bullet in your face...... but unless you give me what I want there will be fucking murders.
What' s your name?
Shoot him.
Let go of the gun!
So, you' re obviously the big dick...... and that, on either side of you, are your balls.
There are two types of balls:
There are big brave balls, and there are little faggot balls.
These are your last words so make them a prayer.
Dicks have drive and clarity of vision...... but they' re not clever.
They smell pussy and they want a piece of the action.
And you thought you smelled some good old pussy...... and have brought your two little faggot balls along...... for a good old time.
But you' ve got your parties muddled up.
There' s no pussy here...... just a dose that' il make you wish you were born a woman.
Like a prick...... you' re having second thoughts.
You' re shrinking.
And your two little balls are shrinking with you.
The fact that you' ve got "Replica" written on the side of your gun...
... and the fact that I' ve got "Desert Eagle. 50"...... written on the side of mine...
... should precipitate...... your balls into shrinking, along with your presence.
Now...... fuck off.
Lock the door.
Lock it!
Give me the case.
Fuck you.
Shoot me.
I will.
I' il shoot you.
Pass me case or I shoot you.
You know what?
Fuck you too.
You' d be doing me a favour, you Russian fuck.
You!
Drop guns.
Fuck you!
You drop your gun!
Okay.
Avi...... pull your socks up!
- Tyrone?
- Fuck it.
We' re out of here.
Give me case.
Avi...
-... where' s the case?
- Put the gun away.
What' s Boris doing here?
Boris, what are you doing here?
Fuck you!
Where' s the case?
- You piece of crap.
- Don' t take the piss, Boris.
I' il show you.
Fuck you!
Almost had it.
For fuck' s sake.
Fuck you and all.
You lucky bastard.
Jeez, it' s flawless.
Don' t get attached to it.
It' s going to Brick Top.
Leave the dog here.
- Sol, why don' t we just leave?
- Because life' s too short, Vincent...... and it' il get a lot shorter if Brick Top wishes.
- Now leave that dog here.
- I' m gonna leave the dog here.
Don' t worry about it!
And if that pikey mutt does any damage, you' re gonna pay.
It' s okay.
Sit down.
Down.
I don' t want to go in there.
You' il never see me again.
Well, we won' t if you don' t.
Yeah?
All right.
Give me a minute.
It' s a bit fiddly.
Why is it down there?
Well, I put it down there in case we got mugged.
You ain' t from this planet, are you?
Who is gonna mug two black fellas holding pistols...... sat in a car that' s worth less than your shirt?
Bullet- Tooth Tony and his friend, Desert Eagle. 50.
What have they got to do with anything?
They' re both staring straight at me.
You should never underestimate the predictability of stupidity.
Now, out of the car.
And leave your water pistols behind.
Look, just tell him the stone' s back at the office.
I' il think of something.
Why' s he sweating?
Oh, never mind.
Tommy, why is your skin leaking?
- I' m a little worried, actually.
- Worried about what?
What happens if the gypsy knocks the other man out?
I mean, he' s done it before, hasn' t he?
We get murdered before we leave the building, and we get fed to the pigs.
I' m glad to see you' re climbing the walls in fucking anxiety.
Pardon my cynicism, but I don' t exactly trust the pikey.
Don' t think I haven' t thunk about that one.
It' s his mum' s funeral tonight.
God bless her.
You know those gypsies like a drink at a wake.
I' m not worried about whether Mickey knocks the other man out.
I' m worried about whether he makes it to the fourth round.
What ifhe doesn' t make it to the fourth round?
We get murdered before leaving the building...... and I imagine we get fed to the pigs.
So why are you so calm?
- I said -- - I heard what you said, Tommy!
It' s not as though we' ve got a choice, now, is it?
You show me how to control a wild fucking gypsy...... and I' il show you how to control an unhinged, pig- feeding gangster.
Bollocks!
I' m going for a walk.
Oh, that fucking dog!
Go on, get the dog.
- It' s a bit funky in here, isn' t it?
- Open a window.
You people live like animals.
Now, where' s the stone?
- Come on, where is it?
- It' s over here.
- Where?
Where?
- I left it in a box.
It' s empty.
I' m getting heartburn.
Tony, do something terrible.
No, I' m being serious!
The dog.
The dog must have had it.
Now then, let' s have a look, shall we?
Tony.
- What?
- Look in the dog.
- You mean, "look in the dog"?
- I mean, open him up.
It' s not a tin of baked beans.
What do you mean, open him up?
You know what I mean.
That' s a bit strong.
I don' t know about this.
No, you can' t do this.
It' s fucking squeaking!
You never heard a dog squeak before?
Give me that goddamn gun!
I' m shooting the dog!
Shoot the fucking dog!
You sneaky fucking bastard.
Thank God for that.
I hate fucking dogs!
Come on, Tony.
Tony, come on!
Tony?
- Yeah.
Don' t go to England.
That dog is gonna go back to the campsite.
It always does.
How' s the dog gonna find the campsite?
Have you smelled the campsite, Sol?
All right.
But we have to wait until it gets light.
And we have to get rid of these bodies.
That one with the tea cosy on his head' s starting to stink.
Right.
Let' s stick them in the car, and then go and look for a pig farm.
Mickey.
Mickey!
You feeling all right, Mickey?
Need a drink.
You can' t give him a drink!
It' s not for him.
It' s for me.
Ah, mates.
Amen.
He' s a hard bastard, this Good Night Anderson, so pay attention.
All right, Mickey?
Mickey!
Need to have a shite!
lf you see the pikey, Turkish or his girlfriend come out before me...... shoot the bastards.
Well, come on.
We got a fight to go to.
All right, Tom.
- Hope we get a better show this time.
- This will make up for it.
Mickey' s going down in the fourth.
Terry over there is in charge of the bets.
Now, you have to forgive me.
I' il forgive you if he goes down this time.
- Our lads at the campsite?
- They' re over there now.
I fucking hate pikeys.
- How long have we gotta stay here?
- As long as it takes.
Now, shut up.
Fucking hate pikeys.
ls he fucking stoned?
He' s like that before a fight.
Do you know when you' re going down?
Of course he knows when he' s going down.
Fuck- face, who' s speaking to you?
He asked him, didn' t he?
Fuck- face?
I like that one, Errol.
I' il remember that next time I climb off your mum.
- Not now.
- Gonna be a tragedy of a fight.
Be a nice one.
Hell of a way to be a war.
And there none a yours.
There' s a camp full of pikeys that might not think you' re so funny.
Not when they' re putting out flames on their children' s backs.
Now get up and have a fucking fight.
Three rounds and you' re a vegetable, aren' t you, pikey!
I' m in charge here.
No fucking about, no eye- gouging.
Do your worst.
Let' s get it on!
What the fuck' s going on?
You gonna finish him or what?
Talk about saved by the bell.
Do you understand the consequences of knocking that man out?
Do not knock him out, Mickey.
All right, let' s break it up.
What, is he fucking deaf?
What is he doing?
Come on and sit.
What the fuck are you doing, Mickey?
You' re dancing like a fairy.
They' il hang us if they think it' s rigged.
Get out there and hurt him.
But for fuck' s sake, do not knock him out.
All he' s got to do is stay down.
Now, we are fucked.
He can' t stand up.
We' re out of here.
Stupid pikey knows Brick Top' s got keen- to- kill monkeys with shotguns...... sitting outside his campsite.
Once the campsite' s wiped out, I know it' s gonna be the same for us.
Ever cross the road and look the wrong way?
Give me that fucking shooter!
And, hey, presto, there' s a car nearly on you.
So, what do you do?
Something very silly.
You freeze.
And your life doesn' t flash before you...... because you' re too scared to think.
Youjust freeze and pull a stupid face.
But the pikey didn' t.
Why?
Because he had plans on running the car over.
It had previously occurred to me...... that he' d taken the demise of his mother rather lightly.
For every action, there is a reaction.
And a pikey reaction...... is quite a fucking thing.
Pete, talk to me.
lf you want your friend to hear you, talk a lot louder than that.
- Give me that fucking shooter.
- I' il give you your shooter, you cunt.
That is when I thought the pikey had money riding on himself.
That' s why the bastard never goes down when he' s supposed to.
We' ve been tucked up...... while he' s been cleaning up.
We' re worse off now than when we started.
The next day we went to the campsite...... but the gypsies had disappeared during the night.
Which was probably a good thing...... considering they' d just buried 12 people somewhere in the area.
Where is he?
He ain' t fucking here, that' s for sure.
We can' t ask a man to fight for us if we can' t find him, can we?
You won' t find a pikey that doesn' t want to be found.
He could be in a campsite in Kampu- fucking- chea by now.
Bollocks!
Come on.
- What you doing here?
- What' s it got to do with you?
So, what you doing here?
I' m taking the dog for a walk.
What' s the problem?
What' s in the car?
Seats and a steering wheel.
What do you know about gypsies?
I know they' re not to be trusted.
All right, get your dog.
On your way.
Get the dog, Tommy.
The dog.
All right, boy.
Come on.
Come on, Daisy.
No, Daisy!
He loves that dog.
Always playing silly games.
Stop messing about and get it in the car.
Tommy!
Good boy.
Good boy.
Good boy, Daisy, good boy.
Could you tell me...... why you got a dead man with an arm missing in your boot?
Hey, George...... is that a tea cosy on his head?
Oh, you love a dog, don' t you, Tommy?
Tommy persuaded me to keep the dog.
I eventually agreed, as long as he took it to a vet.
I couldn' t stand that squeaking anymore.
The vet found halfan undigested shoe, a squeaky toy...... and an 84- carat diamond lodged in its stomach.
It' s quite amazing what can happen in a week.
Still didn' t shut it up, though.
So, what do you do?
You go see the man that knows about these sort of things.
So, what do you think?
Do you know anyone who' d be interested?
I might.

Oh, uh, yeah.
Two cups for me, too.
0- 55, 0- 5- 5.
I got my reasons for doing this.
Well, that' s nice.
- See, not too long ago, my life was goin 'along Just fine.
Mm- hmm.
Well, maybe I wasn' t happy, but, y' know, I was content.
I had a Job, I had friends...
I had a house...
I had everything but --
That steady bang, huh?
"She," the squeeze, the girlfriend -- whatever you wanna call a chick.
Yeah, right.
And then I met her....
This whole thing started one night at McCools
The place was packed, even my cousin Carl was there, and I was in the zone
Everybodys got their power base -- pouring drinks is my speciality
I was puttin on quite a show for the frat boys at the end of the bar
Awright, who wants to take the plunge?
I want it!
Randy:
Awright, folks, let' s go, wrapit up.
- What a setup!
You must get laid like... all the time.
- Oh, yeah.
Fuck, I knew it!
They Just can' t resist a man working for tips in the service industry.
Gimme, gimme, gimme...
Haaa!!!
Well, that would be a good idea, except they' re visiting Grandma in Ohio.
What about that thing called a Job?
Close.
You must mean Ragsdale, Hersch & Klein.
Take a card, young man, because you never know.
Oh!
What are you tryin 'to do, you tryin' to get rid of me?
Hey!
Let' s go to one of those after hours clubs.
They got these long, long - legged girls there, you can look at them and maybe touch them.
I gotta close up.
You think Just 'cause I' m married
I don' t know about these places?
Just because you are married means you' re gettin 'it a whole lot more than me.
That' s a depressing thought.
Carl, you need me to call you a cab?
Oh, no... you Just sobered me uppretty good.
Get home safe.
Where are you going?!
Man:
Do you hear what I' m tellin 'ya?!
Don' t touch me!!!
Get over here!!!
Let go of me!!!
Hey!
Driver:
Fuck you!!!
And there she was...
This is not the kind of girl you usually run into In a dark alley
I ever run into
You okay?
Girl: No, I' m not okay.
Some smelly guy Just tried to rape me.
- What a Jerk!
Here.
You want me to call the police?
I- I know you' re Just trying to help, but spending the rest of the night with a bunch of ass hole cops isn' t exactly what I need right now.
Your...
Thanks.
Huh?
No, sorry.
This really is my night.
I bet I could find you one in the bar.
It' s okay.
I' m tryin 'to cut down anyway.
You' re gonna be okay?
Okay, alright.
Hey!
What are you doin 'right now?
- Whaddya mean?
I Just had this little unpleasant experience, and I don' t especially feel like being by myself.
Right, right.
Well, I was Just gonna go home.
You got a stereo?
Well, I got a boom box.
Only one of the speakers is workin ', so...
I don' t know if you call it a stereo.
Where' s your car?
Actually, I Just live a couple of blocks --
- Sorry.
Hey.
So, do you live in a house or an apartment?
Well, this is it.
You live here alone?
It was my mother' s before she died.
Yeah.
Oh, you' re so lucky.
I' ve always dreamt of having my own place.
I know what you' re thinking --
The police station might be cheerier, huh?
Yeah.
Lot of potential.
"A lot of potential."
What is she, a real estate agent?
I got beer,
Uh...
I may have a Yoo- Hoo.
- Beer sounds good.
I drank the last one this morning.
Uh, I can make some tea or, uh, coffee...
That' s fine, thanks.
Well, tea, anyway.
Maybe some ice?
Ah...
Sorry, no, uh, no ice.
My freezer' s on the blink.
What?
Fine.
I love it.
It' s actually my second favorite thing in the world.
Really?
And what' s your first favorite?
Fucking.
What?!
It' s my mom' s room.
# The way you move your sexy body #
# It makes me want to get to know you #
# The way you move #
# A little bit better #
# Like a game of darts #
# I' m so into you I can feel ya groove #
# Don' t hold back Just make your move #
A woman after my own heart -- heh- heh.
I don' t think of myself as the kind of person who' s in this kind of office.
It started one night at McCool' s...
Hey!
Who wants to take the plunge?
Karen had taken the kids to Ohio to visit her mom
So I decided to dropin on my cousin, who I hadn' t seen in a long time
We re talking about an adult who thinks it' s fun to drink out of a toilet plunger.
I mean, this is the mentality we' re dealing with here.
Right.
The woman, okay
Well, I look across the room and I saw
... a very beautiful woman.
I hung around hoping shed come back, but she didn t
Okay, time for me to go.
It was pretty late, and I d had a few drinks
Girl:
I' m Just a little bit nervous.
How do I look?
She was with this guy, and I thought maybe this is not the best time to hit on this particular woman
What is this, PMS week?
So I got in my car and
I don' t know, I started to doze off a little, and I hear all this screaming and cursing.
Don' t touch me, asshole!
Bartender:
Driver:
Fuck you!
And you didn' t try to help?
Oh, I would have.
But?
I may have fallen asleep.
I was practically forced into this.
Jewel?
Jewel?
If i tell you that was really amazing?
I know it was.
That' s the problem.
To tell ya the truth...
I only took one psychology course in Junior college,
I know there' s supposed to be this thing where you' re sad or you' re guilty after...
Well, I personally don' t suffer from that.
It' s not that.
Don' t you see?
That guy tonight --
Oh -- oh, that creep in the firebird?
I know that guy.
Of course you know the guy.
Let' s face it, you' re not the type of girl who Just Jumps into a car with some smelly guy that you don' t even know,
I know that.
No....
He and I are... doing this... thing.
Oh, shit, I really like you.
What do you mean by "thing"?
He and I get in this fight, and then you or whoever comes to my rescue and takes me home, and then...
He like shows up and we rob you.
What?
I mean, do you believe that?
I' m shocked.
I- I take it this is something that you- you' ve done before?
Just a couple of times.
I know it sounds sick, but you don' t know Utah, he' s nuts.
How does he know where we are, anyway?
I' m supposed to call him and tell him.
You- you haven' t done that yet, have you?
Of course not!
Oh, good.
Good...
I got it.
Don' t call him.
Let' s call the police instead.
Not if you ever want to see me again.
Oh, right.
Y' know, I generally think better with my shoes on, so...
This guy Utah, is he a mormon?
Uh, I wouldn' t say that.
You know, this guy...
He sounds like a ma Jor piece of shit, you know?
You wouldn' t be talkin 'about me, would ya, loverboy?
Wh- why didn' t you call?
I was Just about to.
Has this guy got anything worth takin '?
Old TV, a VCR.
He' s got a boom box, but only one speaker works.
Telephone, um...
Oh yeah, and one light hooked upto the clapper.
Hey, that was my mom' s.
Shut your fuckin 'mouth!
You stand there, you call me a piece of shit!
I' m the piece of shit?
I' m here with my lady, you understand?
It is a touchy situation!
Has he got a car?
No.
No?
He' s pathetic!
You- you don' t got a car?
Everybody' s got a car today --
Even bums don' t not got a car!
What do you do when you take a chick out, you go on a bus?
Think you' re gonna get laid on a bus?
Think you' re gonna give some chick the fuckin 'monster on a bus?
I got a car...
The "piece of shit' s" got a car!
What about Jewelry, has he got Jewelry?
Just a Swatch
Oh yeah?
Take it off.
C' mon, you' re so slow.
It' s right over here.
Awright, you' re up, slugger, let' s go.
You want me to open it?
No, I want you to dance with it --
Okay.
And if there' s a gun in there, Just leave it.
'Cause you' il pull it out, you' il get nervous, you' il wind upmiss in' me, then I gotta do what I gotta do with what I got.
Look at me when I talk to you!
I can' t look at you and look at the safe at the same time.
Oh, excuse me, okay.
You' re the big- shot now, I' m nobody, right?
Okay, I' m over here now.
Excuse me.
Got any other features on this watch?
It' s got a stopwatch.
It' s got a stopwatch?
I never figured out how to use it.
Oh....
What happened?
He was gonna kill you.
Really?
I mean, he was Just --
He could definitely tell that there was something going on between us, y' know?
How?
Because I' ve never actually slept with any of the other guys that I' ve done this with before, that' s how.
Is he dead?
Oh, Jesus.
Do you hate me now?
No, no, no, no.
Oh yes, you do!
No, it' s not that, okay?
It' s Just the sex and the violence all in one night, it' s a little much.
- What?
- What are we gonna do now?!
- I don' t know!
Well, think of something!
That' s a good idea.
- Yeah?
And what are we gonna tell 'em?
We' il tell them the truth,
I mean, that he was robbing you and- and I shot him, and that' s that.
Yeah.
Tell 'em the truth.
I like that.
Uh, since he was threatening you,
And with good behavior
-- I could be out in seven... years.
- Let' s come upwith another plan.
- What?
I mean, that he was robbing you and somebody else shot him?
Who?
Well, we could say that I shot him.
That won' t work.
It' s ridiculous, it would never work that way, it' s --
Well, maybe...
Well, I mean, let' s...
Okay.
- Yes.
- Mm- hmm.
So that' s two out of three.
What' s that, that' s sixty- seven percent true,
I mean, that' s pretty good these days, right?
Right.
That' s some first date, killin 'her boyfriend.
Well, it gave the relationship a certain intensity.
It all started one night at McCools
Earl Raymond Pitts.
He was born in Dwight Correctional.
His mother had twins while she was doin 'a bit for narcotics.
You mean there' s another one out there like him?
Yeah.
He went by the name "Utah."
Yeah.
Don' t ask me.
I' m a little unclear on this.
He was holding a gun on you,
But you were able to get your gun and shoot him point- blank in the back of the head?
Yeah, right.
It- it all happened kinda fast.
So... he was standing in front of you, and then... what?
He heard something?
Right.
He turned around, you grabbed your gun...
Right.
Which was where?
Uh...
- Hidden next to the safe?
- Right.
He turned around, you grabbed your gun, and pow!
About what time was this?
About what time was this?
Just before I called 911.
Thanks.
It' s res ponsible citizens Just like yourself that make my Job a lot easier.
You can imagine my mood, getting roused from a sound sleep to go scoopsome citizen off a barroom floor
His.
Does she have anything to do with it?
Nah, she was waitin 'for him back at their house, he didn' t show, she got worried, came here lookin' for him.
Awright.
You' re free to go, miss.
Suddenly my whole life changed
Like Theresa had come back from the dead
She even looks a little like Theresa.
So this girl, she' s good in the sack, huh?
I' m sorry, man, you get my age, you like to hear about the old un!
Sorry.
Nice ass?
Mr. Chick Fife, telephone call.
Mr. Chick Fife, please call your cardiologist.
You takin 'the rap for the shooting musta worked out okay.
Your boss, he musta treated you like a hero.
Oh, kid....
I can' t have people comin 'in here
lokin 'for a good time, seein' you and thinkin ',
"that put a bullet in the guy' s head.
"my strawberry daiquiri and onion rings,
Joey, the guy was tryin 'to rob your bar.
He didn' t take nothin '!
You put a bullet in his friggin 'noggin!
You' re gone!
Hello!
Wh- what are you doin '?
What does it look like?
We' re not there yet, are we?
We' re movin 'a little fast here, Jewel.
- Yeah?
Need your signature.
- What' s this?
- 1- 800- Mattress.
I didn' t order any mattress.
Dammit!
How are we supposed to pay for this stuff?!
God, Randy, I Just thought we really had something, or at least the start of something.
But obviously I' m incredibly stupid.
You' re not stupid.
I' il be out of your life in Just a few minutes.
I didn' t say I wanted you out of my life.
Ha!
Further down the line than all the sex we' ve been having?
Any further down the line than killing Utah together?
You' re right... you know what, it' s me.
I lost my Job today.
You what?
I got canned.
Oh, baby, why didn' t you say so?
Aw... are you okay?
I guess.
Mmm....
The lawyer.
We' re going over to his house on Saturday for a barbecue.
So Carl invites me over to his house for a barbecue.
Now, Carl never invites me over, so I' m thinkin 'to myself, why now?
Here you go.
That' s sweet.
Thanks.
Ha ha ha!
I meant that in a good way.
You bangin 'her?
She must have fucked you senseless when she found out you shot a guy?
Because I read that women cream for the violence.
I don' t know what that is.
When you' re fuckin 'her, though, because she' s so young, is it --
I mean, look at her!
It' s like havin 'a porn star in my house!
Except she' s makin 'salad.
You have such a beautiful house -- it' s so homey.
That' s all Karen, believe me.
I wanted to go with lots of stainless steel, something we could Just pssh!
Hose it right off.
Thank you, Jewel.
It' s always been my dream to have a real nice house.
I already know exactly what it' il look like --
Wall- to- wall carpeting with matching drapes, and a big, fluffy white couch, nice dining room set, and in the corner... a fountain.
It' s gonna be...
It' s gonna be great.
I didn' t Just make it up, I saw it in a magazine.
Better Homes and Fountains?
Carl!
Hey, Randy, you got a fountain in your place, don' t ya?
In the living room --
Oh no, that' s a leaky toilet.
You know what, Carl?
You' re not funny -- Just rude.
- Let' s get together some time.
- That' s a good idea.
Hey, c' mon.
Okay, okay!
Okay.
Why don' t you let Carl run you home?
No, I' m afraid that' s where your luck runs out.
I can' t drive, I' ve been drinkin '.
One of these days.
Make him buy a car, would ya?
Let' s go catch that 4: 15 bus,
Let' s get the hell out of here.
I wish he hadn t put that idea in her head
What' s this?
Oh, a friend of mine' s goin 'away for a little while...
So she said I could borrow it.
We' re gonna be used to havin 'a car by then.
- Then we' re gonna have to buy one.
- So?
It' s a bottomless pit of expenses!
You got in surance, you got repairs, car payments --
You' re Just afraid because now you don' t have an excuse for not finding work, aren' t you?
Stopright there, this has nothing to do with work.
Did you know it' s safer to fly than it is to drive a car?
Because I didn' t bring you home a plane?
I' m gonna be out there with a hose and a bucket of suds to wash the damnthing, you can forget it -- I' m not that guy.
Well, fine.
I' il wash the car.
God, you' re full of shit.
I' m full of shit?
Yes.
Lemme tell ya -- I have seen people
leave the bar so drunk they can' t even see, and off they speed in their giant sports utility vehicles.
Well, you run into one of these guys out on the street, and you' re gonna die, and you' re gonna die ugly!
Would you relax?
Christ, look at this house!
I come at a bad time?
Uh, no.
And then that damndetective dropped in
As if i wasn t stressed- out enough
I' il let you two talk.
Oh, you know, he' s a cop.
After that night at McCool' s I was a mess.
I couldn' t concentrate...
I could barely eat.
Nothin 'deep- fried, anyway.
I had this longing...
Something inside of me said I had to see that woman again
Boy, was I glad I got there at that exact moment
You' re gonna die, and you' re gonna die ugly!
It was like I had been chosen for a very special assignment
Not by the department, but by a higher power
Oh...
Did I... come at a bad time?
Uh, no.
Didn' t seem possible, but she was even more beautiful than the night I first saw her.
And I said, Good afternoon, then she said, I Il let you two talk
Then he said --
Not bad, huh?
There was something about him I Just didn' t like.
According to your statement, you closed the bar at one- thirty.
You didn' t call to report the shooting until three- fifty- eight.
I need to know what you were doing during that time frame.
Haven' t we already gone over all this stuff, man?
Hey, uh, Jewel, how about crackin 'me open a brew, huh?
I don' t know, it was, uh,
I had to count all that money,
It was a busy- ass night, awright?
I think on this night we had those frat boys in there, and a couple of 'em --
Whoa, whoa -- whaddya doin '?
This guy' s a cop.
He can' t drink, he' s on the Job!
Why don' t ya do somethin ', y' know, make yourself useful.
All right.
I' il be outside -- was hing the car.
Yeah, you do that.
Man, I' m sorry about her.
A couple of 'em ended upin the bathroom and barfin' up all over the floor...
I wasn' t listening to a word he was saying
I felt so guilty,
like I was betraying the memory of Theresa but I couldn t take my eyes off her
# To get ready #
# To realize Just what I have found #
# Of what I am #
# It' s all clear to me now #
# My soul' s like a wheel that' s turning #
# Yeah yeah yeah #
Can you imagine how i felt?
You should see what she does with my hose.
I don' t know what would make me invite him over for barbecue.
Hmm?
Yeah, but --
I say a lot of things.
Why do you think you did?
I don' t know.
You tell me.
Carl:
You know, he brings her and shes wearing this nothing of a dress, its a slip!
I mean, you can see everything
For a barbecue.
No, no, wait a second, what am I thinking?
Hot pants.
They re like cupping everything, and- and this top --
You could definitely see her stomach
Wait!
No, no no -- sorry, it was a dress.
It was a dress, like a, like a summer kind of farmer girl dress, you know?
With like, cherries and plums and --
- little fruits.
That' s fine, thank you.
She' s so sexy, but pretty!
- Okay, all right!
- No!
All right!
That' s enough!
I get the picture!
So then --
In any case, the reason I called you was you' re one guy I can trust in a situation like this.
I got a guy with a hole in the back of his head where the exit wound was...
Um, would anybody care for another burger?
If you have one.
And then she grabs me and she says,
Lets get together sometime
So she was coming on to you?
Yeah.
It doesn' t surprise me, really.
It doesn' t.
No, 'cause --
I mean, I don' t mean to sound full of myself, but...
But what?
You' re irresistible?
Women... women find me attractive.
Do you think I' m attracted to you?
But even so,
I think I felt something when I walked in the office.
It' s okay, don' t worry about it.
You don' t wanna hear about all this.
No, no, no -- go on, go on.
You got the car, you' re feelin 'good about yourself again, and boom!
The sex picks up again, right?
Well, not exactly.
I was watchin a lot of cable
- Randy!
Randy.
Can we talk?
What did you do all day?
Maria Marushka
It' s really good.
Randy..
I think not having a Job is starting to get to you.
No.
It' s not having any money that' s starting to get to me.
Well, that is why I think we need to talk.
With what they pay me at the store we can barely cover our bills, not to mention the new dinette set I want, or the window treatments I want in this room.
Well, I' m sorry, there' s not much more I can do.
I mean, nobody seems to be hiring.
What!
You didn' t go down there and- and beg him to give me my Job back!
Good.
- What?
Wait a minute!
Why are you doing this?
I' m doing this for us as a couple, Randy.
And more importantly, I' m doing this for you and your sense of self- worth.
I think that you have a lot of anger towards Joey, and that because of that, you feel less of a man because of his power to take away your livelihood.
You think i' m gonna have less anger and feel like more of a man if you start dating this guy?!
No.
I' m suggesting that tomorrow night when you know he' s at the concert, you go to his house and you steal everything of value you can fit into our car.
You' re Joking.
I mean, come on, the guy fired you.
And he still owes you six hours overtime, right?
I Just don' t think he knows what he had with you.
You' re the best bartender I' ve ever seen, by far.
You know, the way you worked those crowds, you really had 'em in the palm of your hand.
You know what you reminded me of?
What?
A rock star.
Really.
I don' t know...
I Just...
I don' t see myself doing something like that.
It' s crazy.
Once we fence all his stuff, we' il make a pretty nice chunk of change.
Look, forget it!
There' s no way.
Absolutely not.
But you did it, of course.
Yeah, I did it.
I knew Joey would have A big CD collection
And I was surprised at all the other cool stuff he had
You know, Jewel must have taken a few more psychology courses than me, because as crazy as I thought the whole idea was, as reluctant as I was to do it, by the end of the evening, I felt great
Yeah.
# I got money in my pocket #
# And I really Just don' t care #
# I Just want to live my life #
# 'Cause you know that I believe #
Jewel?
The Indian stays.
Randy:
For a while there, we almost seemed like a normal couple
Burmeister:
Yeah.
What are you doing?
Oh, nothing.
Ah- ah- ah.
Randy, come on, we have to throw some things away.
But not my Sno- Globes, come on!
Can' t we Just compromise and throw one Sno- Globe away?
Jewel, these came from my mom.
She brought it back from Chicago.
See, it' s got the Sears Tower here, and this one here is very special.
Ya see, my mom used to say that this was our house, and as long as I never broke it, we' d always have a place to stay.
I knew s he was only Joking, but still...
You' re a sick puppy, man.
So what kind of Job do you have at this point?
I hadn' t got one yet.
It was sort of an ongoing problem between us.
I- 29, I- 2- 9.
I was offered the lunch shift at TGl- Friday' s...
You lucky stiff.
I actually thought it was kind of a stepdown from unemployment, I mean...
No, you got it, you won -- I- 29.
Uh, bingo.
We have a winner!
I gotta be honest with you, my young friend.
I' m leaning towards the girl on this one,
I mean, she' s made your dump nice and livable, you' re gettin 'good action on the mattress...
Bingo person:
Hold onto it till you cash out.
Least you could do is make some money.
Maybe you should be playin 'bingo.
That' s why... we decided to do another... you know, break- in.
What do you mean, "we"?
Yeah, Jewel and me,
I mean, I' m no criminal.
I bet he' s got a DVD.
I' d love to have one of those.
We' re going to Montague' s, so I borrowed something from the designer section at the store.
I Just think you might have overshot,
I mean, even for Montague' s.
Really?
Yeah.
You know...... maybe we shouldn' t be doing this.
- Yeah.
- Oh, Randy!
Joey' s is one thing, but this is something else.
Would you be happier if we weren' t?
Sure, wouldn' t you?
I' il show you what makes me happy.
These are all pictures from magazines, things I' ve saved.
Things that I want in my house someday.
I' ve been carrying this thing around with me for years.
Whenever I feel lonely or get depressed,
I Just add in a new couch or a new set of drapes and...
I don' t know, Just dream.
It makes me happy to think that someday
I might actually live in the kind of house that looks like it belongs in a magazine.
You want me to be happy, don' t you, Randy?
Of course I do.
So who was it this time?
Just some guy --
They were going to some fancy restaurant, Montagues
Jewel was sure she could keephim there for at least three hours
It was a good thing, too, because it was gonna take a little time to clean this guy out -- he had everything
At first I couldn' t find his DVD player, and I really needed to, since Jewel wanted one
So I went upstairs, and there it was
DVD!
Bingo!
Him again?!
Bingo lady:
Not to worry, that was a false alarm.
Sorry.
It was like some game show where they send you on a shopping spree
I found a nice new Rolex -- much nicer than my old Swatch.
Unfortunately, this guy was I guess a midget
And then things started goin wrong
What' s this?
This is the place where it all happens, baby.
Come on.
Mi casa, es su casa
I thought we were going out somewhere!
Why go out, baby?
We got it all right here!
Best sound system you ever heard, a little hot tub, swimming pool...
The Gregster might even break out his secret stash of blow.
Uh, Greg...
Uh, I thought, uh...
Jewel:
Greg?
Oh, shit!
Greg?
Greg!!!
Randy!
This is a nice house.
Too bad you' re such a shit.
Heh!
A little dirty- talker.
Okay, okay, come on, let' s talk.
I have a better idea, baby.
Bitch!
Get off me!
Ha ha!
You like it a little rough, huh?
Oh, yeah, you wanna play?
Ungh!
Oh, my God, I don' t believe this.
Everywhere you go, there' s a dead guy.
Take the DVD.
Take the DVD!
I' m not takin 'the DVD.
Why not?
Well, I don' t know, it Just does n' t seem right.
It was all right before?
Before there wasn' t a dead guy Iyin 'on the floor.
Y' know, I never saw a dead person till i met you.
The guy was trying to rape me, does that mean anything to you?
Now take the DVD!
I' m not takin 'the DVD!
Don' t you want to live in the type of house that has a first- rate home entertainment center, including a DVD?
I already got his big- screen.
'Cause the big- screen is already down in the car.
I get all dressed up,
I get a friggin 'shiner,
Randy:
I didn' t care about the TV,
I was Just doin this to make Jewel happy
But you didn' t take the DVD.
A local attorney was found slain this morning...
I do not believe we were in that gazillion- dollar house and we didn' t end up with a thing.
Did you forget about the dead guy on the floor?
No, I did not forget about the dead guy on the floor, but we' re not talking about him right now, we' re talking about the dead guy on the floor' s stuff, and he had a lot of stuff, stuff we could have taken if you weren' t such a chickens hit.
What' s that?
So now I' m a chicken shit, is that it?
Yes, I believe that' s the technical term for what you are.
Yeah, well, I' d rather be a chicken shit than whatever the hell is it that you are.
I' m the woman living with the chicken shit.
Not for long.
Yeah, not for long, that' s right, because I need a real man, someone I can count on, not a chicken shit like you.
TV:
Thus far, police have no leads...
It' s that cop!
Aren' t you glad we don' t have a lot of stolen stuff Iyin 'around now?
You' re a genius.
- Hi.
- Morning.
Thought you' d wanna know we closed the investigation on the shooting at McCool' s, no charges will be filed.
Thanks.
Everything okay, ma' am?
Sure.
Those are some pretty nasty bruises.
Huh?
Oh yeah, she -- had an accident.
Accident?
Would you mind if I talk to her for a minute?
Alone?
Okay.
At the time, I was glad Jewel was gonna talk to him
She knew how to handle the cops, what to say to get rid of em
She was good that way
Whatever happened in there, she doesn' t want to talk about it.
What domestic violence?!
I will go to a Judge who will issue a restraining order which means you are not allowed on this property --
This is my house!
Or within 100 yards of your wife until this matter is settled.
She' s not my wife!
That' s too bad -- you' d have more rights if she were.
You expect me to Just walk away?
If you don' t, I' m afraid I' m gonna have to arrest you.
You can' t be serious!
This -- this -- can' t I Just talk to her?
I don' t think that would be wise at this time, sir.
Whatever she told you, she' s -- she --
It' s not true, y' know, okay?
Hey, Jewel, honey, could you come out here, please?
Hun!
Jewel!
Would you be kind enough to tell the police officer that I didn' t hit you!
Would you please tell the officer that I didn' t do anything to you?
Don' t make me use force, sir.
Jewel!
Jewel!
I couldn' t believe it
I was so pissed at her I thought I was gonna explode
Well, I gotta admit, she' s not perfect.
Charlie:
She' s like this pure, delicate flower,
I Just wanted to protect her.
- But, uh, she was living with another man.
- That piece of slime? he didn' t deserve her.
And you did?
I don' t know.
Oh, Charlie.
I was totally cons umed by her.
My every thought was of her.
I was walkin 'around in a haze.
People talked to me, but I didn' t hear what they were saying
A lawyer at Ragsdale, Hersch & Klein.
- What did he do?
"Do"?
Lawyer.
Ragsdale, Hersch & Klein.
- It doesn' t make sense.
Why would you go to all the trouble of stealing a big- screen TV and leave a DVD behind?
Poor guy
The only thing goin through my head was her
Everything okay, ma' am?
Sure.
Those are some pretty nasty bruises.
Would you mind if I spoke to her for a minute?
Knock yourself out.
Charlie, what is it?
Why would God fill me with this desire
Sometimes some time apart is the best thing.
I could arrange that.
Would I get to stay in the house?
A temporary restraining order would keephim way for... 90 days.
But permanently?
You' d have to get a lawyer.
Do you know one?
Yeah.
I know one.
She called you?
Yes -- I didn' t call her.
She tells me things are going badly with Randy, so I thought maybe I could helpher out and introduce her to one of the guys in my office.
In fact, I did, I once introduced her to this other attorney,
Greg, who' s this...... guy who was murdered.
Anyway, she Just knew that Karen and I were having problems.
Were you?
Yes, you could say that.
Sexual problems?
Hey, you know...
Okay, if you want to label it, yeah.
But I' m not saying it' s Karen' s fault.
Was it your fault?
Maybe it was Karen' s fault.
Was there sex between you and this woman?
Yes.
You want it now, lawyer boy?
Yes, please!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
What happened there?
What?
Anything at all -- anything!
Um- hmm, um- hmm.
I' m gonna need some legal advice soon.
You got it.
- You got it.
You like it?
Can you helpme?
Anything!
- Say it!
I will give you legal advice.
- I will give you legal advice!
- Say... it!!!
Yeah?
- Whooah!
- Yes.
With a whip?
- Yes.
And you en Joyed it?
Yes.
Hello.
Hi.
I looked for any excuse to go see her
I spoke to a friend of mine about helping you with keeping the house.
Oh, good.
Thanks.
I, uh, I Just wish I had known a bit sooner.
See, I already sort of contacted this other lawyer.
Well, if you' d rather use him --
Well, lawyers --
They' il always try to find a way to screw you.
Yeah.
Well, I- I better --
I, uh -- - Yeah?
I was making some supper...
If you' d like to...
It' s nothing special.
Surely this was the hand of God.
How do you mean, Charlie?
In an instant I was transformed from a broken man, made whole.
It was like Theresa had been brought back to me
The way she moved,
# Her face cut from stone #
Can I helpyou with that?
- No thanks.
I' il be right back.
She even made linguini with tomatoes and onions
like Theresa used to
Jeez.
What' s that?
Oh -- Nothing.
Probably Just a cat got into the garbage.
Bread?
- Thanks.
How come you never wear a uniform?
I' m a detective.
Sometimes I do, it depends.
I bet you look real good in it.
I couldn' t wipe the goofy smile off my face
I was so happy
Because of her I lost my Job,
I lost my house,
I' m an accessory in not only one, but two murders.
Randy:
I couldn' t stopthinking about her
Okay, maybe I wasn t allowed on the property, but that didn' t mean I couldn t keepan eye on her
And then she did something that sent me over the edge
I knew I had to do something something drastic to salvage what little I had left
I got the ten thousand.
Bingo parlor, right?
Burmeister:
I say, "It looks like we might get some rain"...
We came upwith a code.
I said, "Looks like we might get some rain" --
Yeah, yeah, I know this part.
Yeah, right.
You slept with Randy' s girlfriend?!
I mean, it' s not like I never did anything for him.
I advised him how he could borrow against that old crappy house his mom left him.
How did you feel after you slept with your cousin' s girlfriend?
He' s not even a cousin, really,
He' s my uncle' s wife' s brother' s kid.
So he' s not a blood relative or anything.
No.
I keepwaiting.
It' s like she' s teasing me.
I' m dying to give her legal advice.
Woman:
Excuse me.
Thanks.
- Sorry about the mess,
I' m in the middle of changing offices.
How well did you know Greg Spradling?
Uh, not that well, we worked here for the last four or five years.
You were both upfor the same promotion, weren' t you?
No, not --
No disrespect for the dead --
So no matter who I' m talking to, she' s Just -- she' s on my mind.
Can you think of anything that might be useful to us in our investigation?
Sounds to me like he picked upsome rough trade.
Who knows what happened?
There could have been...... leather.
There could have been some bondage...
Maybe those spiky things...
Maybe some whipping.
Could have been pretty kinky.
But we all know what that' s like, right?
No sir, I don' t.
That' s how much she messed me up.
I mean, I' m being investigated for a murder, and all I can think about is her.
And the whip?
- Yes.
There was another reason I went to see her that day.
Something had come up at work
The shoeprints we found on Winfield road turned out to be Converse All- Stars, the same brand the boyfriend wore
And if he was there, there was a chance she might have been
I had the same sick feeling in my stomach that I had when I was waiting for The results to come back from the lab at the hospital
Unfortunately, her print did match one at the murder site
That scum, that boyfriend of hers
There' s no telling what he forced her to do before I came along -- I wasn' t going to let her get dragged into a murder investigation
I knew she had nothing to do with it
There' s something I have to ask you.
Is it an inside question or an outside question?
There was a burglary last week on Winfield Road.
A man was killed.
- Was she able to convince you that she didn' t have anything to do with it?
She was very convincing
It was a miracle!
Sex?!
There was sex?
God helpme, It was wonderful.
No, for me to helpyou,
I- I need to hear everything.
See, you have to tell me all about the- the- various acts of physical congress between --
- I already told you that.
Okay, no, that' s fine,
I' m not -- it doesn' t --
I shouldn' t have done that.
It' s okay, I wanted to.
Are you going to arrest Randy?
I' ve got a warrant out for him now.
That car he' s driving is stolen.
Add a murder charge to that and you won' t see him for a long time.
So I' il get to keepthe house.
This is all I have left.
How not perfect can one woman be?
Aces in the boink department.
Got yourself a snazzy new watch.
Like this is supposed to make everything better?
But you gotta admit, that' s a beaut.
Here' s the money, Just take it.
Take it!
- Shh!
Kid -- easy, easy.
Would the owner of a blue Geo Metro
Missouri license plates 87KP03 please report to the front desk.
Is that my car?
You got any idea what they want?
No.
Is there any possibility that she might have --
- Yeah.
I want to remind everyone that Saturday is "Hawaiian night."
She gave me a stolen car.
C' mon, let' s get out of here.
Sir, is this your car?
That piece of shit?
Officer, what do I look like?
You know, to tell you the truth, she doesn' t sound worse than most of 'em.
- But you' il do it, right?
Business is business.
What do you think?
Oh, what do I think?
But ours is a forgiving God.
But I destroyed evidence
I withheld information for a murder investigation
- Charlie, look --
The kind of happiness that a...... a good woman can bring a man.
Yes, I have this great Job and this great office and this great family and this great house --
How does this make you feel?
Empty.
I feel nothing.
And who knows, it happened so fast.
I mean, here' s this guy in my office --
-- what is he, thirty- five years old -- and he goes like that.
I could walk out of your office and get hit by a truck.
I don' t want to live like that anymore.
Let me Just feel something, anything, and then I will look up and I will say,
Thank you for that gift. "
And... then if the truck wants to get me, then okay.
She makes me feel...
Thank you.
I' m sorry.
- Have you acted on your desire to see this woman again?
Do you think I should?
Time' s up.
What?
Sorry, time' s up.
What, are you kidding me?
- Your time' s up.
Just tell me that!
So this is it, huh?
Point is, she ain' t anywhere around.
Go out, talk to the clerks in stores, waitresses, the works.
- Yeah.
Make some long distance calls.
- Gotcha.
Not so fast, Slick.
Now I' il take the money.
Oh, yeah.
There it is.
Ten thousand dollars.
You' re not gonna count it?
Nah.
No.
But I do kill people.
I' il be callin 'by seven.
You think I' m a bad person?
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Would you like to try our new fragrance?
Good after --
- No thanks.
Hi sir.
No thanks.
Yeah?
Hey buddy, It' s me, Randy.
- Hey, I was Just talkin 'to somebody about you.
What, uh, what' s up?
- Not a whole hell of a lot.
I' m Just here in Collinsville.
Oh...
So, uh, so she didn' t go with you?
- No, man.
And you know what?
Thing' s will work out fine.
Do you really think so?
- Absolutely!
Okay.
Stay there!
TV:
Are you all alone?
Are you heartbroken?
Did something happen to the romance?
Did things get out of hand, and now you' re afraid they' ve gone too far?
Are you about to lose that someone special forever?

# When love comes rollin 'upyour way #
# Open up and let that breeze blow #

No, I don' t want to talk to the kids.
You don' t have to -- Hi, Sweetie!
Um, ah, no.
Daddy' s not gonna be home.
What do you mean?
Well, how did the dog get out?
Well, where' s his leash?
Okay, Daddy' s gotta --
Daddy' s gotta go.
- Dad, don' t -- Okay, Sweetheart.
Cosmetic department, please.
Cosmetic department!
you can' t Just barge into somebody' s house!
Keepyour hands up, Scummo.
You need a search warrant.
I happen to be an attorney.
I Just made partner at the second- largest law firm in the state.
That' s where I' ve seen you before.
You need a search warrant.
This is my girlfriend' s house!
Bullshit!
This is Randy Weltzer' s house.
He' s your cousin?
- Yes.
And as his attorney, I can assure you that he will be filing a suit against you and the entire St. Louis Police Department.
Well, I guess it' il be right after he stands trial for the murder of your former associate Gregory Spradling.
Wh- what?!
Are you crazy?
Mister, you better take a good long look in the mirror before you call somebody else crazy.
I' m takin 'you in.
Okay, um, for what?
For murder.
You and Spradling were in competition for the same position.
What?!
First of all, I am not gay.
Interesting choice of wardrobe, then.
Ha ha!
I' m so not gay,
I oughta shoot you right now.
That' s enough!
Freeze!
Freeze!!!
You better watch it, buddy, I am an attorney!
Get down!
You' re making a very serious mistake!
Shut up!
- Ungh!!!
Un!!!
Carl:
Okay, here she is.
She' il clear up this whole thing.
What are you doing here?!
What' s goin 'on?
It' s not what it looks like.
Why are you wearing that?
Like you don' t know.
Hey, I' m not the one who' s got him bent over the table.
Carl, what are you doing here?!
Where is Jewel?
It was Just that one time with me and Jewel, I swear.
What do you mean, one time?
You' re Iyin '.
She never let you touch her.
Yeah, not like you, her "boyfriend."
Do you believe that?
He calls himself Jewel' s boyfriend!
I' m warning you.
Where is she?!
I was expecting her here any minute!
Why do you think I' m dressed like this, for Halloween?
We gotta find her!
You are violating a restraining order and are under arrest!
You don' t understand.
Someone is coming here to kill her!
Huh?
No.
Which one of you homos killed my brother?
I' m not gay --
Shut up!
I understand the man that killed my brother, Utah, he lives here.
And I' m not leaving 'till I kill him.
Now, which one of you was it?
I said, which one of you was it!?
I- I- I' m an attorney.
I' m sure you and your brother were very close -- that' s good.
Avenging his death, wanting to avenge his death, that' s admirable, who doesn' t understand that?
But as a lawyer...
What the hell?
You want to explain to me what you' re doing
looking through the window of my house?
Give me your gun.
I lost my dog, uh -- he came off his leash.
And you need a. 357 for that?
Jewel.
Aah!
Lord, please don' t let them find me in this outfit!
Yeah, I know what you mean.
When I' m on the road a few days
You have a house?
Oh, yeah -- I' m a real homebody.
You have a DVD?
If you' re gonna have a first- rate home entertainment center, you gotta have a DVD.
Not that my place doesn' t need some fixin 'up.
Yeah.
Thank you, God!

Are you sure you don' t wanna go to my room?
No.
Why?
My roommate' s already moved out.
Okay, Jim, relax.
Relax.
No strings attached, okay?
Yeah, right.
Uh, yeah, but you see, it' s just that, um, we' ve never even had friendly hello sex.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, I do.
No, I definitely do.
Uh, it' s just that, you see, this is actually my first time.
It' s my first time, uh, since my... first time.
So, technically, that' s my second time.
And I -- I don' t -- I don' t wanna suck at it.
So if I' m not up to par, performance- wise --
Jim, this isn' t exactly a turn- on.
I mean, girls like a guy with confidence.
Hey, I' m confident.
Oh, I am -- I' m absolutely, totally confident.
Yeah.
Okay.
Seems like just yesterday my dad picked me up after my first year at college.
- We popped a couple of beers, and he said, "Now, you' re a man."
And today I get to say the same thing to my son.
Honey, your speeches embarrass him.
So, try and do what the kids say, and just... be cool.
I think I bring new meaning to the word "cool," honey.
That' s his dormitory up ahead.
Okay.
Can' t bring alcohol in the dorms.
Oh, uh, good.
I' m just here to surprise my son Jim.
What?
Uh- huh.
Oh, yeah.
Maybe you can help me out, you know.
Is that the one?
No.
There!
Now I remember.
I didn' t do this for you.
Thanks, dude.
Hey --
- Jesus!
- Jim, we got here a little early.
- Dad, get out!
- I' il wait in the car.
Go, Dad!
Oh, my -- Geez.
Was that your dad?
- I' m so sorry.
- For your own edification, son, I just -- I' m not embarrassed.
- I am!
- It' s a perfectly normal thing for two --
- This is human nature.
Son, everybody does it.
Your mother and I -- Well, not so much anymore.
Got your favorite.
Oh, my God!
They' re fucking!
No!
- Honey, honey, listen.
No, no.
I' m gonna take her --
Hi, Mama.
What?
- Natalie!
- I' m Jim' s dad.
You must be the parents of this young lady.
I' m sorry I didn' t get her name, but hopefully my son did... because I have not been here the whole time. because I have not been here the whole time.
Natalie, get dressed!
- Beer?
- Avert your eyes!
Turn around!
You don' t believe in locks?
Oh, my God.
Heya, fuckface.
- Mornin ', dude.
It' s show time.
Ooh!
There' s little hearts on her panties!
There' s little hearts on her panties!
Come on, look, you pussy.
What the fuck, man?
Come on!
I' m disappointed in you.
Here it is, the end of our freshman year and you screwed one girl.
One.
Look at the Stifmeister.
I got laid 23 times this year, and I' m not counting the hummer I got in the library stacks, baby.
All right, here' s a new idea for you, Stifler, okay?
You don' t bother counting how many times you have sex with each other.
- You just laugh at the people that do count.
- Here' s a new idea for you.
I' il get you a spoon so you can eat my ass.
Notebooks closed.
Holy shit, dude.
We got an exam today?
You kiddin 'me?
Yes!
I' m never even gonna think about political science again.
Hey.
How' d you do?
Last thing I need is more classes.
You' re gonna have a great time.
Hello, summer!
Yeah, it sucked.
Ozzy!
Kev, what' s up, man?
How are you?
Put your party hat on.
We got 12 weeks of immortality ahead.
Weird.
Ah, the one that got away, huh, son?
Yeah.
Well, evidently you two made quite the handsome couple on the Internet.
Oh, I didn' t see it.
It, uh, was brought up at a P. T. A. meeting.
Anyway, my point is, these little sexual debacles should not get you down, because you know what?
It happens to the best of us.
In fact, the first time your mother and I... got together,
Well, she referred to it as "shrink wrapping."
But I got over it.
Anyway, keep your chin up.
You keep plugging... and, uh, good things will happen.
Good to have you home, son.
It' s good to be home, Dad.
It' s gonna be nice to hit Stifler' s tonight after exams.
Did you get through 'em?
There' s the mystery man!
Finch, how are you?
Konichiwa.
Konichiwa.
It' s Japanese.
Hello.
- Finch, what happened to Latin?
- I met a Japanese girl at the art museum.
Changed majors.
- You got laid in an art museum?
- The Met.
- Oh, and the Guggenheim with Francesca.
- The Guggenheim?
- But I' il tell you, none of these women... even compare to --
Stifler' s mom.
Stifler' s mom is a goddess.
How about some more of Stifmeister' s collegiate concoction?
This thing is like half alcohol.
You' re just trying to get me drunk.
Mary, would I do that?
My name' s Christy.
Christy, right, right.
Beautiful name.
Like it matters.
Hey.
Johnny C., how' s it going?
You' re an asshole.
All right, everybody having a good time?
Fellas!
How' s it going?
The keg' s back there as always.
Enjoy.
Ladies, I' m Steve Stifler and I have an 11 - inch penis... around!
Think about it.
Sherman!
Okay, Stifler, take your shot.
Come on, man.
All right.
Hey.
Hey, are you Steve Stifler?
- Yes, I am.
- Well, thank you for throwing this awesome party, man.
- No problem.
- Yeah, the cops bust all our parties now.
Well, I put the word out... so high- school chicks would come.
Just 'cause you fuckers don' t have dicks doesn' t make it right for you to be here, you know.
- Uh, hey, man, could I ask you a question?
- Sure, son.
Is it true that Paul Finch nailed your mom?
Sons of bitches.
My mom' s a saint!
Go suck some dick!
Hey, Carlos, Jason.
What' s going on?
Keg' s back on the deck.
Hey, how' s Iowa State?
Did you see those fuckers I had to boot outta here?
Back at Stifler' s.
It' s just like old times.
One difference.
We' re college men now.
I might actually have a chance.
Hey, I remember you.
Oh, do you now?
"Oh, wait, Nadia, don' t go." Splat.
Pathetic.
Loser.
It' s exactly like old times.
I' m gonna miss you.
I' il miss you.
I' il call you when I get in, okay?
Okay.
Bye- bye.
I can' t believe those two girls, Kevin.
Jim, it' s not a big deal.
Yeah.
They toyed with my emotions.
Hello.
See?
There' s other girls.
- How are ya?
Hey, Jessica' s here.
With Vicky.
And Vicky got... hot!
What' s that supposed to mean?
Look at her.
Yeah, Jim, I see her.
Hey, Kevin.
I' il be right back.
Hey, Vic, how are you?
I' m okay.
Yeah, I' m good.
That' s good.
It' s good to hear.
Wow.
Well, this is about as comfortable as a high colonic in Tijuana.
And I would know.
Okay.
I' m gonna get a drink.
She' s right.
Why is this so weird?
See, I knew it.
You know, and we could still be friends, right?
I miss you, Kev.
Friends, right?
Yeah, right.
I was -- It was just... an old habit -- a friend kiss.
- Vic, why wouldn' t I wanna be friends with you?
Look, we' il -- we' il just do this, okay?
Friends.
Friends.
Ozzy!
There he is.
Shake off your chains of monogamy.
You' re a free man.
I don' t think so.
Dumb ass.
What happened to the 'nova I knew in high school?
The guy who had all the moves?
Yeah, he was an idiot.
Yeah, but he was my idiot.
Hey, everyone!
And he' s taking the locks off his cock!
Ozzy, I' m lobbing you a softball here.
Pull out your bat and take a swing.
Mandy.
All- state lacrosse three years in a row.
Hey, Oz.
Hi, Mandy.
How are you?
Listen, I have a girlfriend.
Beer out back.
You pussy!
Stifler' s mom' s room.
How did you do that magic you did?
Tantra.
What the fuck are you doin 'in here?
- Just relax.
- You get out of my house!
Jesus Christ!
Hey!
Easy!
That' s enough.
Okay, guys, we went through this last summer, all right?
Finch got a black eye and Stifler got six stitches.
'Cause you fuckin' bit me!
- You touch me, I bite.
- You two relax and shake hands.
Shake this!
Why is everybody taking a piss right now?
The line' s too long.
I ain' t gonna make it, man.
Hey, bro.
Hey, man, you' re the guy who boned Stifler' s mom.
Hey, you are a god.
Holy shit, dude.
If I didn' t have to hold my dick 'cause I gotta piss so bad, I would shake your hand.
I' m honored, guys.
Don' t leave.
How?
How?
Oh, look what I found, Christy.
Oh, what a coincidence.
I' ve been saving this for a special occasion... for a special girl, just like you.
You' re so sweet.
That' s what they say.
Oh, weird.
I spilled some on you.
Maybe I should mop that up.
Thanks.
No problem.
Whoa, hey.
Right.
You know, they warn us about these situations in college.
Now, you may be intoxicated.
Oh, yeah.
Are you certain that you wish to engage in "consensing" --
Hey, don' t count your chickens, buster.
I' m just playing by the rules, baby.
That' s a pretty good fucking rule.
Dude, the line' s too long.
I' il never make it.
It' s gotta happen now.
Go, bro.
- Oh, Laurie.
How are you?
Hey.
How are you?
Hi, Lori.
- Good.
I' m really good.
- How 'bout I give you a little champagne?
- Why don' t you go downstairs and get us a couple beers?
- I' ve got a surprise for you.
- Why don' t you go downstairs and get us a couple beers?
- I' ve got a surprise for you.
Oh, I' m ready.
You want a beer?
Okay, go.
This is kind of kinky, and I like that.
Ohhh!
That' s it.
Bathe the Stifmeister.
How did you get it so nice and warm?
Actually, I can' t.
Much better.
Wait a second.
Let' s go.
Thanks, man.
Christy?
Oh, fuck!
Yep.
Half of these got East High parking passes on 'em.
Call a couple units.
Isn' t this the Stifler house?
Yeah.
You ever seen Mrs. Stifler?
Oh, what a "milf."
No way.
Cops!
- Cops!
Party' s over.
Let' s go.
Ostreicher, Meyers.
- Welcome back.
- Where' s Steve Stifler?
I got peed on.
No, man, Stifler' s got shut down.
We can' t party anywhere anymore.
And things are --
Getting weird?
Yeah, a little bit.
Yep, things are gonna get weirder.
- What are you talkin 'about?
- Well, times change, people change.
It' s just what happens, you know.
Go into my old room.
You remember my first college summer?
We rented that lake house in Grand Harbor.
We treated every day out there like it was a post- prom party.
We capped it all off with a massive blowout.
It was legendary.
My advice is do that.
I love adventure Nothing' s better to me
She' s on the phone.
She' s on the phone.
Who?
Nadia!
Nadia!
What?
New York.
She' s on -- Hello.
Yes, dear, he' s right here.
Here.
Now remember --
Right.
Okay.
I know they' ve done wonderful things with that city, but, you know, for me --
- Dad!
- He' s right -- Hang on.
Jim!
How was college?
Yeah.
Yeah, it was -- it was really excellent.
You have not forgotten about me, have you?
I, uh -- Absolutely not.
I definitely didn' t.
Good, because guess what?
I' m coming to see you at the end of summer.
I hope you' re ready for me... because I have not forgotten about you either, you sexy boy.
Shit.
Jim, you can eat hot dogs tomorrow.
No, no, Finch, it' s not the hot dogs.
Nadia called me this morning.
She' s coming here at the end of the summer and she wants to see me.
- Oh, that' s killer.
- Yeah, that' s a good thing.
Not "killer."
I' il never be able to do it.
Nadia is gonna be expecting filet mignon.
Okay, and all I' m gonna be able to give her... is rump roast.
Aw, come on.
Jim, you' ve had experience since Nadia.
Yes, that' s great experience.
That' s the one.
Ah, you just gotta find the right girl, Jimbo.
Brings it all together.
I had the right woman.
She just sells her cottage and takes off to parts unknown.
Oh, my romantic life has past its peak.
Take me out to the pasture and shoot me.
Super start to a super summer, fellas.
Welcome home.
Guys, I got it.
Pack your bags.
- We' re moving to the lake.
Everybody on the beach is gonna know us.
Plenty of opportunities to practice for Nadia.
Throw a huge party at the end of the summer to cap it all off.
Dude, that' s a great idea.
This is it.
This is my summer of love.
Just thought I' d say good- bye to you animals.
Hey, Mr. Levenstein.
Hey.
- All packed up I see.
- Yeah, we' re all set, Dad.
I' il be fine.
- Keep it real, homies.
Have a good summer.
All right, let' s go.
I' ve been running these numbers here and I don' t think the four of us can afford this place.
- Not on summer jobs.
- Well, I kind of thought of that.
I invited someone else.
The Stifmeister' s coming back to Grand Harbor!
Bye- bye, Great Falls!
Wipe my ass and lick my balls!
It' s Stifler time, baby!
Stifler, if you' re gonna be living with us you gotta behave yourself.
All right, you and Finch just stay out of each other' s way.
Kevin, Stifler' s stench is unavoidable.
Finch, fist yourself.
We' re here.
Yeah, baby, we' re here!
Whoo- hoo- hoo!
It' s a palace.
It' s a temple.
Isn' t this great?
Are you kidding me?
I' il do everything
I' m lost around you
When I can' t even try
Yeah, you get me high I' m feeling so low
I' m knocked down by the vertigo
Check this out.
I fall behind you
Will you idiots tell me what this fucker' s doin '?
What the fuck is tantric?
It' s a Buddhist discipline.
You learn to channel your body' s energies -- your chakras.
When you can do that, you can have sex for hours, even days.
- And this stuff' s for real?
- It' s been around for centuries.
Well, maybe you can teach me sometime?
True.
Come on, Jim.
Oh, no?
No way.
Oh, yeah?
Where' s she this summer?
Hey, are you here for the mid- session performance?
Guests go in the amphitheater.
You can' t be here.
Do you know where I could find Michelle Flaherty?
Food attracts animals.
This one time, a bear came, and then the bear had to be destroyed, which means they shot it in the head with a rifle and killed it and it died.
You must know Michelle.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
That' s a lot of flutes.
Thanks.
Good job.
Have fun at your next class.
Jim.
Holy potatoes!
Everybody stick together.
Oh, shoot!
'cause this one time, uh... here, this kid had these cookies -- this kid had these cookies --
A bear came.
Was that a question?
I don' t know.
Maybe.
Do you wanna answer it anyway?
Michelle, um,
I left you like, uh -- like three messages after prom.
Really?
You didn' t think I was weird because of the way I acted that night?
Weird, no.
Surprising, yes.
I get nasty when I' m horny.
That' s kind of why I' m here.
Um, you remember, was I any good... that- that night?
Oh, wow.
How could I forget?
You didn' t know what the hell you were doing.
But wasn' t it fun even though you were so terrible?
I' m sorry.
Oh.
Oh, sorry.
Oh.
Oh, shoot.
I' il meet you in an hour, okay?
Yeah.
- What are you doing?
- Ooh.
You know you' re not supposed to be here now.
All right.
It' s piss- poor to be this late.
I' m very angry right now.
I' m pissed off is what I am.
Cut 'em off.
Are you Petey?
Petey?
Petey!
Well, that explains everything.
Go!
Petey, we are just so thrilled to have you.
Watch that.
Oh, great.
Here you go.
Oh, look at this.
I know it' s not yours, but you are going to make beautiful music.
This is fantastic.
You just own this and break a leg.
All right, all right.
- Who knows?
I' m about fed up with these Tall Oaks North kids.
Kids, entertain yourselves.
Play along with Petey.
Here we go.
Come on, now.
Folks, he' s just a little nervous.
This isn' t right.
Just blow on it, kid.
Here we go.
Uh -- Come on, Petey.
Play!
Do something.
Come on.
Give the little guy some support.
Come on, Petey.
Come on, honey.
You can do it.
Come on, Petey.
Oh, what the hell.
All right!
All right, Petey!
Come on!
Thank you!
Thank you, Tall Oaks.
My name is Petey!
Thank you!
I --
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Come back here!
I wanna talk to you!
You are so sweet.
He is... special.
He' s my bitch.
Well, Michelle has confirmed it.
What?
I gotta get some practice.
Don' t worry about it.
I mean, that' s why we got the house, Jimbo.
We plop a keg on the deck, and the girls come in off the beach.
It' s like a hummingbird feeder.
You think so?
I know so.
Guaranteed hotties.
Fellas, nice pad.
Good view, but... the Sherminator sensors detect no female life- forms in the vicinity.
The girls are comin '.
The Sherminator' s got a point, Kev.
Since when do you start listening to the Sherminator?
Since he made me realize there' s an abundance of wiener here.
Dude?
All right, now it' s your turn.
Oh, come on.
There' s nothing to tell.
Hey, what' s up?
What are you guys talking about?
So, Vicky?
Well, there was this one guy.
How 'bout you?
Oh, you know, there was a few girls -- three.
Ooh, look at you.
You stud.
All right, Oz.
Now that Kevin told us, what about you?
You haven' t had the slightest bit of attraction to any girl at school?
I know you did.
Even if I did, it wouldn' t be anything more than just a momentary thing.
Very... uninteresting.
And how about you, Jessica?
- How many chicks did you sleep with this year?
- Fuck yeah, I would.
- Come on, Ozzy.
Ball.
Poo" s yours.
- Hey, Vic, you wanna play?
You wanna break?
Where are the fuckin 'females?
Jim, can' t you leave your shirt on?
Jim, can' t you leave your shirt on?
Dude, give him a break.
Ozzy, go deep.
Yeah, bro.
You playing?
No.
No, no, keep going.
Flag pattern.
- What are you doin '?
- Fishin '.
- You okay?
- Oh, man, I' m so sorry.
Is everybody okay?
The Force is strong in that one.
Whoa.
The Sherminator detects serious heat at a distance of two meters.
let me give you a valuable piece of advice, okay?
Drop the whole "Sherminator" thing.
Please repeat previous statement.
Look, I know your last name is Sherman, right?
And that rhymes with The Terminator which was a big hit movie ten years ago.
But you can' t tell me a gir" s ever really gone for it.
System overload.
What a freak.
Vic, hey, you guys are leaving?
You know, we barely had a chance to hang out, you know, catch up.
Well, what are you doing this weekend?
I can get together.
Cool.
Let' s hang out.
All right.
Bye, Kev.
See ya, Jess.
No, no, that' s all wrong.
Thank you.
Good- bye.
So what does he mean, "meet up"?
I told you, we' re just friends now.
Oh, yeah, I' m sure he understands quite well.
Oh, no, sir.
I mean, seriously.
Well, we' re friends.
Right.
I don' t see her with a boyfriend.
I think that puts me on deck.
- Hey, Vicky only slept with one guy since we went out.
I mean, that like makes me 50% of her entire guy- related life.
You dipshit.
She slept with at least three.
- What?
- When a girl tells you how many guys she slept with, multiply it by three and that' s the real number.
Didn' t you fuckers learn anything at college?
Look, he did not sleep with three girls, okay?
It' s not gonna happen.
But why would he lie to me?
It' s an adjustment.
The rule of three.
It' s not a lie.
It' s an adjustment.
The rule of what?
A guy tells you how many girls he' s hooked up with, it' s not even close to that.
Take that number and divide it by three.
So, if Kevin' s saying it' s been three girls, it' s more like one, or none.
- None?
- Rule of three.
It' s an exact science, consistent as gravity.
Ozzy, I' m happy for you.
At least you' ve seen a nice bod while Heather' s off sucking dick.
Sifler, keep your fantasies to yourself.
Dude, use your fuckin 'brain.
La, la, la.
"Ooh, hey.
Love your accent.
Love your ding- dong. "
I' m telling you, man, right now there is a dick in your girlfriend' s mouth.
Knock it off.
What' d I say?
Oh, my God!
Check it out.
Lesbians.
Lesbians live here.
You know, Mr. Homophobic Wizard, that it is possible for women to hold hands and not be gay.
Friends can hold hands.
Hey, Finch, I don' t wanna hear about you and your boyfriends.
Go jerk off.
Unnecessary.
I' m filling up to the brim.
That' s fucking disgusting!
Oh, I' m gonna throw up.
- Hello?
- Hey, Heather.
- Oz!
- How' s the studying going?
I' ve been going to the Picasso Museum, hanging out at Sagrada Familia, going with Pierre to the Parc Guell.
Hey, who' s Pierre?
One of the guys in the program.
He' s got a girlfriend back in France, so we' ve kind of got something in common.
Ah, that sounds cool.
Yeah, I' ve overheard them on the phone at night.
And, uh, well, it made me think.
Oh ho ho ho!
It' s phone sex.
Help me out here.
Uh --
I' m going over to my bed.
And I' m lying down.
And I' m slowly... reaching downstairs.
Tell me how big it is.
Listen, Heather, I' m feeling kind of awkward.
If we can' t physically be with each other, then we have to learn to be more vocal.
Right.
Okay.
Okay, here we go.
I' m reaching in my pants now.
And I' m rubbing it for you, Heather.
And it feels so good.
Yeah, me too.
I got --
Oh, shit.
Hello?
Wrong number.
Hello.
Wrong number.
All right, look, man.
I got my hand on my dick right now, okay, and I' m trying to have sex with my girlfriend over the phone.
Hey.
Sorry about that.
Where were we?
I think you were reaching for something.
Oh, yeah.
I' m rubbing it and it feels so good.
Hey, Oz, I' m touching myself.
What else do you want me to do?
Oh, Heather, baby.
Why don' t you tell me my dick is as big as Stifler' s.
- Stifler, get off!
- I am getting off just listening to the two of you.
- Keep going.
- I think we should try this another time.
Yeah, all right.
I love you.
- I love you.
- Come on, you guys.
I was almost there!
- Nice talking with you, Steven.
Repressed.
Repressed.
Check it out.
All right.
Hey, man, what are you doing?
Stifler?
Stifler.
Stifler?
Oh, shit, dude!
- Stifler.
- Big blue rubber dicks for everyone!
- The people demand rubber dicks!
- Finch, help.
- The people demand rubber dicks!
Dildo, dildo, dildo!
- What are you doing?
- I' m looking for more lesbian artifacts.
Finch' s ass.
Oh, my God.
Guys, they' re back.
Come on.
Come on!
Come on.
- This is awesome!
Hey.
Just needed the paper, huh?
Mm- hmm.
W- Which room?
I can' t remember shit.
- I' m in a lesbian stronghold.
- Was it in here?
- Shit, man.
- Was it in here?
Maybe.
Was it or was it not here?
You gotta get out of there.
Oh, shit balls.
- Very original, Steven.
- Don' t call me Steven.
I can wear that little leopard bikini of mine.
It' s so cute on you.
Help unzip me, please.
Thanks.
- Hey, have I shown you my cute little pink shoes?
- Does it match the pink bikini?
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, man.
They can' t hear us inside?
No, man.
This girl is so hot.
Two possible lesbians in their bras and panties.
- Lesbians?
- Uh --
Did you say lesbians?
- Hot lesbians!
Don' t touch me.
I' m not.
That better not have been what I thought it was.
Look at you and look at me.
Too big.
I' il get you the blue stringy number.
Johnny West is missing.
Maybe you kicked it under the bed.
- Okay, let me look.
Didn' t you have it when we were downstairs?
Oh, maybe.
Guys, get the hell out of there right now.
Come on.
It' s clear!
Go, go, go!
They' re coming back.
Oh, I' m just so glad I found him.
He' s my favorite collectible.
I know.
Hey, guys, we got nothing to worry about.
I got that dildo from the other bedroom.
There' s a dildo in my drawer.
Oh, my God!
Shh!
What the hell was that?
I don' t know.
Call 9 11.
No 9 11.
My God, it' s the painting kids.
I' m still calling the cops.
Okay, look.
Stifler did break in here.
You dick!
But we just followed him in to get him out.
I just wanted proof that you chicks are really lesbians.
Yeah, it' il be fun.
Let' s do it.
You guys... like that?
Ozzy, stand by for confirmation.
That' s a big 10- 4 on the confirmation.
Sounds like your little friends outside wanna play too.
Sounds like your little friends outside wanna play too.
You won' t be needing this.
Who wants me to touch Amber?
- I do, I do.
- Who the hell is that?
Who' s this?
Uh, this is John...
Smith.
Where should I touch Amber?
Ass, baby.
Okay.
That' s nice.
I know.
Excuse me?
That' s good.
It' s good.
Yeah, so I got some painting I should, uh -- It' s --
I can handle it.
What?
Stifler, I' m comfortable with my sexuality.
And I would love to see that show.
Bravo!
One finger... on the cheek.
We want... palm... grasping.
Oh, that' s too much.
You don' t touch, we don' t touch.
- Squeeze his ass, son.
You' il like it.
- Come on, boys.
Oh, shit.
I' m touching his ass.
Red Leader, what' s your position?
I' m touching his ass.
Mommy!
You can go.
That really wasn' t bad.
I wanna go home.
That' s too bad.
I' m staying.
Danielle is feeling my breasts.
No way, dude!
Her breasts are so luscious.
What a wonderful Christmas gift you bought the boys.
My nipples are so hard.
I think I can fix these.
Sweet Jesus.
Your turn.
Oh, yeah!
Mm- mm.
Kiss.
Dude, no.
What?
Oh, yeah.
You want more?
We want more.
Go get him, tiger.
- You' re gonna love it.
- Do it for us.
Okay, dude.
One, two, three.
- That totally counted.
- That doesn' t even count.
- That totally counted.
- That' s how you kiss your mother.
- Don' t you say anything!
Make it real.
You do that, we' il do anything you want.
Anything.
Anything.
Promise.
I promise.
I wouldn' t lie.
That is what I' m talking about.
Ah, Kev, you can look.
Ooh!
That' s it.
Where' s your tongue?
Very good.
Dude, you' re a fuckin 'lousy kisser.
What?
I wasn' t trying!
That' s not fair!
I' m really --
I' m not -- No judgment.
Fuck no!
You were trying!
Oh, my -- That' s disg -- Oh, I kissed Jim!
Silence!
Yes?
As you were.
Here we go.
Ooh.
Amber!
Them girls sound like the two transvestites we picked up in Biloxi, Cooter.
Food' s ready.
I' m not hungry!
I can' t believe it.
Okay, okay, just do it.
Oh.
Oh!
Uh, Amber.
Okay, I think that' s enough.
I want more.
Yeah.
We' re gonna get more physical as soon as we get some --
- Hand jobs.
- Okay!
- Hand jobs.
- You, do him.
We love to watch.
You go.
You go.
We go.
Don' t be a wimp.
It' s okay.
I know what I have to do.
I need to keep this party goin '.
I' m takin 'one for the team.
Mother of God!
We had 'em.
I am not touching that.
Put that thing away, Stifler.
Why can' t you guys be team players, huh?
Whoo!
And now, for our devoted listeners, back to the show.
Amber, let me try that dildo.
Okay.
Now wait just a minute.
No.
Stifler wanted one from us.
- What?
Bullshit.
- No, he did, okay?
Very horrible.
You guys, you wanna play some "asshole"?
Hey, I just wanna do something together.
We just did something together.
Very together.
Stifler Claus is here.
Santa Porn has just brought us some heterosexual entertainment.
Here you go.
All right.
And the Stifmeister' s provided us some complimentary lubricant.
- Whack away, Jim.
- Does this stuff really make a difference?
- Oh, yeah!
- Really?
Stifmeister' s palace of love -- uh, straight love.
Oh, hey.
Yeah, I' m fine.
- That' s Stifler' s mom.
- Silence.
I didn' t really think you were gonna be in Michigan this summer.
Yeah, you' re more than welcome to be here.
We' re having a big party.
Okay, bye.
Uh, Stifler, was that --
She' s coming.
Stifler' s mom is coming here.
Efforts must be doubled.
"Efforts must be doubled."
Absolutely.
Jenny, where' d you put my clarinet?
I think I shoved it in your box.
Oh, thanks!
Bad man.
Michelle.
Hi.
Jim, what are you doing here?
I, uh -- uh -- Well, I thought you had said --
You can' t just stand out here.
Look, uh, I need your help.
Nadia' s coming back, and I don' t --
I don' t wanna be this awkward, bumbling, nervous guy with her.
I don' t wanna seem like a dork.
Well, I know that feeling.
Spend your life playing in the band, it doesn' t exactly give you the ultra- cool hipster image.
Seriously?
Yeah.
Michelle, why did you ditch me after prom?
I didn' t ditch you.
Our date was over.
It' s not like I wanted you to pretend you were in love with me or something.
Why would I pretend that?
Guys do that.
Yeah, well, I' m not like other guys.
Okay, I' m gonna help you.
Really?
Yeah, I feel bad for saying that you sucked, even though you kind of did.
Okay.
Uh, I' m just --
Let' s just get started.
Now, I' m a hot girl.
Right.
Okay, what do you wanna do?
I wanna feel your boobs.
No, you dingbat.
You don' t just go groping away.
You gotta preheat the oven before you stick in the turkey.
Kiss me, here.
Good.
Okay, now, the collarbone -- kiss.
Good, Jim.
Oh, you' re making me wet.
Really?
No, I was just saying that so you could practice.
Of course.
That was good.
Let' s work on something else.
Does direction matter -- like clockwise, counterclockwise -- make a difference?
Okay, Jim, this is what I' m talking about.
No.
The biggest pointer I could give you is... you have to feel comfortable in any situation.
Stand up.
Hmm?
- Ohh!
Now, this is a fucked- up situation.
What happened to preheating?
Oh, okay.
This is good.
This is good.
Ooh!
Wh- What?
You' ve got to control yourself and think of something nonsexual.
I haven' t even touched you yet, and you' re turning into the Sears Tower.
I' m sorry.
Yeah, uh, nonsexual.
Right, right.
Chairs.
Good.
Uh, uh -- Good.
Cleaning my bathroom.
Good.
Okay.
Now, don' t freak out.
Oh, that' s cold!
I just shoved a trumpet in your ass.
Aren' t instruments fun?
Okay, I think you' ve just crossed my threshold.
Call me in two weeks.
We can finish lessons.
Oh!
Pointer -- less tongue.
A guest book?
"Best thing was the blowout at Tom Meyers' place.
There he is.
"A night not soon to be forgotten.
August '93. "
It' s your brother, man.
Yeah, his cottage was right down on the beach.
Guys, this is what our party' s gotta be.
Something we' il always remember, you know?
Yes, definitely.
Absolutely.
- You go fish.
Oh.
Gin.
Just tell me why you' re here and who you are
And every time I sleep
I' m not alone
- I recognize the way you make me feel - What the fuck?
'Cause you' re everywhere to me
"Dear 'Jeem.'
"Chicago is beautiful, but it would be better if you were here.
I' m counting the days.
Love, Nadia. "
Well, I wish you were here, Nadia.
Have you been dirty?
Oh, yes, baby.
I' ve been dirty.
Do you want me to clean you?
"Apply a few drops to achieve desired lubrication."
All right.
Is that a loofah, or are you just glad to see me?
Oh, what the hell.
Shit.
God!
I been missin 'out.
Oh.
Ah!
Oh, shit!
Jeez --
Everybody okay?
Everything' s fine.
Shut the fuck up, or I' il break down this door and pummel your ass!
Everything --
I just fell out of the bed.
Okay, good night, then.
You sure?
Poison control.
Hello?
Yeah, I kind of, uh,
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, I kind of, uh, uh, Super Glued myself... to, uh, myself.
No.
Ow.
Don' t, uh, don' t send an ambulance.
Look, is there anything, uh, you know, around the house?
Paint thinner.
David?
Stay where you are!
Hands where we can see 'em!
Both hands!
Get the other hand up, goddamn it!
I can' t!
I' m glued!
I' m glued!
Sorry.
I' il take it from here, okay?
Don' t worry, Jimbo.
You' re gonna be fine, buddy.
Jim, this happens to the best of us.
Left foot first.
Good.
- Watch your head.
- All right.
Take a seat.
- Excuse me, sir.
Fuck, no!
This is just too good to miss!
And I would think any adhesive product... would have a warning right on the -- on the tube.
Son, couldn' t you have left that disgusting thing at home?
Excuse me?
Well, that kind of material is offensive to me.
Oh, well, we' re sorry.
But you see, my son couldn' t leave it at home... because he' s having a bit of a medical emergency.
Thanks, Dad.
Your opinion of his taste in video rentals, I' m afraid, is, uh, not a priority, lady.
Dad -- Okay?
It' s at the bottom of the totem pole.
Thank you, Dad.
My son... is sitting here right now... with his hand glued to his penis.
But that doesn' t mean anything to you, does it?
Dad --
I' m sorry, I' m sorry.
Ow!
You know, they speak --
How you doin ', son?
I' ve been better.
Boy, that doesn' t look too bad, Jim.
Good job, Doctor.
The swelling should subside in about eight or nine days.
The swelling should subside in about eight or nine days.
Eight or -- Eight or nine --
Beach party' s in a week.
Oh.
Doctor, my- my son has a party in seven days, and there' s a young lady coming... that he' s been waiting to -- he' s been waiting to get with.
I' d tell your son to keep his pants on during that party.
Oh, yes, yes.
Believe me, I will be doing that.
It goes without saying.
But if his pants... decide to come off during the party, could he have full use of his, um, penis?
Okay.
This should shave a couple of days off.
Oh, good.
Thank you, Doctor.
Jim, that' s good news.
This has been a good- news day, son.
Put this on.
Little chilly out there.
Well, here we are.
You know, Jim, um,
I think we should keep your mother in the dark about the incident tonight.
I think the whole glue thing might get her a little queasy.
I don' t know how I get myself into these things.
But thanks for understanding.
You' ve been really cool.
I mean, between this and, you know --
You know, you may be Jimbo or Jumbo... or Jimbodinny to these guys in here, but I want you to know there are two people... who still remember where James Emanuel Levenstein came from.
We' re awful proud of you, son.
Thanks, Dad.
Don' t forget your penis cream.
That was it.
That was a pure tantric moment.
The ficus, the water -- it was all erotic.
One more stimulant, I would have had full release.
Finch, stay the fuck away from that ficus.
- That' s a jizz- free ficus.
Morning, Jimbo.
Oh, very colorful.
My dick looks like a paint- by- numbers.
Jim, you' re the only guy I know whose dick needs an instruction manual.
Casa de Stifler.
Oh, hey.
What, you' re here now?
You know, if you want to hang out with these guys.
I' il meet you out front.
- Hey, Stifler, was that -- - Eat shit, Shitbrick.
She' s here.
My lady has arrived.
I gotta prepare.
Here we go.
Great.
Stifler' s mom is here?
This could be a disaster.
Whoa.
Moped?
Fuckers, fuckers, fuckers.
- That' s Stifler' s little brother.
Pussy, man.
I' m here for the pussy.
Take a number.
Gentlemen, why all the noise?
Everybody knows that this is my special day.
- What is that?
- Is that a fuckin 'dress?
Are you wearing a dress?
Shitbrick, meet my little brother.
- That' s your brother?
- Yes.
My lady' s not coming.
So my entire... stockpile is wasted, and I look ridiculous!
Excuse me.
That didn' t look too good.
No.
Let' s go find your room.
So, where are the fuckin 'females?
That only took, what, six weeks?
So, uh, are you alone too?
- Yep.
- Good.
I' m all alone.
Guess what I had in mind?
Hey, Marco, can you get your balls off me?
- Thanks.
- Heather, what the hel" s going on over there?
Uh, nothing.
It' s just my flatmates.
I guess this is kind of a lost cause, huh?
I can' t wait.
See ya this weekend?
- I can' t wait either.
- Bye- bye.
- Surprise!
- Holy -- Nadia!
You' re here?
You' re here.
What are you doing here?
But you' re -- you' re early.
Okay.
Nice to know you.
I will leave.
No!
Don' t leave.
No leaving.
Uh --
It' s just, I' m not gonna be ready --
I mean, the party won' t be ready, uh, until Saturday.
I can... stay here until then?
Yeah.
Is that okay?
Nadia.
Now.
Holy shit.
All right, I' ve got a plan.
How about I come back with you... and you say, 'Hello, this is Michelle, my girlfriend. "
And obviously, Nadia won' t expect you to hop in the sack.
And then we break up the day of the party.
And you' re all healed and back on the market.
- You' re evil.
- No way!
I' m like Cupid.
And I know how to make a girl jealous.
This is gonna be fun.
I' m sorry I didn' t tell you sooner, but we just started seeing each other a few weeks ago.
Um -- But I' d really love it... if you stayed here.
I think you should stay and have fun at the party.
Good for you, Jim.
Of course I will stay.
That' s grea -- Aiee!
That' s my nipples!
If you could only read my mind
Ain' t right
Bad, bad Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
You still broken?
I' m fine.
I might have to... actually go through with this.
I mean, okay, so she' s 50, 000 times hotter... than most girls, but... come on, it' s just sex.
Oh, no.
You saw the thing on the Internet.
Did it look like I might have had... a slight interest in Nadia then?
Add another year to that.
Okay.
Hey, why don' t you bring Nadia to the concert first?
It' il be a cool date.
We' il see how things go.
Michelle, you have been great.
Thank you.
Anytime.
Come on.
You ready to break up?
You big, stupid dummy!
Theater is so cool!
I don' t care if you are the best lay I' ve ever had in my life.
I hate your guts anyway.
Don' t say that.
And I don' t care if you did give me ten orgasms in a row, because you smell really bad.
I smell really bad!
Because we' ve been having so much sex, and -- and I haven' t showered, and I wanna shower!
So, don' t you go being all super- sexy guy anymore, because I am now impervious... to your unrelenting machismo and sexual ardor.
And that includes fucking me in the ass!
So there!
We had something special.
What' s up?
What' s up, dog?
Hey.
I' m so glad you came.
Can I help you?
Kevin.
What?
How sweet.
You don' t think I' m a dork?
Whatever you are, Jim, it is what I like.
Kevin left.
Didn' t look good.
Kevin left?
Just wandered down the beach.
Wanna tell us what' s up?
Wanna feel Finch' s ass?
No, I -- I went to say hi to Vicky, and she was there with a date.
You' re doing fine.
Rule of three, Oz.
I guess I was living in the past -- wanting to party with you guys... and be with Vicky, it' s just like high school.
You remember that day after prom?
You know, we made a toast to the next step.
I guess I never took it.
My brother said that by the end of the summer I' d see the big picture.
And I see it.
No matter what, times change and things are different.
The problem is, I don' t want them to be.
You know, Kevin, I haven' t moved on either.
I' ve been obsessed with the one woman I can' t have a real future with, other than a very kinky, extremely warped one.
I gotta find a new goddess.
It' s gonna take patience, but I' ve been celibate all summer.
Yeah, you kinda get used to it, though, huh?
Are you insane?
Hey, look, Kev, different does not necessarily mean worse.
As a matter of fact, I think things are just getting better.
Or am I gonna have to drag your ass back to that party and prove it to you?
Wow!
You know, you have beautiful eyes.
- Oh, you' re sweet.
Oh.
- Wanna fuck?
- Are you serious?
Come on, baby.
- I think you better -- - Your loss.
You know, you have beautiful eyes.
Come here, dude.
Come on.
You' re making an ass out of yourself.
You' re ruining my mojo.
And you' re not the Stifmeister, okay?
It takes years to develop true Stifmeister style.
I just wanna see some boobs.
Hey, Pop- Tart.
Dream on, midget.
Excuse him.
Take this.
You' re on cop watch.
Go out in the driveway.
See any cops, call me, okay?
Steve -- All right.
Gentlemen, uh, this appears to be a party.
Guys, if you' il excuse me, I' m gonna go look for Nadia.
Ahh.
So what was this year like for you?
Well, no.
When you travel as much as I do, you get used to moving on.
- Wow, can we go in there?
- The lighthouse?
Yeah.
Yes, we can.
How romantic.
Jim, come on.
Wow!
Wow!
Cool!
Jim, I have told you my memories from high school.
What are yours?
You have not changed.
Jim, relax.
We are just, how do you say, tooting our horns.
Actually, that is quite difficult.
How do you mean?
I --
Holy shit.
What?
Tell me.
I got stuck playing this trombone.
So I totally sucked.
And everyone thought I was this Petey guy, but I didn' t know what to think, so I just kept playing and playing, and I didn' t know what I was doing.
It was so funny!
What?
Why?
Nadia, please don' t take this the wrong way, but, but you' re -- you' re everything that I used to want.
And as much as I may really, really regret what I' m about to do, there' s somebody else I want to be with.
Nadia, I am a band geek.
I just never joined the band.
You go get your geek.
Someday I will find mine.
Well, my mind is now playin' tricks on me
Hey, um, Kevin Meyers.
Sorry I was a dick before.
It' s okay, man.
My name' s Brett.
Uh, could you give us a sec?
Sure.
Look, you don' t have to do this.
Maybe I was being selfish... in wanting to be your friend.
Maybe it' s just not gonna work.
Whoo- hoo- hoo!
Yeah- hah!
Yeah!
Hey.
What are you doing here?
I was gonna pick you up at the airport in, like, two hours.
I took an earlier flight, and I thought I' d surprise you.
Kinda weird without the phone, huh?
Come on.
I wanna hear all about it.
We' il grab you a drink.
Steve, this cop- watch thing is horseshit.
Hello?
Man, this sucks.
Who is it out there?
It' s the Stifmeister, baby.
Life' s a bitch, isn' t it?
It' s all right.
You don' t have to say anything.
I' m used to girls ignoring me.
Or making fun of me.
"Come on, Sherman.
Like the movie.
l- I get it, okay?
Maybe I am a geek.
Yes!
Yes, you are!
All right.
I... am the Sherminator.
A sophisticated sex robot sent back through time... to change the future for one lucky lady.
I am lucky lady?
That' s right, Nadia.
You' ve been targeted for Shermination.
Oh!
Help!
Fuck me, geek!
- Affirmative!
No fuckin 'way!
Forget it.
Like you have a chance.
Cheers, bud.
Hey, Steve, look what I found.
- Dude, don' t touch the shirt.
- Just look.
Hi.
Brilliant.
You found lesbians.
Lesbians?
We never said that.
- What?
- We never said that.
Oh, man.
Okay?
I' il caress it, even.
I' il shave some ass if they need it.
You heard me.
It' s true.
I' il kiss everybody here.
Dudes, chicks, everybody.
Because I am comfortable with my sexuality.
Oh, yeah.
At least have a drink with the Stifmeister.
All right.
That' s fair.
All right.
You truly are a Stifmeister.
- Welcome back to the party.
- Steve, those are my lesbians.
Ladies, I am down with the funky shit.
Like what?
One time at this party, I was drinking champagne --
Thank you.
Our next soloist will be Michelle Flaherty.
Petey?
This kid is killing me.
You suck, retard.
I' m not retarded.
You suck, retard.
I' m a very special boy.
- At night he lies awake and he wonders - Jim!
How' s this for a band camp story?
What would I do
Good for them.
Yeah, it' s awesome.
Yeah.
We' il be back.
Come on, baby!
You know, there' s only one word for that party: bitchin '.
Out of control.
Dude, am I gonna have a hangover?
Dude, am I gonna have a hangover?
'Cause I want one.
Good- bye.
Oh, my gosh.
We have to write about this party.
Look at my date!
He' s passed out!
He couldn' t hang out.
She holds her head
Within her hands
Quietly reeling
If only he could understand
What she' s feeling
Best summer ever, huh, fellas?
Sorry things didn' t work out for you, Finch.
You kiddin '?
Things are great.
So, are we gonna do this every summer?
Oh, yeah, we are.
Sweet car.
Stifler' s mom.
Hey, Finchy.
I called a couple of weeks ago.
Didn' t Steven tell you that I was gonna drop by sometime?
I guess it, uh, slipped his mind.
Hey, what' s your name?
Jeanine.
Jeanine.
I' ve been thinking, and, you know, I' m 19 years old.
I can' t be obsessed with one woman.
- Just can' t be.
- I' m glad you' re learning, Finchy.
Good.
Good.
- You want to get it on?
- You better clear your schedule.
See you guys later.
What about Dog Years?
Uh, give me, like, uh, three days.
- No.
- Yeah.
Yeah!
I think it was.
I think so too.
Son of a --
Who the hell was that?
Lookin 'for the lake.
What a dumbass.
The lake' s right there.
Incredible.
Ah.
What are you worried about?
You got a girlfriend now.
Everything in.
Pony up.
Let' s go.
She' s my girlfriend.
Let' s go!
Let' s go!
Hey, where' s Shitbrick?
The movies.
Took the bus.
Coffee.
Wait a second.
Who the fuck was in that car?
Yeah.
Jeanine.
Oh, Stifler' s mom!
Oh, Stifler' s mom!
Read the charges.
lead scientist of Galaxy Defence lndustries -- you stand before this council accused of illegal genetic experimentation.
How do you plead?
Not guilty!
My experiments are only theoretical -- completely within legal boundaries.
We believe you actually created something.
Created something?!
But that would be irresponsible and unethical.
I would never, ever...... make more than one.
What is that monstrosity?
Monstrosity!
What you see before you is the first of a new species.
I call it Experiment 6- 2- 6.
He is bullet- proof, fireproof and can think faster than supercomputer.
He can see in the dark and move objects 3, 000 times his size.
His only instinct:
To destroy everything he touches!
So, it is a monster.
Hey, just a little one.
It is an affront to nature.
It must be destroyed!
Calm yourself, Captain Gantu.
Perhaps it can be reasoned with.
Experiment 6- 2- 6 give us some sign you understand any of this.
Show us that there is something inside you that is good.
Hmm?
Meega, nala kweesta!
So naughty!
I didn' t teach it that.
Place that idiot scientist under arrest!
I prefer to be called "evil genius"!
It has no place among us.
Captain Gantu, take him away.
With pleasure.
Hmm.
Uncomfortable?
Oh...
Good!
The council has banished you to exile on a desert asteroid.
So, relax... enjoy the trip and don' t get any ideas.
These guns are locked onto your genetic signature.
They won' t shoot anyone but you.
Ow!
May I remind the captain that he is on duty.
Secure the cell!
Aye, Captain.
Captain on deck.
All ahead full.
Does this, uh, look infected to you?
Oh!
Quiet, you.
Gunfire in the cell bay!
Open a channel.
He' s loose on Deck C!
Red alert.
Seal off the deck!
Security, converge on door seven!
Deadly force authorised.
Fire on sight!
There he is!
Security to Bridge.
It' s in the ventilation system.
He' s headed for the power...... grid.
What was that?
I don' t think he' s on the ship anymore.
Confirmed.
He' s taken a police cruiser.
Yeah... he took the red one.
Yee- haw!
Hmm?!
That' s it!
We got it.
Hyperdrive activated.
System charging.
He' s engaged his H- drive!
Warning -- guidance is not functional.
Pursuit Commander, that crazy trog is about to make a jump!
Break formation!
Get clear of that ship!
Navigation failure.
Do not engage hyper...
Get me Galactic Control.
Where is he?!
He' s still in hyperspace.
Where will he exit?
Calculating now -- quadrant 1 7, section 0- 0- 5 area 51.
A planet called...
Ee- arth.
I want an expert on this planet in here now!
What is that?
Most of the planet is covered in it.
He won' t survive in water.
His molecular density is too great.
No...
Of course.
How much time do we have?
We have projected his landing at three hours, 42 minutes.
Oh, we have to gas the planet.
Hold it!
Hold everything!
Earth is a protected wildlife preserve.
We' ve been using it to rebuild the mosquito population which, need I remind you, is an endangered species!
Am I to assume you are the expert?
Oh, I don' t know about "expert."
Agent Pleakley at your service.
Can we not simply destroy the island?
Crazyhead!
The mosquito' s food of choice, primitive humanoid life- forms have colonies all over that planet.
Are they intelligent?
No, but they' re very delicate.
ln fact, every time an asteroid strikes their planet they have to begin life all over.
It' s fascinating, isn' t it?
With this, I' ve been able to study...
What if our military forces just landed there?
Well, that' d be a bad idea!
These are extremely simple creatures, miss.
Landing there would create mass mayhem and planet- wide panic!
A quiet capture would require an understanding of 6- 2- 6 that we do not possess!
Who, then, Mr. Pleakley, would you send for his extraction?
Does he have a brother?
Close grandmother, perhaps?
Friendly cousin?
Neighbour with a beard?
He got away?
I' m sure this comes as no surprise to you.
I designed this creature for to be unstoppable.
Which is precisely why you must now bring him back.
What?
And to reward you we are willing to trade your freedom for his capture.
6- 2- 6 will not come easily.
Maybe direct hit from plasma cannon might stun him long enough to...
Plasma cannon granted.
Do we have a bargain, Dr. Jumba?
B- B- But it' s a delicate planet!
Who' s going to control him?
You will.
Very good, Your Highness.
I...
Uh, you' re not joking!
So, tell me, my little one- eyed one on what poor, pitiful, defenceless planet has my monstrosity been unleashed?
Ke 'maila i K' lauea...
One, two, three, four...... M' lamalama i Wahinekapu...
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
Stop.
Stop.
Lilo, why are you all wet?
It' s sandwich day.
Every Thursday, I take Pudge the fish a peanut butter sandwich.
Pudge is a fish?
And today we were out of peanut butter!
So I asked my sister what to give him and she said a tuna sandwich.
Do you know what tuna is?
Fish?
It' s fish!
lf I gave Pudge tuna, I' d be an abomination!
'cause all we have is- is stinkin' tuna!
Lilo, Lilo, why is this so important?
Pudge controls the weather.
You' re crazy.
Please!
Everybody calm down!
Girls...
Shh.
Lilo...
I' m sorry!
I' m sorry!
I won' t do it again!
Maybe we should call your sister.
I' il be good!
I want to dance.
I practised.
I just want to dance.
I practised.
Ooh, she bit me.
Eww!
I called your sister.
She said to wait for her here on the porch.
We' il try again on Sunday.
Does this look infected to you?
Yeah.
You better not have rabies.
lf you have rabies the dogcatcher is going to have to cut...
Are you going to play dolls?
You don' t have a doll.
This is Scrump.
I made her, but her head is too big.
So I pretend a bug laid eggs in her ears, and she' s upset because she only has a few more days to...
Lilo!
Lilo?
Lilo?
Oh, no.
You better be home.
Watch where you' re going!
I found a new place to dwell...
Oh, Lilo!
Open the door, Lilo!
You make me so lonely, baby
Lilo?
I get so lonely...
Leave me alone to die.
For broken- hearted lovers to cry away their gloom
You are so finished when I get in there!
Oh, I' m going to stuff you in the blender push "puree," then bake you into a pie and feed it to the social worker!
What' s your secret? "
"Love... and nurturing."
Hi.
Uh...
You must be the, uh...
The stupidhead.
Oh...
Oh, you know, I' m really sorry about that and if I' d known who you were, of course I never would' ve...
I can pay for that.
It' s a rental.
Are you the guardian in question?
Yes.
I' m Nani.
Nice to meet you, Mister...?
Bubbles.
Mr. Bubbles.
That' s a strange...
Yes, I know.
Are you going to invite me in, Nani?
I thought we could sit out here and talk.
I don' t think so.
Uh...
This way.
Uh... wait here.
Hey!
lemonade?
Do you often leave your sister home alone?
Never.
Well, except for just now.
Uh, I had to run to the store to get some...
You left the stove on while you were out?
Low heat!
Just a simmer.
Mmm!
It' s coming along great.
I found that this morning.
There you are.
Honeyface... this is Mr. Bubbles.
Nice to meet you.
Your knuckles say "Cobra."
Cobra Bubbles.
You don' t look like a social worker.
I' m a special classification.
Did you ever kill anyone?
We' re getting off the subject.
Let' s talk about you.
Are you happy?
I' m adjusted.
I eat four food groups and look both ways before crossing the street and take long naps and get disciplined.
Disciplined?
She disciplines me real good.
Sometimes five times a day.
- With bricks.
Bricks?
Uh- huh, in a pillowcase.
Okay!
That' s enough sugar for you.
Why don' t you run along, you little cutie.
The other social workers just thought she was a scream.
Thirsty?
Let me illuminate to you the precarious situation in which you have found yourself.
I am the one they call when things go wrong and things have indeed gone wrong.
My friends need to be punished.
Call me next time you' re left here alone.
Yep.
ln case you' re wondering, this did not go well.
You have three days to change my mind.
- Blah.
- Eww!
Lilo!
Why didn' t you wait at the school?
You were supposed to wait there!
Lilo!
Do you not understand?
Do you want to be taken away?
Answer me!
No!
No, you don' t understand?
No!
No, what?
No!
You' re such a pain!
So why don' t you sell me and buy a rabbit instead?!
At least a rabbit would behave better than you!
Go ahead!
Then you' il be happy because it' il be smarter than me, too!
And quieter!
You' il like it, 'cause it' s stinky, like you!
I' m already in my room!
Hey.
I brought you some pizza, in case you were hungry.
We' re a broken family, aren' t we?
No.
Maybe, a little.
Maybe a lot.
I shouldn' t have yelled at you.
We' re sisters.
It' s our job.
Yeah, well, from now on...
I like you better as a sister than a mom.
Yeah?
And you like me better as a sister than a rabbit, right?
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Yes.
Yes, I do.
I hit Mertle Edmonds today.
You hit her?
Before I bit her.
You bit her.
Lilo, you shouldn' t...
People treat me different.
They just don' t know what to say.
lf you promise not to fight anymore
I promise not to yell at you, except on special occasions.
Tuesdays and bank holidays would be good.
Yeah?
Would that be good?
My camera' s full again.
Aren' t they beautiful?
A falling star!
I call it!
Get out!
I have to make a wish!
Can' t you go any faster?
Gravity is increasing on me.
No, it' s not!
It is, too, Lilo.
The same thing happened yesterday.
You rotten sister!
Your butt is crushing me!
Why do you act so weird?!
I need someone to be my friend... someone who won' t run away.
Maybe send me an angel... the nicest angel you have.
What we when hit?
There it is.
It stay jammed under the fender.
We better call somebody.
We' re looking for something that can defend itself... something that won' t die... something sturdy, you know?
Like a lobster.
Lilo, you lolo.
Do we have a lobster door?
We have a dog door.
We are getting a dog.
So nice to see your pretty face again!
Jumba?
We need your name and address at the bottom of the form...
The kennel' s back this way.
Go.
Pick someone out.
Hello?
Hello?!
Are there any "aminals" in here?
Hello!
Hi.
Hoh... ha...
Hi...
Wow!
Oh, yes.
All of our dogs are adoptable.
Except that one!
What is that thing?!
A dog, I think.
But it was dead this morning.
It was dead this morning?!
It was hit by a truck.
I like him!
Come here, boy.
Oh!
Wouldn' t you like a different dog?
We have better dogs, dear.
Not better than him.
He can talk!
Say hello.
He...
Hel...
Dogs can' t talk, dear.
He did.
Does it have to be this dog?
Yes, he' s good.
I can tell.
You' il have to think of a name for him.
His name is...
Stitch.
Now, that' s not a real name...
Hmm.
Uh- uh, uh- uh- uh.... in lceland... but here, it' s a good name.
Stitch it is.
And there' s a two- dollar license fee.
I want to buy him!
Can I borrow two dollars?
He' s all yours.
You' re all mine.
Well, what' s he doing?
Shh!
Keep quiet.
He' s listening for us.
How good is his hearing?
I mean, can he...?
Why don' t you run?
Coming!
I' m coming!
Stop!
I have just determined this situation to be far too hazardous!
Don' t worry, I won' t hit her.
That girl is a part of the mosquito food chain.
Here!
Educate yourself.
Using a little girl for a shield.
This is low, even for you!
Whoo- hoo!
Bah!
Tear him apart with all both my bare hands!
Have you lost your mind?!
What is it, Stitch?
We cannot be seen!
Bad dog, barking at nothing!
You can' t shoot, and you can' t be seen.
Look at you!
You look like a monster.
We have to blend in.
Okay, I got to get to work.
Stick around town and stay out of the roads, okay?
I' il meet you at 1: 00.
Hmm?
Oh!
Ah!
Okay, I guess we should be going.
What about Stitch?
My friends!
What do you want?
I' m sorry I bit you and pulled your hair and punched you in the face.
Apology not accepted.
Now get out of my way before I run you over.
His name is Stitch.
That is the ugliest thing I have ever saw.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Get it away from me!
I' m gonna get a disease!
Somebody do something!
Oh, great!
He' s loose.
His destructive programming is taking effect.
He will be irresistibly drawn to large cities where he will back up sewers reverse street signs and steal everyone' s left shoe.
It' s nice to live on an island with no large cities.
Are you okay?
No, siree, uh- uh...
Hey, over here, little buddy.
When you' re ready to give up, just let us know, heh?
Whee!
Yeah!
This is you.
This is your badness level.
It' s unusually high for someone your size.
We have to fix that.
Ay- yi- yi, Lilo!
Your dog cannot sit at the table.
Stitch is troubled.
He needs desserts.
Oh, you didn' t even eat your sweet potato.
I thought you liked them.
Desserts!
David!
I got a new dog.
You sure it' s a dog?
Uh- huh.
He used to be a collie before he got ran over.
Yum!
Hey...
Blah!
Eww!
Howzit, Nani?
Did you catch fire again?
Nah, just the stage.
Listen, I was wondering if you' re not doing anything this...
David, I told you, I can' t.
I got a lot to deal with right now.
I just figured you might need some time...
You smell like a lawn mower.
Look, I got to go.
The kid at table three' s throwing poi again.
Maybe some other time, okay?
Don' t worry.
She likes your butt and fancy hair.
I read her diary.
She thinks it' s fancy?
Blech!
Oh!
Mmm!
Look what I find!
Get restraints!
Right.
Take that!
Hurry!
Uh, hold still just a...
Aah!
Hey, Nani!
ls that your dog?
Uh...
All is well.
Please, go about your business.
Oh, your head looks swollen.
Actually, she' s just ugly.
Darling...
He' s joking.
Ugly -- look at me...
Uh, this is not working out.
Uh, b- but...
Mm- mm.
Yeah?
Well, who wants to work at this stupid... fakey luau anyway.
Come on, Lilo.
Did you lose your job because of Stitch and me?
The manager' s a vampire and he wanted me to join his legion of the undead.
I knew it.
This is a great home.
You' il like it a lot.
See?
Uh, Lilo...
Comfy.
- Hey!
What is the matter with you?
Be careful of the little angel!
It' s not an angel, Lilo.
I don' t even think it' s a dog.
We just have to take him back.
He' s just cranky because it' s his bedtime.
He' s creepy, Lilo.
I won' t sleep while he' s loose in the house.
You' re loose in the house all the time and I sleep just fine!
Hey, what are you doing?
Stop that, Stitch!
Hey!
Look at him, Lilo.
He' s obviously mutated from something else.
We have to take him back.
He was an orphan and we adopted him!
What about "O' hana"?
He hasn' t been here that long.
Neither have l.
Dad said O' hana means family.
Huh?
O' hana means family.
Family means...... nobody gets left behind.
Or...?
Or forgotten.
I know.
I hate it when you use O' hana against me.
Mmm.
Don' t worry, you can sleep right next to me.
Look how curious the puppy is.
This is my room, and this is your bed.
This is your dolly and bottle.
See?
Doesn' t spill.
I filled it with coffee.
Good puppy.
Now get into bed.
Hey!
That' s mine!
Down!
Mmm!
Be careful of that!
You don' t touch this!
Don' t ever touch it!
Don' t pull on her head!
She' s recovering from surgery.
No!
That' s from my blue period.
Mmm...
There.
You know, you wreck everything you touch.
Why not try and make something for a change?
Ah!
San Francisco.
Save me!
Eek!
This little girl is wasting her time.
6- 2- 6 cannot be taught to ignore its destructive programming.
Ooh!
Push that over.
Nothing!
Uh, say, I want to try it on.
No!
Share!
Let me try it!
Hey!
You' re just jealous' cause I' m pretty!
Don' t move.
A mosquito has chosen me as her perch.
She' s so beautiful.
And another one!
Why, it' s a whole flock.
And they like me!
They' re nuzzling my flesh with their noses.
Now they' re, um, they' re....
I think it might be a koala.
An evil koala.
I can' t even pet it.
It keeps staring at me, like it' s going to eat me.
Hello?
Nani?
Hello?
Are you there?
Now, this is interesting.
What?
6- 2- 6 was designed to be a monster but now he has nothing to destroy.
You see, I never gave him a greater purpose.
What must it be like to have nothing... not even memories to visit in the middle of the night?
Nah!
Hmm.
Hmm...
That' s the Ugly Duckling.
He' s sad because he' s all alone and nobody wants him but on this page, his family hears him crying and they find him.
Then the Ugly Duckling is happy because he knows where he belongs.
Hmm...
Want to listen to the King?
You look like an Elvis fan.
Nani.
Nani!
Uh... yeah?
Look.
Heard you lost your job.
Well, uh, actually, I just quit that job because, you know, the hours are just not conducive to the challenges of raising a child...
I am so sorry about that.
What is that thing?
That' s my puppy.
Really?
Thus far, you have been adrift in the sheltered harbour of my patience but I cannot ignore you being jobless.
Do I make myself clear?
Perfectly.
I expect it to be a model citizen... capisce?
Uh... yes?
New job.
Model citizen.
Good day.
Mrs. Hasagawa?
I' m here to answer your newspaper ad.
Elvis Presley was a model citizen.
I' ve compiled a list of his traits for you to practise.
Number one is dancing.
I can' t talk now, dear.
I' m waiting for someone to answer my ad.
That' s why I' m here.
Hands on your hips.
Now follow my lead.
Ooh- hoo.
You fooled me with your kisses...
That' s my want ad.
I know!
You' re not the way...
Why is everything so dark?
I am all about coffee.
Let' s move on to step two.
Elvis played guitar.
Hold it like this, and put your fingers here.
See?
Now you try.
... and I make great cappuccinos and lattes with...
I wish I could, Nani, but I just hired Teddy and with tourist season ending...
Concierge- er- ing is my life.
This is the face of romance.
She looks like she could use some lovin '.
Oh, we might have something.
Good.
Now kiss her.
I' m sure Elvis had his bad days, too.
I' m all about saving people?
Actually, I do think we have an opening.
Really?
Okay, this is it.
Time to bring it all together.
Oh, that' d be so great!
You have no idea how badly I need this job.
Knock 'em dead!
Hey, knock it off!
Hey, Lilo!
Howzit...
Nani?
We' ve been having a bad day.
Hmm...
Hey, I might not be a doctor but I know that there' s no better cure for a sour face than a couple of boards and some choice waves.
What you think?
I think that' s a great idea.
Oh, can' t complain, Mom.
I' m camping out with a convicted criminal and, uh... oh, I had my head chewed on by a monster!
6- 2- 6 is returning willingly to water.
Oh, hold on, Mom -- another call.
Mr. Pleakley, you are overdue.
I want a status report.
Oh, uh, things are going well.
He cannot swim!
Things are going well.
Jumba, aren' t they going well?
Why will he risk drowning?
Jumba?
Jumba, help me out here.
I would have expected you back by now, with 6- 2- 6 in hand.
Just a few things left to pack and, uh, we' il be...
Hang up.
We are going swimming.
Lilo!
Oh... some lolo must have stuffed us in the barrel.
Where' s Stitch?
Get off of her!
What happened?
Stitch dragged her down.
We lost Stitch!
Lilo?
Lilo, look at me.
Look at me, baby.
No.
He' s unconscious, but I think he' s alive.
David, take Lilo.
This isn' t what it looks like.
We were...
lt- It' s just that...
I know you' re trying, Nani but you need to think about what' s best for Lilo... even if it removes you from the picture.
I' il be back tomorrow morning for Lilo.
I' m sorry.
Nani?
ls there something I can do?
No, David.
Uh, I need to take Lilo home now.
We have a lot to talk about, Lilo.
Thanks.
You know, I really believed they had a chance.
Then you came along.
Lilo, honey... we have to, uh...
Don' t worry.
You' re nice, and someone will give you a job.
I would.
Come here.
That' s us before...
It was rainy, and they went for a drive.
What happened to yours?
I hear you cry at night.
Do you dream about them?
I know that' s why you wreck things and push me.
Our family' s little now and we don' t have many toys but if you want, you could be part of it.
You could be our baby and we' d raise you to be good.
"O' hana" means family.
"Family" means nobody gets left behind but if you want to leave, you can.
I' il remember you, though.
I remember everyone that leaves.
L...
L...
Lost.
I' m lost.
Help!
I don' t like the ocean!
Oh, look, a friendly little dolphin.
They helped sailors in the war...
It' s a shark!
It' s a shark, and it ain' t friendly!
It looks like a dolphin.
Tricky fish!
Oh, octopus, come and help me?
An octo... octopus is worse than a shark!
I hate this planet!
little monster!
Uh, Agent Pleakley here.
I have lost patience with you both.
Have you captured 6- 2- 6 or not?
Um...
Uh, uh...
Consider yourselves fired and prison- bound.
Your incompetence is nothing short of unspeakable!
But, uh... mm...
We' re fired!
Now we do it my way!
Your way?
It seems I have overestimated Jumber and Blinkley.
Uh, Jumba and Pleakley.
Whatever.
The mission is in jeopardy.
This could be your chance to redeem yourself, Captain Gantu.
How soon will you be prepared to leave?
lmmediately.
Don' t run.
Don' t make me shoot you.
You were expensive.
Yes, that' s it.
Come quietly.
Mm... waiting.
For what?
Family.
Ah!
You don' t have one.
I made you.
Oh... maybe I could...
You' re built to destroy.
You can never belong.
Now come quietly and we will take you apart.
No, no, no, no, don' t, don' t run!
Don' t run!
Lilo.
I didn' t hear you get up.
Baby, what' s wrong?
Stitch left.
Really?
It' s good he' s gone.
He didn' t want to be here, anyway.
We don' t need him.
Lilo... sometimes you try your hardest but things don' t work out the way you want them to.
Sometimes things have to change and maybe sometimes they' re for the better... even if...
Nani!
David!
I think I found you a job.
You what?!
Old man Kukhkini' s store but we got to hurry.
Oh, um, okay.
Lilo?
Baby, this is really important.
I need you to stay here for a few minutes.
I' m going to be right back.
Lock the door and don' t answer it for anyone, okay?
Things are finally turning around.
Aw, David, I owe you one.
That' s okay.
You can just date me, and we' il call it even.
Come back here, you little...!
Stitch?
What is it?
Shh!
Oh, hiding behind your little friend won' t work anymore.
Didn' t I tell you?
New rules.
Ha!
Ooh.
Oh, ooh!
Ow!
Ow!
What are we going to do?
Cryin 'all the time...
I love this song!
Pliers.
Check.
Come out, my friend from whomever you' re hiding behind.
What the...?
Ooh!
Come on!
What' s the big deal?
I' il put you back together again.
I' il make you taller and not so fluffy!
I like fluffy!
No...
No...
No!
Oh, leave my mother out of this!
You could do with a makeover.
I tried to give you my good looks but let' s face it, something went wrong.
No!
Quick!
lf we make it to...
You' re alive!
They' re all over the place!
let me stop you.
You always get in way!
Where' s the girl?
What have you done to the girl?
Cobra Bubbles?
Aliens are attacking my house.
No, no, no!
Blue punch buggy!
No punch back.
There' s no need to alert the authorities.
Everything' s under control.
Lilo, who was that?
Oh, good, my dog found the chain saw.
Don' t hang...!
Ha!
You shouldn' t play with guns.
Oh, okay.
Thank you.
It' s your birthday!
Happy birthday!
Merry Christmas!
It' s not Christmas.
Happy Hanukkah!
We' re leaving Stitch?
Trust me.
This is not going to end well.
- One potato.
- Two potato.
- Three potato.
- Five potato.
- Six potato.
Seven potato, more.
My... mother... told... me... you... are... it.
Oh, I win!
Thanks.
Mahalo plenty.
You won' t be disappointed.
I' il show up early to help with the morning deliver...
Oh, don' t turn left.
No.
One of them had a giant eye in the middle of his face.
Oh, Lilo!
Please... don' t do this.
You know I have no choice.
No!
You' re not taking her!
I' m the only one who understands her!
You take that away, she won' t stand a chance!
You' re making this harder than it needs to be.
You don' t know what you' re doing!
ls this what she needs?!
It seems clear to me that you need her a lot more than she needs you.
Lilo!
Lilo!
- Lilo!
- Lilo!
Lilo!
- Lilo!
- Lilo!
You ruined everything.
You' re one of them?
Ooh!
Get out of here, Stitch.
Surprise!
And here I thought you' d be difficult to catch.
Ho- ho- ho.
Silly me.
Lilo?
Lilo!
There you go, all buckled up for the trip.
And look -- I even caught you a little snack.
No!
Stop!
Lilo.
Aah!
Okay, talk.
I know you had something to do with this.
Now where is Lilo?
I know you can.
Okay, okay.
Where' s Lilo?
Lilo...
Now all your washing is up!
You' re under arrest!
Read him his rights.
Listen carefully.
Galactic Command?
Experiment 6- 2- 6 is in custody.
We' il wait right here.
Huh?
Don' t interact with her.
Where' s Lilo?
Who?
What?!
Lilo... my sister.
Uh, sorry, we do not know anyone by this, uh...
She' s a little girl -- this big!
She has black hair and brown eyes and she hangs around with that thing!
Uh...
We know her.
Bring her back.
Oh, we can' t do that.
Uh- uh.
That would be a misuse of Galactic resources.
See, problem is... we' re just here for him.
So she' s gone?
Look at the bright side.
You won' t have to yell at anyone anymore.
Come.
O' hana.
Huh?
Hey!
Get away from her.
What did you say?
O' hana means family.
Family means...... nobody gets left behind.
Or forgotten.
Yeah.
Hey...
What?!
After all you put me through you expect me to help you just like that?!
Just like that?!
Ih.
Fine.
Fine?
You' re doing what he says?
Uh, he' s very persuasive.
Persuasive?!
What exactly are we doing?
Rescue.
We' re going to get Lilo?
Ih.
Oh, good!
I was hoping to add theft, endangerment and insanity to my list of things I did today.
You, too?
Oh!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
What?
This is Gantu, requesting hyperspace clearance.
Stand by for clearance.
Clearance is granted on vector C- 12.
Connect me to the Grand Councilwoman.
Gantu, what' s going on?
I thought you' d like to know that the little abomination is... is...
Yes, Captain?
I' il call you back.
How did you get out of there?
So what exactly are we doing?
Don' t worry, is all part of plan.
We are professionals.
Hey!
Get that out of your mouth!
Hold on!
Okay, is show time!
This is it!
Go!
Go!
Little savage!
Get off my ship!
Stitch!
Computer, locate Experiment 6- 2- 6.
6- 2- 6 located.
We finish this now.
Stitch is unconscious.
What do we do now?
We stay close.
Hope for a miracle.
That' s all we can do.
No!
Don' t leave me, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Target 6- 2- 6 is in motion.
Speed is 84.
lmpossible!
Stitch!
Hmm?
Abomination.
Stupidhead.
Yee- haw!
Aloha!
You' re foul!
You' re flawed!
Also cute and fluffy!
You came back.
Nobody gets left behind.
Lilo!
Good dog.
Auwe!
David!
Hey, Lilo.
Can you give us a ride to shore?
Uh...
Sure!
But I have to make two trips.
So you' re from outer space, huh?
I heard the surfing' s choice.
We have 6- 2- 6.
Take him to my ship.
Leave him alone.
Hold on.
Grand Councilwoman, let me explain.
Silence!
I am retiring you, Captain Gantu.
Goes to me.
You' il be lucky if you end up on a Fluff Trog farm after we sort this thing out.
Uh...
I think I should...
You!
You' re the cause of all this!
lf it wasn' t for your Experiment 6- 2- 6 none of this...
Stitch.
What?
My name Stitch.
Stitch, then.
lf it wasn' t for Stitch....
Does Stitch have to go in the ship?
Yes.
Can Stitch say good- bye?
Yes.
Thank you.
Who are you?
This is my family.
It' s little and broken... but still good.
Yeah.
Still good.
Does he really have to go?
You know as well as I that our laws are absolute.
I cannot change what the Council has decided.
Lilo, didn' t you buy that thing at the shelter?
Hey!
Three days ago, I bought Stitch at the shelter.
I paid two dollars for him.
See this stamp?
lf you take him you' re stealing.
Aliens are all about rules.
You look familiar.
1973.
Ah, yes.
You had hair then.
Take note of this.
This creature has been sentenced to life in exile a sentence that shall be henceforth served out here... on Earth... and as caretaker of the alien life- form, Stitch this family is now under the official protection of the United Galactic Federation.
We' il be checking in now and then.
I was afraid you were going to say that.
This won' t be easy to explain back at headquarters.
I know what you mean.
Don' t let those two get on my ship.
ClA?
Former.
Saved the planet once.
Convinced an alien race that mosquitoes were an endangered species.
Now, about your house....
Wait.
Some say juvenile.
I say genius!
Leave me alone!
Matt, I' m getting ready for graduation!
Matt!
Say goodbye to your little toy.
And say hello to Matt owning his big sister for eternity!
Never give up

You give me something to believe in
I know the way that I want it to be
I' m gonna make it happen somehow
A moment' s pain for a lifetime of pleasure
The tide is high...
I shall win the Academy Award!
Yesterday, you were in diapers, and now you' re graduating junior high.
You' re growing up, and I can' t believe you' re going to Rome for two weeks all by yourself.
Without me.
Without me there with you.
Without me with you there.
You there without me.
Mom, that' s about all the combinations of those words you can make.
Lizzie, this is a big day for you, sweetheart.
He' s going to quote a dead guy.
As William Shakespeare wrote, "Be not afraid of greatness: some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them."
Thanks, Dad, but I' m just trying to get through graduation.
Greatness can wait till this nightmare' s over.
Hey, Gordo.
So, do I look okay?
I' m your guy best friend.
You should talk to Miranda about this.
But she' s in Mexico City.
Yes.
Your blue robe looks way cooler than all the other girls'.
Oh... my... God.
Only you would think you could hide that powder - blue, puffy- sleeved, it' s- kind- of- a- peasant- dress - but- it- might- just- be - a- baggy - disaster that you wore to the spring dance.
Lizzie McGuire, you are an outfit repeater!
But I...
Maybe I' m an outfit repeater, but you' re an outfit rememberer, which is just as pathetic.
Does she not have anything better to do than make my life miserable?
I mean... we used to be best friends.
But that was before she became popular.
McGuire!
Go.
Hey, Mr. Escobar.
Nice after- shave.
Oh, thank you.
Margaret Chan either has ebola or a very bad cold.
In any event, you' re up.
U- U- Up where?
At the podium.
You are going to deliver the class president' s speech.
B- But what about the vice president?
He' s not graduating.
The secretary treasurer' s next in line.
All I did was handle petty cash.
I' m sorry, but you' re not buying your way out of this.
I want you to deliver your speech with as much pride and commitment as Margaret Chan would, even though you' re no Margaret Chan.
You' re no Margaret Chan.
Run!
Ladies and gentlemen, uh, Lizzie McGuire.
U- Uh, Margaret Chan couldn' t make it tonight, so I' m going - I' m going to be filling in for her.
Not that any of us could really do that, but, um, anyway...
Honey, I' m losing the feeling in my knuckles.
I think that we can all agree that junior high is filled with embarrassing and awkward and sometimes just downright humiliating moments, right?
Me neither.
It is so sad.
It' s like watching one of those animals get killed on the Discovery Channel.
I- I think Margaret Chan would want me to have some water right now.
Play something!
Do something!
Ha ha ha!
Come on!
Dad!
I' ve got to get out of the country!
I know you' re still upset, but it wasn' t that bad.
Oh, really, Mom?
Was your junior- high graduation on "Good Morning America"?
What creep would send Diane Sawyer a video to embarrass you like that?
What is that?
That is Miss Ungermeyer.
She' s gonna be our principal for the next four years.
If you stay on her good side, it' s a one- way ticket to an lvy League school.
What if you' re on her bad side?
Excuse me!
I need to mop up some puke.
Well, you...
You wind up as that guy?
No.
You end up working for that guy.
Can you make sure there are no garlic or soy products in anything Brittany puts near her mouth?
Miss Ungermeyer, Luke has tennis elbow.
Could somebody carry his luggage?
My son has asthma, and he must have his puffer.
Brittany, she' s got allergies.
Attention, parents... shut your pie holes.
I' m on a mission here to drag your progeny to 31 historically significant Roman landmarks in two weeks.
Now, when these back- talking miscreants return to you, they will have dipped their toes in a lake of culture, before assuming their destiny folding shirts at the outlet mall.
Many - actually, most - of your classmates opted for the 36- hour bus ride to the Water- slide Wonderland.
But you... you, who are not mouth - breathing trailer trash, you will get to experience the delights of la citta eterna!
Rome.
The eternal city.
Did no one read the info packets?
Watch and learn.
Um, Miss Ungermeyer,
I just wanted to let you know I' m really looking forward to this exciting and academically enriching trip.
What' s your name?
David Gordon.
- Mm- hmm.
I think, in ltalian, that means a sneaky brownnoser with a hidden agenda, huh?
Yeah!
Come on, check those bags!
I want to see that junk in the trunk and a seat looking neat.
Okay.
Mom...
Okay, it' s only two weeks, Mom.
- Honey, she' s got to go.
- Two weeks.
- Bye.
- Safe trip, huh?
- Okay.
Sweetheart...
- Mm- hmm.
Flight 72 to Rome.
Final boarding, Flight 72 to Rome.
Hey!
We' re going to the land where they invented spaghetti!
Kate and all the little teeth - whitening friends who' d be ragging on me for messing up graduation went to Water- slide Wonderland.
How many Lizzies does it take to screw in a light bulb?
I don' t know, but it only takes one to screw up a graduation.
Hey.
Zip it.
Down each avenue or via, street or strata
On an evening in Roma
Do they take 'em for espresso?
Yeah, I guess so
On each lover' s arm, a girl I wish I knew
On an evening in Roma
So please meet me in the plaza near your casa
I am only one, and that is one too few
On an evening in Roma
But in Rome, do as the Romans do
Will you?
- On an evening in Roma
Here we are.
Step right up.
Number one...
Number two...
Welcome to the Hotel Cambini.
Lest you think there are many of you and less of me and it will therefore be easy to pull anything over on me, think again.
I' ve also enlisted a little help.
The assistant manager of the hotel, Giorgio Averni, was a commander in the ltalian Navy and is therefore as up on his game as I am mine.
Giorgio, would you like to brief my students on the security procedures of the hotel?
We serve at 5: 00.
The cookies.
Yeah.
You heard the man.
Room assignments.
David Gordon... you will be rooming with Ethan Craft.
You' il be in Room 103.
Are those English or ltalian numbers?
You got a problem with that?
Um, no, ma' am.
Any room is just - just fine for me.
Being a spineless jellyfish is almost as unattractive as being a little brownnoser.
McGuire!
Seeing as how Margaret Chan was unable to make the trip, you will be rooming with...
Okay, I am not, under any circumstances, sharing a room with -
I' il be taking the bed by the window.
You don' t mind, do you?
Uh, ye- e- e- e- s!
No.
I sleep much better with the Swiss eiderdown.
I wanted to let you know I understand you want to put all that embarrassing stuff behind you and just move on and have a fresh start.
You do?
Yes.
I understand your dream.
It' s a big dream.
It' s a huge dream, and you can' t do it alone.
In fact, I don' t think you can do it at all.
Let it go.
Lizzie, come on.
Whoa!
Gordo, what?
Don' t worry.
Where are we going?
Look.
Pretty cool, huh?
You know what, Gordo?
I' m not gonna let Kate Sanders get to me.
Promise me something.
Anything.
Promise that when we' re here, we' il find adventures.
All right?
This is our chance to start over.
I mean, do anything that we want to do.
Yeah.
I- I know.
You' re right.
You and me.
Adventures.
Deal.
Deal.
The Trevi Fountain was designed by Gian Lorenza Bernini and Peitro da Cortona in the 17th century.
And it took about 100 years to finish this bad boy.
Throughout history, people have come from all over the world to make a wish and toss their coin in the Trevi Fountain.
Those people are suckers.
You got to make your own luck in this world.
All right, moving on, people.
Let' s go.
Scusi,
Grazie.
Scusi, Grazie,
You know what?
Forget what she says.
Make a wish.
I' m in Rome with my best friend.
I' m good.
You make one.
Okay.
Okay.
lsabella?
Huh?
Okay, I was wishing for smooth sailing through high school, but this will work.
Uh, I' m sorry.
It' s just you look an awful lot like a friend of mine.
Paolo, you have to get to your photo shoot.
We got to go.
What you little halflings are feeling right about now is your energy flagging.
We got four more stops today.
I want you to at least be able to shuffle from monument to monument.
We got one word for that, and it' s gelato.
Keep in mind that ltalian ice cream has about twice the sugar of American ice cream.
Means you' re gonna want about two scoops, huh?
I know I do.
All right.
I don' t mean to bother you.
I' m Paolo.
Paolo Valisari.
Oh, um, I' m Lizzie McGuire, and this is my friend Gordo.
This is my friend Sergei.
Sergei, doesn' t she look exactly like lsabella?
- lsabella!
- Paolo!
Paolo!
lsabella!
Isabella!
Paolo!
Paolo!
Ciao, Paolo!
Wow!
That really does look like me.
Except for the hair, you could be her twin.
Isabella is my singing partner, and you' re like her sister.
Like two pods in a pea.
Lizzie, can I see you again?
Maybe tomorrow?
Please?
What' s the word for "yes" in ltalian?
- Si,
No, I' m -
It' s okay.
I can cover for you.
Head check!
I' m sorry.
I' m here with my school, so I can' t.
Forgive me if I embarrassed you.
Some people, when they come to Rome, they want to find adventure.
Oh, it' s okay.
I got some cool cheese.
Did you just say "cool cheese"?
Paolo...
We must go.
I will meet you tomorrow morning at the Trevi Fountain at 9: 00.
Hey, Gordon, McGuire, did you not hear me say "head check"?
15, 16.
Who are you?
Paolo Valisari.
Put your money in your front pockets.
She makes me very scared.
Join the club.
Lizzie...
Ci vediamo,
What does that mean?
We will see each other.
Hey.
This Paolo and lsabella CD isn' t so bad.
I- never- go- out - and- my- life' s- a- black- hole - of- depression kind of thing, you' d think they stink.
Ioving- life kind of thing, they' re good.
Here.
Listen.
You don' t have to sail the ocean
Yeah, not bad.
You use scented soap, huh?
What?
Um, it - N- Never - never mind.
So, Paolo wants me to meet him at the Trevi Fountain tomorrow.
So go.
That would mean I would have to sneak away from the group.
So?
I' m incapable of sneaking.
Weren' t you the one that said we were gonna have adventures on this trip?
We.
We were going to have adventures.
And we will.
It just so happens that you have dibs on the first one.
Okay.
Just as long as we don' t do anything that would get us tossed on a plane home.
Lizzie, are - are you feeling okay?
Is this girl sick, or isn' t she?
She doesn' t have a fever, and yet she' s in bed.
Ask yourself why a beautiful young girl on her first visit to Rome, probably seeking adventure, wants to lie in bed all day.
She' s ill.
I heard she fell down at graduation, made a complete fool out of herself.
I saw that on CNN.
CNN?
Often, the nervous system collapses after that type of humiliation.
Do you have any recommendations?
This young woman should stay in bed.
Uh, she - she should also eat two apricots.
Oh, for digestion or...
No, they' re in season.
Very delicious.
Feel better, Signorina McGuire.
You rest up, McGuire.
Don' t want you to miss all the adventures of Rome.
Uh, doctor, I have a boil...
Sorry.
Uno, due, tre,
- Tre, - Tre,
Bene,
I- I just - I had them all wish for you to come.
I don' t have much time.
You know my chaperon -
Wait, wait, wait.
I have to show you something.
Is a valley of heartaches and tears
- Come on.
And in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears
But you and I have a love always there to remind us...
You should see Rome the way Romans do.
So you knew that I would come.
I hoped you would.
Are you sure you know how to drive this thing?
This is Rome.
Nobody knows how to drive.
Away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
And the rainbow together we' il find
Volare
Cantare
Volare
Cantare
No wonder my happy heart sings
Your love has given me wings
No wonder my happy heart sings
Your love has given me wings
I don' t know what catastrophe is going to happen in Rome, but with Lizzie there, something will.
What are you going to do with that information?
Give it away, like you did with the graduation video?
Hey!
She was really freaked out by that.
And you have what to show for it?
The pride of a job well done?
Try buying a PS2 with the pride of a job well done.
Matt, Matt, Matt.
We' ve been over this before.
Cash up front.
Melina, are you staying for dinner?
- I' d love to, Mrs. McGuire.
- Great.
We' il need extra energy to work on our summer reading list.
In that case, I' il make brownies.
I' ve said it before.
You' re weak.
Weak!
Don' t do anything without consulting me first.
You rock.
Hey, Paolo, can I ask you something?
Si, carina,
Um, I know that our lives are a little different.
Actually, like, several universes different.
But doesn' t Sergei get tired of following us around?
Actually, Sergei' s my bodyguard.
So, you see, between me and Sergei, you' il always be safe.
How famous do you have to be before you need a bodyguard?
Paolo, go!
Go!
I- It' s Miss Ungermeyer!
It' s our bus!
- Go!
- I cannot.
Miss Ungermeyer, didn' t we just pass the Castel Sant' Angelo?
Yep.
What about it?
I just noticed it' s not on our itinerary.
That is correct.
Well, s- shouldn' t it be?
I- I mean, it was a papal residence and it does contain frescoes from artists influenced by the school of Raphael.
What are you up to, Gordon?
N- N- Nothing.
I- I just figure that, while in Rome, we should be exposed to as much Renaissance, Raphaelite work typified by chiaroscuro and Hellenic mythical imagery as humanly possible.
Ah, Gordon, you are on the list, and the list is not a place you want to be.
What is this?
Only in Rome, huh?
You know how to move that, or you want me to do it for you?
What are you looking at?
Want a piece of that, a piece of the Ungermeyer?
Over there by that statue.
You see it?
Yeah.
That' s where the artist Caravaggio had his opponent burned at the stake.
Or was it the pope who had Caravaggio burned at the stake?
Either way, this neighborhood was tough.
Paolo...
Si, carina?
Do you still love her?
Who?
Isabella?
Si,
Of course I still love her.
But like a sister.
So, why did you break up?
It' s, um, it' s complicated.
- What?
But I want to do more serious music.
And when I told this to lsabella, she said flat- out "no."
This will be our last CD together. "
Did she totally freak out?
She totally freak out.
I feel awful about that, but what about me?
I need to grow as an artist.
Yeah.
I just - I don' t know, I had this crazy -
I just - I don' t know.
W- What?
I had this crazy idea that maybe you could help me.
How crazy could it be?
Just tell me.
No, I can' t.
It' s too - It' s too...
- Please.
- Okay.
Isabella and I are supposed to present an award together at the International Music Video Awards.
Cool!
I- I mean, cool for regular people like me, but for you, I guess it' s like work.
No, no, no.
It' s cool for me, too.
You get all kinds of free stuff.
But now because lsabella' s so mad at me, she' s refusing to appear.
The record company' s threatening to sue if she doesn' t show up.
What about you?
For me is no problem.
I write the music.
I don' t know where it comes from.
It just comes from me.
See?
So I can go solo.
She needs the help to sing.
You mean lsabella lip- synchs?
Promise me you will speak of this to no one.
Imagine what would happen to lsabella' s career.
You still care about her.
You' re definitely broken up, right?
I got my crazy idea that maybe you could pretend to be lsabella and present the award with me onstage.
Present an award?
O- Onstage?
In front of an audience?
I- I- I' m really not good in front of crowds.
I could never do that.
Of course you can do it.
You are magnifico.
I don' t know ltalian, but I know what that means.
I don' t know, Paolo.
I...
Don' t worry, carina,
I could never ask you to do this crazy thing.
No.
You know what?
You don' t have to ask.
If this is gonna help you and lsabella, then...... I' il do it.
Grazie!
Prego!
Head check!
Gordo.
Gordo.
You, Lizzie McGuire, are actually presenting an award at the lMVAs with Paolo?
No.
Me lsabella with Paolo.
- What?
- It' s a long story.
I' m doing it because lsabella won' t.
You' re gonna get up onstage in front of all these people?
That' s the great thing.
It' s not gonna be me.
It' s Paolo' s idea to help lsabella because he still loves her.
Like a sister.
He is so amazing.
And he' s 17!
For being so famous and used to getting everything that you want, he' s just - he' s just so kind.
For real?
That' s a lot to say about someone just knowing them a day.
I- I know that.
But I feel like I' ve known him my whole life.
I just wanted to come by and thank you.
I had the most magical day of my life.
It wouldn' t have happened if it weren' t for you.
It was that good, huh?
You' re such a good friend.
The sting.
What sting?
You want a little mano a mano?
See, this is one of the reasons me and you aren' t friends.
I never have any idea what you' re talking about.
Some dudes get the approach.
Others, the sting.
That ltalian dude.
He' s big- time approach.
I actually feel my brain turning into goo.
Embrace the sting.
That' s what you' re vibin 'from Lizzie.
Wait a minute.
Now, you actually think that I' m jealous of Paolo?
Word.
Oh, no.
No, see, that would mean that I like Lizzie as more than a friend.
You and I have trouble communicating?
You' re wrong, man.
Whoa!
This girl looks freakishly like my sister!
- Ow.
- Zoom!
Zoom!
Another freakish coincidence.
I mean, she has the same necklace as my sister' s.
Why do we even pretend you' re in charge?
- Let' s see what this says.
"lsabella goes blond.
Italian pop duo Paolo and lsabella wowed the crowd outside a shop near the Trevi Fountain, showing off lsabella' s new blond hair. "
They must think that Lizzie is this famous singer!
And if I show this to my mom, Lizzie will be so busted!
If you show this to your mom, it' s worth nothing.
But if you show this to the ltalian tabloids, we will be rolling in cash, my friend.
Interesting!
"We"?
Not up to toughing it out on the streets with us?
I could try, Miss Ungermeyer.
No, I just hate seeing you being denied the cultural experience of being in a foreign country.
You missed seven points of historical significance yesterday.
I know.
It' s really killing me too, Miss Ungermeyer.
Which is why I thought I' d bring you something to help ease the pain, hmm?
Mmh, well, that' s really thoughtful of you.
Seeing as how your teeny - tiny little body doesn' t have the strength, we' re gonna have to let your mind do the wandering.
"The Rise and Decline of the Roman Empire," hmm?
I' d like one report on the rise and one on the decline.
If I didn' t have a headache a minute ago, I do now.
You don' t have a problem with that, do you?
Um, no.
- What else do I have to do?
Take a crazy chance?
Do a crazy dance?
You might lose a lot
So why not?
Why not?
Why not take a crazy chance?
I am so grateful for your help.
You' re doing a very kind thing for lsabella.
Uh, Paolo, where are we?
Via Condotti.
One of the most expensive shopping districts in the world.
We must find you the perfect outfit.
Oh, hey, lsabella, Paolo!
Ciao!
Your hair is so blond and, uh, innocent.
- Um...
The island we were on was really, really sunny, so it was j- just the sun.
We must get sun, too, no?
Ciao, bella!
Ciao, Ciao, Ciao.
They are so tall!
- They all want to be you.
- They want to be lsabella.
Sit and I' il get Franca.
I will just be a moment.
Take your time.
I' il just be sitting here in heaven.
Hard as it is to imagine, as we look at the ruins of the Forum, that this was once the center of commerce, religion, and politics in ancient Rome.
All right, now, the Forum came into being in the sixth century B. C., and with it, a new urban culture was born.
Yeah, Craft?
Is it time for the spaghetti?
It' s 9: 00 in the morning.
So?
You never had leftover spaghetti for breakfast?
I don' t eat carbs.
You never had a spaghetti sandwich, either?
This cultural experience is, like, so wasted on you.
Excuse me, where did you buy that Prada bag?
Craft!
Sanders!
Separate.
We did, Miss Ungermeyer.
And thank God.
Why don' t you people, uh, do something at your, uh, skill level here?
Take a 10- minute shopping break while I choke down an espresso.
This dude definitely spent too much time on his biceps and not enough on his abs.
Totally old school.
Nice spy, bro.
Yeah, watch and learn.
The slow curve.
Works every time.
I' ve got to talk to them.
That' s not how the slow curve works.
They come to us.
Um, eh, ciao.
- Ciao.
- Ciao.
Do you guys speak English?
Yes.
It is your friend we like.
Word.
Word?
Is that his name?
Yeah, sure.
Do you know who that is on the cover?
- Oh, lsabella.
Certo, - Certo,
Do you think you guys could translate it for me?
Um, only if you introduce us to Word.
Can I keep the magazine, then?
Deal!
All right.
Let' s go.
Ciao, Word.
Word?
English?
She' s speaking English.
Our single is in English and lsabella needs to practice.
What have you done?
You look like a schoolgirl.
Maximus, what is wrong?
You love lsabella.
Nice Maximus.
Very odd.
There is something... something very different about you.
Rest.
The rest on the island did lsabella good.
She is transformed.
Yeah.
Well, I cannot put clothes on this.
You - fix the hair.
Fix the eyebrows.
Fix the lips.
- Oh!
- And fix the ears!
Fix the ears?
Jewelry.
That' s a language every girl understands.
You better work
Covergirl
Work it, girl
Give it a twirl
Do your thing
On the runway
Work
You better work it, girl
Wet your lips
And smile to the camera
Work
- Work
- Turn to the right - Oh!
Sashay
Chante
They' re checkin 'out your savoir faire
You had everybody' s eyes on you
Supermodel
Work
Work it, girl
Do your thing
On the runway
Of the world
And smile to the camera
Work
- Work
Work
You better work
Work
Give it up
On the ru- u- u- nway
Work
Okay.
Diva - good.
Tacky - bad.
We' il have to fix that.
Okay, none of these are me.
- Why are you laughing at me?
You' re not supposed to be you.
If I have to go onstage as lsabella, then I- I' m gonna have to be confident, and that' s the thing I' m worst at.
- We are all the same that way.
- Not you.
Yes, me, and lsabella, too.
It' s how she works through her fears that makes her strong.
Isabella doesn' t let Franca di Montecatini tell her what to wear.
Isabella tells Franca.
Okay, so you' re telling me to tell Franca di Monteca- teca - tecatini how I should dress?
Test your strength.
You don' t like my clothes?
No.
No.
I- I love your clothes.
But I don' t want you to dress me.
What?!
See, I' m not your Barbie doll.
I am lsabella Parigi, and I dress myself.
So, choices.
I- I need choices.
I really like these two.
You pick.
Both.
This is the exact color I wore to my spring formal.
- Danny Kessler thought...
Look at all of you.
You' d think that I' m American.
I am, how you say, um... awesome?
The island.
You should go more often.
Goodbye, Lizzie McGuire.
Hello, fabulous.
Come on
You make me feel like a star
Oh, baby
Just the way you are "
Forever in my heart "
That' s why you, yeah, you
You make me feel like a star
- There you go.
- Grazie.
Grazie.
I' m ready for my close- up.
I cannot believe that not one Roman guy has asked me out yet.
Look.
Paolo...
We gotta go!
Where' s the zoom on this thing?
Hello?
Excuse me.
I' m sorry.
I was just...
Head check!
Let' s go!
On the bus, then back to the hotel!
Come on!
Come on!
Go!
Andiamo!
Andiamo!
- Hold on!
Okay!
Hello.
Hotel Cambini.
This is Giorgio.
- Go!
- Huh?
What?
Wait.
Excuse me, can you fix this?
It will not close.
Why is it open when there is no rain?
This umbrella is stubborn.
It' s bad luck to have an open umbrella inside.
- In Hotel Cambini, no bad luck.
- Hey, thanks.
Ah!
One at a time.
No running.
Ha!
Ha ha!
Age before beauty, huh?
You look strangely large and familiar.
Which floor?
Oh.
Thank you.
First.
Okay.
Little hint for you - you want to push the button, elevator moves.
Elevator is not safe.
You an employee here?
- No.
- No.
Who are you to tell me whether the elevator' s safe?
I am Sergei.
Sergei.
You' re gonna have to stand down immediately.
Just because you are one hunk of Slavic muscle does not mean you' re not gonna make it on my list!
Elevator is safe now.
Hey!
Your umbrella!
Feeling any better?
Mom?
Still a little warm.
Miss Sanders, would you be so kind as to look after her for me?
As in do stuff for her?
Why should I be punished?
I' m not the one who' s sick.
Next year, I' m joining the mouth breathers at Water- slide Wonderland.
You are so busted.
You' ve been out of this hotel room.
What?
How do you know?
Please.
Your eyebrows finally match, your hair has highlights, fresh manicure.
I smelled acetone the second I walked in the lobby.
Okay, but you didn' t rat me out to Miss Ungermeyer.
Yet.
Not until I figure out what' s in it for me.
Now spill, Dorkerella.
You' il never make me talk!
I- I know that this sounds insane, but I think Paolo really does like me.
How could this happen?
How did you get my trip?
How is Lizzie McGuire living this fantasy and I can' t even get an ltalian boy to buy me a plate of spaghetti?
Um, Kate, you don' t eat spaghetti.
I' d eat carbs if an ltalian boy bought them for me.
So, I suppose you want me to keep quiet about this?
Yeah.
I' d appreciate that.
Well, I' il keep it quiet if you keep it quiet about me keeping it quiet.
And when we get back home, I' m the cool one again, and you turn back into a pumpkin.
Oh, my God.
It' s her.
What are you doing?
Uh, it' s a long story.
What do you want?
We' re closed.
I- I just wanted to talk to Lizzie.
So talk.
I was kind of thinking maybe, you know, outside in the courtyard.
I know all about it.
She figured it out.
Evil and smart.
Embrace it.
Fear it.
You might want to take a look at this.
I' m on the front cover of a tabloid!
I wish to thank everyone who' s always believed in me for this great honor.
Do you know what that says?
Paolo and lsabella are supposed to be singing at the music awards.
Well, it' s got to be a mistake.
I had some ltalian girls translate it.
Paolo didn' t tell you?
Mmh, no.
Don' t you think it' s weird he tried to hide this?
Can you believe it?
Maybe it' s a last- minute thing.
Aren' t these things planned months in advance?
When did you become an expert on ltalian award- show thingies?
It' s called common sense, which I have a lot of to make up for my lack of the slow curve.
Slow curve?
Forget it.
If you want to believe some ltalian kid you think you know after two days because he' s an international superstar, is really rich and has nice hair, be my guest.
Gordo.
Oh, my God!
He' s early!
Lizzie.
Oh, my God, I gotta get dressed.
I' il cover for you in case Miss Ungermeyer does one of her middle- of- the- night, head- check things.
Thanks.
I owe you.
I think you both should see.
What is it?
I thought I' d do a little E - search on ltaly.
That' s nice, son.
But what I found out, it' s not so E- assuring.
In fact, it may shock you.
What are we looking at?
Maybe nothing, and, uh, maybe something.
You see, when polled, 74% of ltalian teenage boys said they would most like to date American girls.
Where' d you get these numbers?
They' re available for anyone who has a computer.
You don' t have to worry about your sister.
She' s well- chaperoned.
Miss Ungermeyer' s there.
Yeah, what is she, 5' 1 ", 5' 2" max?
Oh, please.
Matt, as interesting as this is, where are you taking it?
All right, you caught me.
I always do.
I don' t know why I even try.
I' il deny I ever said this, but...... I miss my sister.
There.
I said it.
Now you know.
I know I rag on her all the time, but now that she' s gone, I- I -
Oh, honey, we miss her, too.
So, so much.
I feel so alone!
Listen to me.
You don' t have to make fake pie charts.
You just come to us with the truth, okay?
I know that now, Mom.
It' s just so hard.
I miss her so much!
Ietting her go on that trip!
I' il go get the passports.
Oh, honey.
- Paolo.
- Si,
What is this?
Uh, a car.
Look, are we supposed to sing?
Scusa?
Don' t speak to me in ltalian.
It' s too adorable.
Are Paolo and lsabella supposed to sing at the awards?
Si,
Si?!
Well, why didn' t you tell me?
I wanted to, but you told me not to telephone the hotel.
Get in.
I' il explain everything on the way.
I want to show you the Tivoli Gardens before sunset.
Come on.
We have to get you back by 10: 00.
Okay.
So, where is Sergei?
You' re not the only one who sneaks off at night.
I told the producers we refuse to perform.
I said lsabella had throat problems.
So, what happened?
I mean, what changed?
Isabella did.
The real lsabella or me lsabella?
You.
A reporter heard her speaking, and he reported lsabella' s voice was fine.
He said her English was very good.
The record company called, and they' re going to sue if we don' t sing.
What?
So, they' re gonna make you sing?
I- I mean, us sing?
Don' t worry, carina, I' il make this work.
Look.
Look, Paolo, I- I don' t think this is going to work.
I cannot sing in front of an audience.
I won' t even let my mom hear me sing in the shower.
I will teach you all you need to know.
Okay.
So, what is lsabella gonna do when she sees me being her?
She won' t.
She' s off on some island trying to get over this.
Come on.
Here' s my vow to you.
I, Paolo Valisari, will never let you, Lizzie McGuire, be embarrassed.
If I fail, I have to spend seven days with that scary head- check woman.
Her name' s Miss Ungermeyer.
Carina, hasn' t everything I' ve promised you come to be?
Everyone believes you are lsabella.
You' re having the time of your life.
You even told Franca di Montecatini to buzz off!
Don' t you trust that we can do the singing together?
I guess.
Well, you shouldn' t.
You' ve been searching the world to find true love
Looking in all the wrong places
When all of the time, you' ve been blind to love
It' s plain as the nose on your face is
It' s here
It' s now
Open your eyes and see it
Right here
Right now
This is so beautiful.
Yes, you are.
Love has been right by your side
Oh, so close, that you couldn' t see
If love could speak, it would shout to the sky
"I' ve always been here, I always will be"
I' m here
I' m now
Open your eyes and see
Right here
Right now
Open your eyes to love
To love
What do you got there, little man?
- Uh, nothing.
- What' s this?
Uh, that' s not Lizzie!
No!
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn' t.
I know my daughter.
I gave her that necklace.
All right, tell me what you know that I don' t.
It' s only a 14- hour flight, Dad.
Swallow those biscotti.
We got a big day.
The Pantheon, the Colosseum.
Uh, halt!
Got to get these apricots to McGuire.
She looked sick as a dog this morning.
Mr. Gordon, you having a problem?
I' m starting to agree with Ethan.
- We need to eat more spaghetti.
- You da man!
Sorry.
Is there a reason you don' t want me to go upstairs?
No, I- I just really think we should get going.
Uh, so much Roma, so little time- a.
I expect to find Miss McGuire in her bed.
She may be in the bathroom or - or something.
I' m beginning to get the feeling she was never sick to begin with.
No, no, no!
She - She was!
I bet this whole thing was just a clever ruse to sneak out of this hotel, wasn' t it?
Yeah, it - it was.
It was?
Well, Lizzie and I were talking about adventures, and I don' t know.
Ah, spit it out, Gordon.
Lizzie' s upstairs.
It - It' s me.
I' m the one who' s been sneaking out.
- You?
- But - But -
Feels good to get it off my chest.
You realize what this means?
I shouldn' t look to you for a college recommendation?
You should look for your suitcase, Gordon.
You' re goin 'home.
Oh, I pegged you right from the start.
David Gordon.
Sneaky little brownnoser with a hidden agenda.
Well, you' re busted.
Love lifts us up where we belong.
This place is so cool.
Si,
Are you sure it' s okay we' re here?
Si,
And here is where, exactly?
It' s the rehearsal hall.
But the Colosseum will look more like this.
Sergei!
If you want to convince the world you' re lsabella, you must take the stage.
You must dance...
... and sing.
Have you ever seen such a beautiful night?
Just move your mouth with the words.
Oh.
So you want me to lip- synch.
- Si,
Just like lsabella.
You know the song, right?
Uh, well, yeah.
I mean, I have your CD, but...
So try it.
I' m not gonna try it.
- Okay.
Have you ever seen such a beautiful night?
I could almost kiss the stars for shining so bright
Was it awful?
- Uh, yes.
But it helps to sing.
Really - really sing?
It looks more real when you' re lip- synching.
- You weren' t singing.
- But I won' t be lip- synching.
No one' s going to hear you.
The microphone will be off.
You must try.
Please?
Okay.
Have you ever seen such a beautiful night?
I could almost kiss the stars for shining so bright
I go, "Oh, oh, oh"
'Cause in my heart I know what this is
This is what dreams are made of
Dreams are made of
Somewhere I belong
Somebody to love
Are made of
Brava.
And now we dance!
I' m glad you' re up.
I had the most amazing night.
I' m gonna grab Gordo so I can tell you together.
You won' t find him.
What?
Why?
Where' d he go?
Probably getting on a plane right now.
Why?
He totally covered for you and got himself kicked off the trip.
I- I don' t believe it.
W- Why would he do that?
You' re seriously asking that question?
Call the airline and see if Gordo' s plane has left!
- Do you know what flight?
- Si, si,
I will call.
I cannot believe Gordo would do this for me.
Maybe he' s not on the plane yet.
Maybe I could go to the airport and...
And what?
I don' t know.
I am now on hold.
This is the final call for Lufthansa Flight 6240, departing for Los Angeles.
Thank you very nice.
The plane is gone.
Who is this girl?
I have been on the island, trying to forget about this whole situation.
Can somebody tell me what is going on?
I can.
That' s my friend Lizzie McGuire.
Let him go.
Let him go.
I demand you tell me everything you know about Lizzie McGuire.
I demand you tell me everything about Paolo Valisari.
I left him and all thoughts about him on the island.
You may have left him on the island, but Lizzie is out there pretending to be you so you don' t get sued.
We need to talk in private.
Gordo' s life is ruined because of me.
Selfish me!
What are you gonna do now?
It' s over.
I' m going to turn myself in to Miss Ungermeyer.
Lizzie, you' il get sent home, and you won' t be able to help Paolo.
I' m never going to be able to get through this the way I feel now.
Okay.
Fine.
Quit.
But then everything Gordo did will be for nothing.
Now, you know things are bad when Kate starts making sense.
I know one thing' s for sure.
What?
I' m not gonna have to act sick today.
Mr. Craft, you are in the most historic and beautiful city in the world.
Has it had no effect on you?
Well, actually, it has.
The cobblestones are shredding my wheels.
Switched to a pair of birdhouse pterodactyls.
Have you even made a dent in your reading list?
I finished it.
You read 11 books?
I mean I read the list.
McGuire.
Lizzie McGuire.
Si, si, we are in the travel guides.
No.
No.
We' re the parents of Lizzie.
Si!
It' s very far.
Anybody else want to step up to the plate?
Who' s asking for McGuire?
I had left you four messages already, but she' s been under my watchful eye all the while.
Where' d Sanders go?
Lizzie?
Sweetheart?
Honey?
Cool!
Where is Lizzie?
Do you have any embarrassing photos or videos of her while she' s been here?
Tell us where Lizzie is, or this deck' s gonna catch air.
It' s possible she' s at the International Music Video Awards doubling for pop star lsabella, who' s totally her twin.
Why does everyone always look at me like that?
Your dreams will take you very far
In the sky so very dear
No matter who you are
Shining bright to see
What you can truly be
Prince William?
Tell him he' il have to hold.
Shine its watchful light on you
Hey, Paolo!
Words of wisdom, yes, I can
You' re a shining star
No matter who you are
What you can truly be
What?
He said for you to enter from here, stage right, and I must enter from stage left.
What about my dress?
I have to get dressed.
It' s in your dressing room.
Lizzie, you have time.
Calm down.
You can do it.
Of course I can do it.
This is moi we' re talking about.
I don' t think I can do it.
Lizzie, you must.
We' ve rehearsed this.
You know the steps, the words.
You will be great.
I know.
How do you know?
Because.
Because you shine like the light from the sun.
Paolo.
Paolo.
31 minutes till showtime.
Lizzie.
Gordo!
What are you doing here?!
Lizzie, that' s not important right now.
You need to listen to me.
I feel so bad.
I cannot believe you would do that for me.
- Why aren' t you gone?
- Long story.
I want to hear it, but I' ve got to get my dress on.
Listen to me.
Paolo is setting you up.
What are you talking about?
Actually, he is setting me up.
Freaky, huh?
Way freaky.
Way, way freaky.
That whole story about Paolo doing his own music and going solo.
That' s lsabella.
She' s the one that sings live.
Paolo is the one that lip- synchs, not me.
Isabella wants to quit the act.
Paolo is just a liar.
This has all been some scheme to set you up and embarrass you onstage so it looks like lsabella can' t sing.
Si, si, It' s true.
Paolo wants to destroy lsabella' s career.
But Paolo would never do that to me.
I don' t believe you.
Isabella...
Lizzie, who are you going to believe, this boy you are knowing your whole life or this boy you are just meeting who says,
Okay.
Well, then, you' re here now, so go and sing.
But I am not blond.
Paolo will know that it' s me, and he' il make an excuse to leave.
But if we want to get back at him in front of the whole world on live TV, we must make him sing.
And really sing, not lip- synch.
How?
What am I supposed to do?
- I can' t sing live!
Change!
Change your clothes and go up there and do what you rehearsed.
Everything will be fine, I- I promise.
- I have a plan.
- What plan?
28 minutes till showtime.
So, what' s the plan?
I don' t know.
No, see, it doesn' t matter about the tickets, because my daughter is back there impersonating a famous pop star, so I got to get in!
That' s what everyone says.
Enough of this!
Let' s go!
Did Paolo bring the voice track for me?
No.
No, he did not.
There is no track.
Paolo says you' re gonna sing live, like you always do.
Paolo and lsabella!
Sandro, turn down lsabella' s mike.
- What' s that?
- Turn down the mike!
Have you ever seen such a beautiful night?
I could almost kiss the stars for shining so bright
When I see you smiling, I go
"Oh, oh, oh"
I would never want to miss this
I know what this is
This is what dreams are made of
Sing to me, Paolo.
This is what dreams are made of
Okay.
Say buonasera to my new American friend, Lizzie McGuire!
Paolo tried to use her to fool all of you into thinking I could not sing.
Lizzie McGuire is nice girl.
You try to hurt her.
Let me go, Sergei.
You work for me.
Not anymore, Paolo.
I quit.
Paolo!
Paolo cannot sing music.
Now he must face music.
- Was it all a lie?
- No, it' s just...
- Do you want to hear us sing?
Have you ever seen such a beautiful night?
I could almost kiss the stars for shining so bright
When I see you smiling, I go
"Oh, oh, oh"
I would never want to miss this
'Cause in my heart I know what this is
This is what dreams are made of
This is what dreams are made of
I' ve got somewhere I belong
I' ve got somebody to love
Are made of
Wait!
Isabella!
Go!
Si!
Lizzie!
Ru- u- u- u- n!
Have you ever wondered what life is about?
You could search the world and never figure it out
No, no, no
Happiness is no mystery
It' s here and now
It' s you and me, yeah
This is what dreams are made of
This is what dreams are made of
I' ve got somewhere I belong
I' ve got somebody to love
Are made of
This is what dreams are made of
This is what dreams are made of
Open your eyes
This is what dreams are made of
Shout to the skies
This is what dreams are made of
Then I see you smile
And I go, "Oh, oh, oh"
Yesterday my life was duller
Now everything is technicolor
This is what dreams are made of
This is what dreams are made of
I' ve got somewhere I belong
I' ve got somebody to love
This is what dre- e- e- ams
Dre- e- e- ams
Are made of
Lizzie got everything you' re supposed to get when you go to Europe.
Adventure, romance, total confidence.
Yeah?
Well, if all that can happen to Lizzie McGuire, the only thing I know now is I don' t know anything.
That' s hot.
What?
Girls who think they know everything are just a turnoff.
Really?
Oh, totally.
What about you not ratting out Lizzie?
I mean, that was just so... not you.
That' s good.
Si,
Mom, Dad, I' m so glad that you guys made it.
You would have never believed me.
That is for sure.
I thought after you found out all I did, I would be grounded.
You' re grounded for the rest of the summer, sweetheart, but we' re really proud of you.
Lying, even for a good reason, is beneath you, Gordon.
I know.
I know.
I' m a lying, spineless, brownnosing jellyfish with a hidden agenda.
I got it.
That may be true, but I' il tell you something.
Little Miss Diva told me everything.
The way I see it, you' re a pretty loyal friend, Gordon.
And loyalty goes a long way with the Ungermeyer.
- Hmm?
- Thanks.
Hey, just think about it.
We got 4 years of high school to look forward to together.
Sammies.
Sergei is hungry.
So is Miss Ungermeyer.
You are strong woman.
You protect cubs like lioness.
Sergei is impressed.
Hmm.
You' re still on my list.
As long as I am at the top.
Hey, there!
I bet you' re wondering, who is this Lizzie McGuire, where did she come from, and what are her most embarrassing moments?
Well, I can give you total access to all of that for a very competitive price.
Hmm.
When in Rome...
Do as the Romans do, right?
No.
We do not blackmail our sisters.
I am ordering you to leave the country.
No!
Hey.
So, one last sneak- away for old times' sake?
Yeah.
Sounds good.
Okay.
No!
So, are you gonna miss it here?
I don' t know.
Kate says I should stay and have my stuff shipped over, because when I leave, it' il never be the same.
She' s wrong, as usual.
You didn' t have to be in Rome for all this to happen.
You think?
Trust me.
You had it in you the whole time.
Gordo?
What?
Thanks.
You' re welcome.
So, um, want to get back to that party so we don' t get in any more trouble?
I can' t afford any more trouble.
Why not?
Think you' re goin 'nowhere
When you' re walkin 'down the street
Acting like you just don' t care
When life can be so sweet
But why you want to be like that
As if there' s nothing new?
You' re not foolin 'no one
You' re not even foolin 'you
So walk a little slower and open up your eyes
Sometimes it' s so hard to see the good things passin 'by
And there may never be a sign, no flashing neon light
Telling you to make your move when the time is right
Why not
Take a crazy chance?
Why not
Do a crazy dance?
If you lose the moment, you might lose a lot
So why not?
Why not?
Oh, I could be the one for you
Oh, yeah, maybe yes, maybe no
Oh, it could be the thing to do
What I' m sayin 'is you got to let me know, oh, oh
You' il never get to heaven or even to L, A,
If you don' t believe there' s a way
Why not
Take a star from the sky?
Why not
Spread your wings and fly?
It might take a little, and it might take a lot
But why not?
Why not?
Why not
Take a crazy chance?
Why not
Do a crazy dance?
If you lose the moment, you might lose a lot
So why not?
Why not?
You' ve been searching the world
To find true love
Looking in all the wrong places
When all of the time, you' ve been blind to love
It' s plain as the nose on your face is
It' s here, it' s now
Open your eyes and see it
Right here, right now
Open your eyes to love
You' ve been down on yourself, thinking something' s wrong
Wondering why love has never found you
Don' t you know it' s been right here all along
If only you' d look around you?
It' s here
It' s now
Open your eyes and see it
Right here
Right now
Open your eyes to love
Love has been right by your side
Oh, so close that you couldn' t see
If love could speak, it would shout to the sky
"I' ve always been here
I always will be "
I' m here
I' m now
I' m now
Open your eyes and see me
Right here
Right now
Open your eyes to love
Open your mind to love
Open your heart to love
Sometimes, life is so perfect.
Isn' t it?
It has to be.
To make up for all the hard stuff it throws your way.
You have to learn to walk.
You have to learn to talk.
You have to wear that totally ridiculous hat your grandma bought you.
You have no say in the matter.
And when you' re a little older, even though you get to choose your hats, you don' t get to choose what they put in those meatballs at the cafeteria.
Or when to fall in love.
Things happen, and you just have to deal.
And breathe.
Let' s just think of the day my parent' s divorce came through as "Big, Ugly Hat Day."
Refer to diagram B on page 19.
"The Tree of Life."
And breathe.... anybody but his own selfish pleasure.
- Mom, please.
- Focus.
I couldn' t care less about your father' s midlife crisis and complete mockery of his wedding vows.
I just hope he doesn' t expect me to take...
Halley, I' m sorry.
I didn' t see you there.
- Guys...
- Where do you think you' re going?
As long as you' re gonna kill me with flying ice, does it matter?
L...
- Mom?
- Sorry.
I have some really important news to announce here.
Lewis and I... we' re getting married.
He asked me last Saturday night.
I wanted to tell you, but I wasn' t sure when, or how you' d react.
I told him I couldn' t even wear this ring until after I talked to you.
But we wanna have this big Spring wedding.
Mom, I' m so happy.
Nice timing, huh?
Tell your mom you' re getting married on the day she gets divorced.
Why does love make people crazy?
Scarlett, you weren' t picking up your phone.
I' m so sorry.
Halley, that' s Michael.
Michael...
Hi.
Thank you.
Bye!
I love you!
What do you think?
You didn' t tell me you were doing it.
It' s like... it' s like everything you thought... you thought is...
Can you believe it?
No.
I can' t.
Scarlett, come on.
You are sounding dangerously close to a Hallmark greeting card.
You' re gonna let yourself turn into mush over something like sex?
Yeah.
You can' t expect to do anything great in life if you buckle the first time some guy bats his eyes at you.
News flash, Hal.
Even Madonna eventually got married.
My mom thinks that means there' s hope for her, too.
Your mom wants to get married?
Well, she wants to fall in love, Halley.
Everyone does.
Hi.
I' ve been in...
Hi.
I' ve been divorced for a long time, so my baggage is ancient history.
I like to think that I travel light these days.
Except for my daughter, Scarlett, who is just a joy of a carryon.
I think I' m taking the baggage thing too far.
Maybe I should start over.
You know what I think of this whole idea.
I' m only gonna send it to the online guys who pass my rigid five- point checklist.
Here, you try.
- Go away.
- Lydia.
The man of your dreams is sitting out there right now waiting to hear from you.
Speak to him.
I don' t think the perfect man is gonna want to hear what I have to say.
Sure he does, Sweetie.
Speak to him.
Go on.
I' m sorry, Mr. Perfect... but if you' re waiting for me, it' s gonna be a hell of a long wait.
See, I' ve had it with men like you.
I think it' s terrific that you have a great job, and you' re sensitive to the needs of others, and you jog three times a week to keep the belly at bay.
But the second some silicon- breasted, butt- kissing, airhead climber half your age comes along, you can' t keep your pants zipped.
Well, fuck you!
That' s right, Mr. Middle- age, think- you' re- a- big- shot, phony asshole.
You ain' t gettin 'any from me.
Okay.
I think we' il just give this a little time.
So juvenile.
I' m glad you' re back early from camp, even though it was a dishonorable discharge.
What happened?
Where were you trying to get to in that canoe?
No comment.
No comment?
I don' t speak to the press.
I' m the press?
Yeah, and anything I say can and will be used against me, right?
I would never use anything against you.
Dad, give it up!
It' s old, and you need to get your own material.
- Yo.
Len Martin.
It' s you, right?
WDYG' s coolest DJ.
That' s me.
"We dig the dog!"
- Thanks, man.
You are the hippest old guy I know.
Yo, dude!
I' m not that old!
That' s Len Martin.
Hello, gorgeous ones.
And you invited her.
- Hey, Baby.
- Hey.
I thought we' d spend time together, then we could have a chance to bond.
Iook at you, Halley.
That' s hard to do without a mirror, isn' t it?
Honey, you keep getting prettier every day.
I have no idea how you could say that, cause... you definitely don' t see me every day, do you?
And yesterday, oh, my God, I was so ugly, and last Wednesday... that sucked, too.
So it' s kind of a day to day thing.
I love that sense of humor.
Just like her daddy.
- Look at that gorgeous girl.
- Dad, stop it.
She' s got her daddy' s hair.
- Don' t cut it.
- It' s beautiful.
Don' t cut it.
Just let it grow, let it grow.
Don' t cut it.
Cut it.
Okay.
Let me count the ways that this card can be used to induce... nausea, gastric distress, vomiting.
Yeah, go ahead and mock me, but this is serious.
I need to find something funny and something sweet... just the way Scarlett is.
- Okay.
Look, here' s one.
Not helping.
"From small beginnings come great things."
"Congratulations on your new baby."
I thought you were gonna help.
Lighten up, Sherwood.
"The first time we met, you stole my heart."
"Good luck in finding a compatible organ donor." Nice.
I' m kidding, okay?
It' s blank inside.
You know something?
You' re not too funny.
This girl is amazing... unlike you... and she' s sensitive... unlike you.
And she' s sexy.
Unlike you.
- There' s gotta be a card...
- Is that Michael?... for a redhead from...
- I can' t see.... a newly smitten hunka hunka burning love.
Iook.
Summer romance has its own section.
It' s not a summer romance.
I mean...
- Scarlett is...
- Standing right behind you, dude.
Hi.
Sneaking up on me?
- Hi, Halley.
- Hi.
You remember my name?
Sure.
We were in Biology together.
Yeah, I know, but... well, you were never there, really... technically.
I like your hair.
Thank you.
See, my schedule is all wrong, which I think is a sign that nothing' s going according to plan this year.
It' s a complete and total mess.
Looks like a fine schedule to me.
No.
Band?
I would never sign up for band.
- What' s wrong with band?
- I don' t play anything.
Well, maybe you should.
I' m sure you can handle it.
Mrs. Toussaint, this is not my schedule.
Look, I' m signed up for Algebra, and I' ve already taken Calculus.
Maybe a brush- up is a good thing, not to mention a good grade.
Why don' t you just give it a shot before you decide anything?
Okay, I' m signed up for boys' P. E.
- 94 FM - Fill out this form.
- Daddy Dog.
- We' il start again.
Len Martin with a traffic update from that love puppy in the skies, our very own Lorna Queen.
Lorna, you up there?
Hi, Len.
On a clear day, you can see forever, and this is one beautiful morning.
Should we tell everyone our little secret?
Careful.
Baby, you sure this is the time?
I am bursting at the seams to tell everyone we' re eloping.
I just spilled the beans.
That is your father' s show, right?
I just love it.
Hi.
Tell him congratulations.
I' m sure you' re very excited about the upcoming nuptials.
My father and my sister.
My sister and my father?
Your father and your sister are getting married?
Yeah.
No, not to each other.
I...
I have to check something before I fill this out.
Sit down, Forrester.
Let' s see if we can sort out your usual chaos.
Maybe you' il even do us the honor of attending this year.
Okay, later, M. T. I gotta rethink that shop class.
I' m pretty scary with tools.
You didn' t know about your dad getting married?
Yes, I did.
The bastard tells the whole world before he tells you.
He' s not...
Whatever.
At least if they' re eloping, you won' t have to go the wedding.
Weddings are the worst.
I' ve had to go to, like, five between my parents.
Don' t ask.
Listen, M. T. Wasn' t giving you a hard time back there, was she?
"M. T."?
Mrs. Toussaint and I... we' re on close terms.
You get to know your guidance counselor really well when you' re clearly in desperate need of guidance.
See, I' ve got it down to a science.
You try the Jedi mind trick.
- What' s that?
- You never saw Star Wars?
No, I saw it.
I guess I just didn' t memorize it like you did.
Well, that' s your loss, isn' t it?
Because the Jedi mind trick is when you tell someone what to think, and they think it.
For example, M. T. Says,
"Macon, you' re already in trouble, and it' s the first day of school.
Is this any way to start the new year? "
Pretend you' re me.
Now what do you say?
I say...
I wanna be someone else.
You as me say...
Mrs. T, you' re gonna let this one slide because it was an honest mistake, it' s only the first day of school, and the fire was put out as quickly as it was started.
You didn' t really start a fire, did you?
The point is that you put the words into somebody' s mouth and they give them back like they' ve come up with the idea.
Like when I ask you to go out this Friday night, you' re gonna think you' re asking me because you' re gonna say,
"because I know we' il have a great time together.
In fact, I' ve been hoping you' d ask me all week. "
You wanna go out on a date with me?
I told you you' d ask me.
Macon, I think I like you too much already to actually go out with you.
What kind of logic is that?
It' s logical logic.
The quickest way to ruin a relationship with someone is to actually try to have a relationship with them.
Haven' t you noticed when the opposite sex gets together, eventually someone ends up getting hurt?
I am, too... boycotting.
You can' t boycott your father' s wedding.
It' s not even a wedding.
It' s... an elopement.
Yeah, except everyone within his radio frequency is invited.
He is such a hypocrite.
I cannot believe he wouldn' t tell us about it first.
He didn' t give any warning when you went dinner?
- She was at that dinner?
No.
Okay, yeah.
She was there at the end.
Mom, come on.
She wasn' t even supposed to be there.
You know, I don' t think I' m gonna let him walk me down the aisle.
Please stop worrying about me.
I am fine.
In a way, it sets me free.
I feel strangely liberated.
And he is still your father, after all, and if he wants to make a complete and utter fool of himself by trying in some pathetically cliché fashion to recapture his sorry state of manhood, by hooking up with not even a very attractive bimbo... then if that' s what he wants, I' m fine with that.
Someone toss, please.
Now.
This is our reception area.
With out post- ceremony champagne bar... which is conveniently located right next to our very own chapel.
Can' t you picture walking down this aisle?
In a coffin.
Sorry, it' s just... a little depressing.
Actually, nobody' s ever said that before.
Lewis... say something.
What do you think?
Well, I like it.
It' s very clean.
Clean?
Is that what you want our wedding day to be?
It' s not... it' s not pretty, it' s not intimate, it' s not romantic.
I' m just so happy that I get to marry you.
I' m sorry, not to pressure you, but this space does book up quickly for Spring.
We have another couple...
Why don' t we give them a moment to think.
Ashley, Sweetie, they plan the whole thing.
The food, the flowers... even the place cards.
Think about how much less hassle it' il be.
You think planning the most important day of our lives is a hassle?
It hasn' t even been that long.
191/ 2 hours.
Wouldn' t Michael look cool in that?
Hey, I did a good job.
Michael Sherwood would look good in anything.
That' s not the point, though, okay?
Enjoy him, and fool around with him.
Don' t fall in love with him.
It' s not worth it to you to spend on a wedding.
It' s the most important day.
I was trying to kill two birds with one stone.
Cheap is what that is.
You see cheap, I see convenience.
Look at them.
They' re like a walking warning sign against romance.
Lewis is this anal, uptight geek who has my sister under some spell.
Now all this formerly semi- intelligent person thinks about is diamonds and hairdos and bullshit.
It' s like K- Mart.
How am I supposed to know what it looks like?
Maybe go by and look at it?
Or maybe...
See?
They don' t even like each other.
But this stupid spell they' re under makes them disregard all the facts.
They are fighting because they love each other enough to care.
I didn' t know it looked like a K- Mart before I went there.
- Once we got in there, you knew.
- I made a mistake.
Too bad you can' t get a divorce before getting married.
You could save yourself in that stupid extra step.
- I' m sorry.
- See?
- What are you looking for?
- These dishes, they' re perfect.
That' s love, Halley.
Okay, fall once and you may never be able to get back up again.
Geek!
Get out of here.
Isn' t he adorable?
He' s cute.
All right, Michael!
Way to get that goal!
Okay, back up.
Let' s give him some air.
Sherwood?
You hear me?
Guys, back up.
Give him some air, all right?
Call the doctor.
I thought my parents' divorce was the end of the world.
That was before Michael died of a heart defect.
And the world stopped.
Or it should have.
I' m sorry.
What do you think?
I think it' s 100 degrees out.
What am I supposed to do?
The only black clothes I have are winter clothes.
I have nothing nice to wear.
I don' t think it matters, really.
Look, this is... this is dark green and it' s really nice.
It' s ugly, Halley.
I' m just trying to think about something else.
Anything, for one single second.
I wanna look good for him.
Does that sound crazy?
This was a bad idea.
Yeah, but dying is definitely not one of the better concepts.
No, the dress.
Everyone' s looking at me like I' m a freak.
Okay, it' s not for them.
It' s for Michael.
Remember that.
Can you believe what she' s wearing?
That' s, like, so disrespectful.
She always has to have all the attention to herself.
"Although it droop and die that night, it was the plant and flower of light.
In small proportions, we just beauty see.
life may perfect be.
Mr. Macon Forrester will now address us.
I was gonna read from this...
but I' m not very good at reading.
Or writing... or spelling.
Not like Michael.
He was good at so many things without even trying.
He taught me how to be myself.
By myself.
Not to worry about what other people think.
Even if that means being completely uncool.
He taught me about how to trust people.
And how to love.
'Cause he was so good.
He loved his family, he loved his friends.
He loved basketball.
And he loved Scarlett.
And he loved this.
Take this woman, Lorna Queen, to be your lawful wedded wife, your partner, the queen of your heart, forever and ever?
Oh, yeah!
Daddy, rock on with your woman!
And do you, Lorna P. Queen, take this old guy Len to be your lawfully wedded husband for all the rest of your days?
I do.
Wrap it up.
We' re off in 15 seconds.
Our airtime is almost up.
We must now go where Federal regulations will not allow you to follow, if you know what I mean.
Lewis, no barking.
Sorry, but you gotta go.
Poor little thing.
I know just how it feels.
Out with the old, in with the new.
And who do you think you are?
Just because you' ve got great petals.
Oh, my God.
I' m talking to my plants.
Oh, my God.
You' re talking to your plants.
How was it?
It was great... if you happen to be the Devil and enjoy human pain.
Tell me something.
I don' t know!
What do you want me to tell you?
Wait!
No, the bimbo almost died of strangulation.
I cannot believe I forgot to tell you.
Her wedding veil took on a life of its own and rebelled, and she had to claw her way out.
And you know that woman can claw.
It was so sad.
It was like... near death by wedding veil.
Just tragic, isn' t it?
Oh, my God!
And their vows?
Was Dad that much a loser when you guys got married?
I' m sorry.
Your father' s not a loser.
Although he did choose to look like one at our wedding, too.
He insisted on wearing a powder- blue tuxedo.
Then why do people get married, anyways?
We know they' re lying to each other, but are they lying to themselves, too?
How can you promise you' re gonna feel the same way forever?
Things do sometimes change, Halley.
This house is awfully big for just the two of us, don' t you think?
- What?
- You' il be going to college soon.
Mom... a year and 3/ 4 is not really that soon.
I want to start thinking about streamlining.
Maybe we should sell the house.
I grew up in this house.
Yes, and there have been some great memories in this house.
This is my house.
I understand how you must feel, but life changes.
Come on!
And I don' t want to live here alone.
I have to give him a ride.
Bye, Halley.
Stand back!
Leaf man to the rescue.
Where did you get that?
A guy' s gotta pay for gas and bacon burgers somehow, right?
And toys, 'cause I imagine
Star Wars figurines must get pretty expensive.
I do not have any Star Wars figurines.
Not many, and I don' t play with them... much.
This one' s on the house.
Okay.
Here you go.
You' re afraid to go out with me because you might like me?
No, but that' s a good theory, I guess, if you want to protect your fragile male ego.
'Cause you can' t handle rejection.
Rejection?
Whatever!
Of course you think it' s weird that I didn' t just use the phone, but you' re also glad because it' s much better to talk in person.
Especially when I' ve come with such a specific purpose.
Which is why you' re gonna cut me some slack.
You are absolutely crazy.
I' ve been called worse.
You' re gonna kiss me, Halley.
You' re gonna come a little closer...
so I can put my arms around you.
And on the count of three... two... one.
You' re a really good kisser.
You tricked me.
You Jedi mind- tricked me.
Halley, is that you out there?
Close your eyes.
- Give me a break.
- Who are you talking to?
I' m sorry, I...
Sorry.
I needed to talk.
I was just coming over for a little late- night chat.
We' re not gonna stay up very late, okay?
At least do it inside.
"Nausea"?
A little.
"Breast tenderness"?
Yeah.
"Food cravings"?
Grapefruit.
Come on, I could answer "yes" to most of these questions, too.
I used to hate grapefruit.
What' s wrong?
No offense, Halley, but...... your perfume is making me sick.
Come on, I' m not wearing perfume.
"Heightened sense of smell."
Okay, so do you prefer direct pee- on- a- strip or dip- in- a- cup?
Maybe it' s a false reading.
Because I have heard of things such as false readings.
And the strips did not look completely pink, only kind of pinkish, so...
Five kits, Halley.
What am I gonna do?
So you take the car without my permission in the middle of the night on some kind of joy ride.
- It wasn' t a joy ride.
- Maybe I should...
Don' t think you' re off the hook.
You don' t even have your license, and you are a terrible driver.
I was helping Scarlett get some books at school... we left them...
Forget it, Halley!
Mom... taking your car out is gonna seem like the least of it... because whatever you' re thinking right now... it' s worse.
One of you better tell me before I have a nervous breakdown.
I' m pregnant.
Well, thank God you told me in time.
Shouldn' t I be getting paid to wear a dress this ugly?
I' m sorry if you hate my taste and you think it' s so awful you have to be in my wedding, but you are my sister.
- It' s an emotional time.
I was just joking.
Just because you think up something you think is funny, doesn' t mean you say it.
Okay, Ashley, I' m sorry, all right?
It' s just...
I love the dress, really.
You know?
I look awful.
We' il fix it.
It' s not the dress that needs fixing.
It' s me.
Ashley, would you drive Halley home?
I have to get back to work.
Give me my money back, you stupid, lying, feckless, two- timing son of a bitch!
Can I help you, ma' am?
It stole my money, so, just...
Here.
This works a little better sometimes.
- What' s your pleasure?
- Diet Coke sounds good.
The last one.
On me.
I hope I didn' t, you know, kick it too...
I think these machines are built to withstand a good booting every now and then.
- Steve Beckwith.
- Lydia Martin.
Did I say "Martin"?
It' s Lydia Williams now.
- Lydia Williams again.
- Williams, again?
Nice to meet you.
Thank you.
Aren' t you gonna wear lipstick?
You sound like Mom.
Can one of you zip me, please?
You guys know you' re wearing the same dress, right?
Unbelievable.
You' re grandmother' s in there changing.
We practically are.
- I' il change.
- No, I' il change.
- I can change.
- No, I shouldn' t wear black, anyway.
Halley, could you please wear something a little more feminine?
Because the Warshers are really traditional.
Thank you.
Sweetheart, do you need the loo?
I' m gonna use the one downstairs.
Don' t be silly.
Come on in.
- Okay.
- I' m almost through.
It smells like...
Just burning a little incense.
Mother?
Are you smoking the cannabis again?
I had a little headache.
But I' m feeling really much better now.
I knew we' d be late.
We' re fine.
His parents are promptness nuts.
I can' t believe I' m late.
That' s what happens when you make people change ten times.
These leaves would make a wonderful textile.
Halley, look.
I' il bet if we make sheets of this pattern, we' d make a million dollars!
Mother, please, not now.
She' s high.
She' s not high, she' s medicated.
It' s interesting... when you make the "ow 'sound, your mouth does this funny thing in the corner.
You' re not sick anymore.
You were only allowed to use weed when you were sick.
- Could you ring the bell?
- I do get headaches a lot.
Smile.
Does anyone else hear wind chimes or is it just me?
This is a total disaster.
Shit!
Hello.
Now, I know it' s turkey day, but we thought squab would be most special.
They' re absolutely adorable.
- Squab.
- Can I say I' m a vegetarian?
No.
It reminds me of a little yellow parakeet I had when I was a girl.
Such a sweet, smart little bird.
- They look wonderful.
- Thank you.
Marcella' s such a truly magnificent cook.
We are lucky to have found her.
I bet there' s a story in that.
Tell me, how lost were you before you were found?
Because you look like a lady who doesn' t get lost very often.
Grandma.
She came with us 20 years ago, when we moved here from Atlanta.
She really raised our Lewis.
I didn' t realize you were a working mother.
I wasn' t.
She did go through a brokerage training program.
She was good.
Killer instinct.
But she set her sights on me, instead.
I' d say I got the best deal at the firm.
He' s all right.
He' s no Clark Gable... but then very few men are.
What was the name of that character?
Ashley.
No, you' re Ashley.
The wedding plans are coming along beautifully.
Well, you holler if you need any help at all, understand?
I want this to be a memorable affair.
Carol does throw one heck of a luncheon.
That is my one regret about not having more children.
Having girls must be such fun.
But we always felt that having an only child was a much better way to mold and shape character.
Ashley was alone for her first six years.
I like to think she got the best of both worlds.
My best friend is an only child.
She' s having a baby, which at our age is something that obviously wasn' t planned.
And her mom is not really thrilled about the whole situation, but I really think she' s kind of starting to get behind it now, so...
Which way to the bathroom?
Down the hall and to your left.
Isn' t it a surprise... our children choosing to get married so young?
I always thought Lewis would take his time to find the right person.
Well, it must be the example of you and Dad.
I mean... you make marriage seem so fun.
And Ashley' s a lot like you, Mom.
She' s a very determined woman.
Open the door, Halley.
Young lady?
Open the door.
Are you all right?
Lovely evening.
- Thanks for sticking up for me.
- What are you talking about?
Your mom obviously doesn' t want you to get married.
You made it sound like I' m some desperate woman somehow forcing you into the whole thing.
I did not.
"Ashley' s a very determined woman."
I didn' t say that.
I have witnesses!
Mom, you were there.
You did say something along those lines.
Well, that is not how I meant it.
Lewis, you have a lovely family and that is what is important.
They weren' t exactly lovely to you.
"Oh, You actually work for a living, you lower class, pathetic divorcée?"
Ashley, enough.
I' m the one who got humped by a dog in there.
- Where are we?
- You' il see when we get there.
- It' s too dark to see.
- Well, just hold on.
Me and Sherwood found this place a couple years ago.
We used to come here.
You like it?
Yeah.
Let' s dance.
- No.
- Yes.
Come on, Macon.
No.
Please?
Come on, Macon.
- No.
- Please.
You look great, but I just...
Michael' s parents moved to Florida.
You still have to tell them.
I know.
I just can' t figure out what to say that makes any sense.
Which makes sense, given that none of what' s happened makes any sense.
You know, it' s weird.
I would understand you considering having an abortion or putting the baby up for adoption.
You can still put the baby up for adoption.
No.
I know all the arguments.
And I know what I' m giving up.
And I know that nothing is gonna be normal for me anymore.
But what is normal, anyway?
Growing up with my mom sure wasn' t.
Losing Michael wasn' t.
I used to think that my family was the picture- perfect example of normal.
Us.
Maybe being abnormal is what' s normal... right?
Yeah, like you and Macon.
It doesn' t make sense... you falling in love with a guy like him.
I' m not falling in love with him, I like kissing him.
We' re just friends.
With benefits.
Shut up.
- Bye, I' m leaving.
- You' ve got it bad.
I hope this isn' t a bad time.
I can' t stop thinking about you.
You' re out of uniform.
I forgot I was wearing that.
Didn' t I explain?
I' m a Civil War reenactor... a little hobby.
I like thinking about a time when honor and chivalry really meant something.
I know I' ve been slow to take action.
Slows good.
Would dinner tonight be too fast?
Yes.
I mean, no.
I mean, I' d love to.
Cheers.
Friends?
Friends.
Steve, I had a lovely time.
Good night.
- I was just...
- You were just leaving.
Exactly.
This is how you conduct yourself in your own home?
You said it... my own home.
That implies I have a right to choose what I do.
Halley Marie Martin, conduct unbecoming.
No!
You never told me you were serious about this boy.
I' m not serious.
That' s what you do with people you' re not serious about?
You know what?
Maybe if you had a little bit more fun, you wouldn' t be in the position you' re in right now.
Where is all this attitude coming from?
This is not like you.
Like me?
You don' t even know me.
Maybe you' re just not very good at knowing people.
How well do you know that strange boy?
Mom, He' s not strange, okay?
His name is Macon.
And maybe if you paid attention to anyone...
God forbid... besides yourself and Ashley and her stupid wedding, you would know that.
I' m trying.
Halley, you used to talk to me.
Yeah, and you were too busy hating Dad to listen.
I' m sorry you' ve had to go through this.
I hate Dad... so much for doing this to us.
I hate him, I hate him.
And then I don' t hate him, and I feel bad for hating him...
Sweetie, I don' t want you to hate your father.
He' s a decent man.
I don' t want you to hate me either, but I am going to have to start laying down some rules around here.
Here we go.
Halley, you' re grounded until next year.
No.
Mom, please!
No.
No buts, no New Year' s Eve, no Macon.
God!
"Dear Mr. And Mrs. Sherwood...
Guess what?
You' re gonna be grandparents "...
Exclamation point.
Why don' t you try telling Michael' s parents what you really feel?
Macon Land.
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.
Hey, Macon, the man.
Hi.
- The party' s just arrived.
- The party has...
Hold still.
Sorry.
Now, you are pretty.
Come on, you can smile better than that.
What?
She doesn' t know how to smile?
Maybe she doesn' t want to.
Well, excuse me for breathing.
Yeah, you' re breathing too close.
- Sorry about this.
- It' s okay.
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.
Here' s to the new year, right?
Yeah, right.
To the... to the new year.
Okay, knock- knock.
Hey, Macon, my man... what' s up?
What' s up with you?
I lost my damn earring.
Hey, Macon.
Hi, Halley.
Hi.
Thanks.
Nice name.
Who wants to see my ferret?
Dude, I have one.
Come on, dude.
I put a little hat on him and everything.
It' s awesome.
So, when' s Scarlett due, anyway?
You know?
I haven' t told anyone.
Third week of May.
God, that is so freaky.
I didn' t even know they had hooked up.
Really?
They went out all summer.
Did they?
Yeah, and he was completely in love with her.
She' s ruining her life, you know.
I think I' d kill myself before I had a baby.
I know enough to know I wouldn' t be able to handle it.
You' re probably right, because you' re not Scarlett.
Thank God for that.
What' s wrong?
I' m sorry.
Halley, where are you going?
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
I' m sorry.
I really am.
What was that all about?
I thought you wanted us to be together.
I do... but, "together"?
It' s so official and so big for us.
Maybe you should just say what you feel for once.
I could do that.
I can.
I can.
I felt like I had to get out of there because I might... really... care about you, and...
and it scared me so much because that meant that... you could hurt me.
Or maybe I just didn' t feel ready.
To like someone... that much.
And I like you.
Don' t make it so complicated, Halley.
Some people fall in love.
I had to crash into it.
Hey, Baby.
Hi.
I' m sorry.
You gave us quite a scare.
God.
And I ruined your party, too.
I' m not concerned with the party.
Your date with Steve.
I know that was so important to you.
Halley, I know you were with Macon Forrester.
Mom, it was not his fault, though.
We were trying to leave this really bad party.
He was letting me drive... you know I' m like the worst driver, and I could not even see...
Halley, save your strength.
You' re gonna need it to come up with better excuses.
Macon wasn' t there when I woke up.
Macon wasn' t there when I left.
Macon wasn' t there the whole next week at school.
What do you expect when you break your own rules?
Any word from him?
No.
I guess that' s what guys are good at, right?
Disappearing?
Hey.
I' m back.
You really don' t get it, do you?
I' m really not in the mood to wait for you to grow up.
Oh, my... are you okay?
Hi, Halley.
I think I just dropped my keys.
No, they' re in the door.
Stop spinning.
I' m not spinning!
Quiet!
Maybe you should be quiet.
That' s what you should do.
Upstairs.
Oh, Halley, you' re such a good sister.
You think I' m doing those?
I am not doing those.
Be careful.
It' s all right.
This is my bachelorette party.
I am a bachelorette.
Thank you, little sister.
You are the greatest.
Okay, Ashley, please just take this.
What...
You just...
Come on.
Mom is upstairs sleeping.
Mom' s not home.
Really?
And how would you know that?
Friday night she sneaks out to have sex with Steve.
She told you that?
She didn' t want you to know.
God, why do people think that I can' t handle the truth?
Go on, you hatchet- faced scarecrow!
You baboon!
- You bag of bones!
- You old weasel face!
- Sourpuss!
- Sorry old flabby nincompoop!
Top of the morning to you.
How is she?
Sweetie.
A hangover kit.
Not to appear superior, but I did limit myself to one glass of champagne, thank you very much.
If it wasn' t for Halley, I would' ve died, probably.
No, you just would' ve woken up on the porch.
Bet the neighbors would' ve loved that.
Right, especially with the men' s underwear around her neck.
Underwear?
It was nothing.
It was stupid.
Underwear is not nothing.
No, they were pretty much nothing.
We promised each other no strippers.
I know, Lewis, I know, but I was at the mercy of my friends.
Don' t promises we make to each other mean anything?
Of course they mean something, Lewis.
God, don' t be so uptight!
Oh, I' m uptight?
I' m not uptight!
Yes, Lewis, you are.
You are uptight.
You know what else?
Halley was right about you.
You have got a broomstick up your butt.
I never said that!
Okay, well, guess who put it there?
Don' t talk to me that way.
Maybe I' il find somebody fun!
To tell the truth, you' re no fun!
We made a promise to each other, but you don' t keep it because you' re self- absorbed.
Don' t talk to me that way.
Hello.
Good morning, Halley.
- What' s going on?
- I think they' re breaking up.
Relax.
You' re no fun.
Marriage is a promise, and a promise has to be kept.
Not every argument leads to a breakup.
For real!
The wedding is off.
- I' ve been trying to say I' m sorry.
- I' m sorry doesn' t always cut it, Macon!
I couldn' t stay with you at the hospital.
I know I should have, but think how much more freaked out your mom would' ve got if she' d have seen me.
Oh, my God.
Wow, thank you so much.
So, you were ditching me for my own benefit.
No, that' s not it.
I didn' t ditch you.
L...
Okay, I...
I freaked out.
I' m not used to feeling this way about somebody.
And I just...
I couldn' t believe I almost lost you, too.
Here.
Come on, I' il help you eat them.
No.
I don' t want any.
I can' t see you anymore.
Your mom will get over it.
It' s me.
I can get my makeup and hair people to do you on the big day.
If you decide not to get married,
I think you should let them do some work on you anyway, because you are gonna want to look your best when you get back out there.
Darling, there is nothing wrong with canceling a wedding.
No, it' s indefinitely postponed.
That' s what we' re supposed to say officially.
My mom found out.
Actually, I haven' t really made up my mind yet, so if everybody could just...
Oh, Honey.
Give me a hug.
Sweetie, you never know what' s gonna happen.
For a while there, I thought I' d never get married.
Finally, I had to put my foot down or my guy here would never have left...
I' il get that.
Hello?
Honey, it' s their mother calling from Virginia.
It seems your grandmother had a bad fall.
Your mother wants you to meet her there.
Do you think she' s okay in there?
It has been a while.
Grandma, are you all right?
Yes, I' m just smoking a little marijuana.
Look at that pattern.
Is it just me, or is that the spittin 'image of Abraham Lincoln?
Look, Halley, look.
There' s the mole.
Halley, you must see it!
You' re the one who sees things no one else can see.
- I do?
- Yes.
Mother, you' re not supposed to be walking yet.
Next time you fall like that, you' re going to break your hip, then die.
You remember when we went to see our comet together?
Halley was too young to remember that.
No, I do remember.
You can' t possibly.
You remember hearing about it.
No, mom, I do remember.
Why does no one trust me to know what I know anymore?
God.
God!
She doesn' t even think that my own memories belong to me.
Darling, she' s your mother.
Now, tell me about this fella of yours.
Who told you about that?
Grandma, it' s really over.
First loves are never really over.
Nobody' s perfect, Sweetheart.
But that doesn' t mean it wasn' t worth your while.
Do I have the munchies!
- What about him?
- He' s not terrible looking.
Yeah, he' s even cute in that geeky way that you like guys, Ashley.
Halley, it' s...
It' s Lewis.
life of my heart... once again... will you marry me?
Yes.
Yes.
How crazy.
I can' t believe it.
Do it.
I owe you one.
For?
Macon' s a really great guy.
See ya, Halley.
- Hey.
- Hi.
I had no idea that you guys were like... hanging out.
Elizabeth Gunderson and me?
No, we' re just...
- Friends?
- Yeah.
Right.
No, it' s fine because we had our thing, and it was fun... until it wasn' t anymore, right?
No, that' s not it.
When the going gets tough, it' s best to just keep going, don' t you think?
Would you listen to me for a sec?
And to my bride.
Thank you for showing me that socks don' t need to be ironed... that one needn' t employ the Dewey decimal system for their CD collection... and that, in the end, it doesn' t make a whole lot of difference whether you start the toilet paper facing up or down.
Despite what my parents taught me.
Because, Ashley, you have shown me that life is worth embracing.
Even if it means making a giant fool of yourself.
And lucky for me, you' re willing to marry the guy who' s been the biggest fool of all.
So here' s to a lifetime of big, messy, wonderfully out- of- order moments with the most beautiful woman in the world... my bride.
Your big sister is getting married in 31/ 2 hours.
You know if you get nervous, you can always...
You remember the sign.
Of course.
You taught it to me, remember?
So, you know.
Just...
Like that.
I' il do something.
I' il yell, "fire," okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
And we' re back with the big dog of soft rock,
WDYG, 94 FM.
"We dig the dog."
'cause one of my very own puppies... the eldest...
Ashley, is getting married.
Lorna, Honey, any words of wisdom coming from you, my very own newlywed?
Waterproof mascara.
I' m gonna borrow yours, 'cause Daddy' s gonna be weeping like a baby.
All right, let' s kick off this Power Hour Of Love.
- Are you there?
- Security?
Hey, give me... come on.
This is my job!
My Halley?
I don' t know how to get you to listen, but maybe...
- Let him talk.
- Just hear me out.
I suck with words.
But sometimes, words aren' t the thing.
Love isn' t about words, it' s about what you do.
And what I did... running away, it was stupid.
We both know love' s a big, scary, evil concept.
But if you feel it, it' s gonna follow you around like a hungry dog no matter how far you run.
Wait.
I didn' t mean to say love' s a dog.
I just mean, I' m not going anywhere.
I love you, Halley.
If love beats us up, let' s beat it up right back.
We could do this.
If you' re ready to make the jump, I' il be right here to catch you.
And what a powerful Power Hour Of Love it has been.
This is Len Martin for WDYG, the Big Dog of soft rock.
That' s right.
Romance is in the air.
It' s everywhere here today, folks.
'cause Daddy loves you.
You look beautiful.
You look beautiful, Mom.
I' m not too old to wear pink?
No.
I look like a giant helium balloon.
Come on.
We have to go.
I' m gonna walk over.
I' il meet you there.
Let' s get Halley!
Back seat.
I need to lie down.
Please be seated.
We have come together today to join in Holy Matrimony
Ashley Renee Martin and Lewis Gibson Warsher Il.
If any among you know any reason why this couple may not lawfully be married, declare it now or forever hold your peace.
Do you, Lewis, promise to love, honor, and cherish Ashley from this day forward, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, forsaking all others as long as you both shall live?
I do.
And do you, Ashley, promise to love, honor, and cherish Lewis for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, forsaking all others as long as you both shall live?
I do.
The rings?
Dear friends, let us ask God to bless these rings as a symbol of their love everlasting.
No.
No, the other finger.
That' s right.
- Ashley, Lewis...
- She' s having the baby.
- It is now my delight...
- Please be quiet.... and honor to declare you husband and wife.
You may now kiss the bride.
She' s having the baby.
Now.
Right now?
Scarlett' s having the baby.
I have to go.
I' m sorry.
Scarlett' s having the baby.
Breathe.
Wait, wait, wait!
No.
Shit!
Oh, for heaven' s sake.
It' s okay.
You' re gonna have the baby!
Thank you so much.
Thanks.
You have got to do something.
That was just a dreadful scene.
Now the seating arrangement' s gonna be a disaster.
One empty seat throws everything off.
Mother, stop it.
Okay?
It doesn' t get any better than this.
Squeeze my hand.
It' s okay.
We' re gonna get there.
I assume Daddy would like to be in the delivery room?
Me?
No, no.
L...
- Baby!
- Mommy!
- Hi, Sweetie.
- I need you.
I' m her mother.
- Miss Smith?
- It' s okay.
Thank you.
Don' t leave me.
So, do you hate me?
Not you, per se.
I hate the way your hair falls in your face.
And I hate the way your voice gets really low when you' re serious.
And I hate the way you bite your bottom lip when you' re nervous.
And the way your eyebrow goes... like that.
I hate that.
So, that' s it?
You just hate the way I walk and talk and look?
No.
That Jedi mind trick thing?
I hate that.
Don' t give up on me.
I' m not.
But you are gonna regret ever having messed up.
'Cause I' m gonna make you pay for a long time.
But first...
You' re going to take three steps towards me.
And you' re going to wrap your arms around my waist.
And on the count of three... two...
We' re gonna dance.
Never thought that I' d be fighting you
But you stole my heart you cheated and lied you Weren' t in my corner you Weren' t on my side
The gloves are off you hit below the belt
Now it' s time- out, baby And they' ve rung the bell
I' m not a fighter I' m a lover
But if you run Then run for cover
Fight for your love yeah
- When it' s round two, girl - Turn this up!
Now!
- Good.
- I get a knockout punch
With this heartfelt song
I' il find you ln my loving arms again
The gloves are off you hit below the belt
Now it' s time- out, baby And they' ve rung the bell
I' m not a fighter I' m a lover
But if you run Then run for cover
Fight for your love yeah
I' m not a fighter I' m a lover
But if you run Then run for cover
Fight for your love yeah
Whoa, nobody caught me.
That was lame.
I don' t think he' s moving.
He is a lazy freeloader, and it' s time for all this dysfunction to stop.
Can' t We just do this later?
I mean, you know how he gets in the morning.
Ned, aren' t you tired of letting people push you around?
Yes.
Then get in there and do it.
What?
What is it?
Dewey, hey, it' s the first of the month, and...... l' d like your share of the rent now.
Man, you know I don' t have it.
You wake me up for that?
Come on, man!
Sorry.
Dewey, I mean, you owe me a lot of money as it is.
Yeah, try $2, 200.
Ok, you guys, the band is about to hit it bigtime.
We' il win Battle of the Bands.
I Will throw you and your dog a bone.
Good night.
- Your band has never made 2 cents.
- Patty, come on, I' m on this.
Oh, you' re on this?
You' re on this?
He' s Walking all over you.
Mommy, could we please talk about this later?
No, We can' t talk about it later, because we have to go to work.
We have jobs.
We contribute to society.
All right?
I am an assistant to the mayor of the city, "hello"!
What?
Can you get her out of here, please?
Why?
Why her?
And Ned has the most important job there is.
Temping?
Dewey, a substitute teacher is not a temp.
- He' s a babysitter.
- Think it' s so easy?
I' d like to see you try.
You Wouldn' t last a day.
Dude, I service society by rocking.
I' m out there liberating people With my music.
Rocking ain' t no Walk in the park, lady.
All right, this is useless, all right?
Tell him if he doesn' t come up With the rent by the end of the Week, he' s out of here.
Dewey, I' m not paying your share of the rent, so...... maybe you should sell one of your guitars or something.
What?
Would you tell Picasso to sell his guitars?
Oh, my God.
He' s an idiot.
Dude, I' ve been mooching off you for years, and it was never a problem until she showed up.
Dump her.
lf you don' t come up with some money, she' il dump me.
Really?
That would be good.
She' s a nightmare.
Come on.
I may never have another girlfriend.
I mean, just come on.
Come up with some money, please.
Please.
Ok.
For you.
Not for her, man.
For you.
Thank you.
Heal me
I' m heartsick D minor.
I' m hungry And A minor, G, on you
- Heal my heart - Hey!
What' s up?
ls that a new song?
Who' s this guy?
We' re taking the Battle of the Bands seriously this year.
Good, because I need the money.
Now, listen.
lf We' re gonna win this thing, We gotta actually start playing some music.
I agree.
You' re fired.
Your lyrics, now don' t take this the wrong way, Theo, are lame.
But I' ve been sitting on some awesome material, so...
Did you hear What I said?
We voted.
You' re out.
This is Spider.
He' s replacing you.
What' s up, dog?
I was gonna tell you last night, but you passed out, man.
You' re gonna kick me out of the band?
You' re gonna fire me?
- It' s my band.
I brought us together.
- Theo wanted you out.
- There' s nothing I could do.
- Shut up, man.
You voted him out too.
Dewey, listen to me.
You' re a good guitar player, but it' s the 20- minute solos.
It' s the stage dives.
We' re trying to land a record deal here, man, and you' re an embarrassment.
Read between the lines, Theo.
Read between the lines!
Dewey, man, I hope this doesn' t come between us.
Like, I care about you, man.
You guys, you know what?
You' re nuts.
You' re all nuts.
You' ve been focused so hard on making it, you forgot about one thing.
It' s called the music.
And I don' t even care.
So what.
I don' t wanna hang out with wannabe corporate sellouts.
I' m gonna form my own band.
We' re gonna start a revolution.
And you' re gonna be a funny little footnote on my epic ass.
I feel sorry for you guys.
Yes.
Yeah, it' s a 1968 Gibson SG, mint condish.
No.
That' s all?
Well, that' s a mistake.
No, Hendrix played this guitar.
Hello?
- Yeah?
- ls this Mr. Schneebly?
No, he' s not here.
- Could you take a message for me?
- Yeah.
Hi.
My name' s Rosalie Mullins.
I' m the principal at Horace Green Prep.
We' re having a little emergency.
One of our teachers broke her leg this morning, and all of our subs are already working.
Pat Wickam at Milton Prep recommended I call Mr. Schneebly.
Do you know if he' s available?
- How long is the gig?
- Excuse me?
How long is the job?
As much as a few weeks, but we need somebody to start immediately.
So how much are we talking here?
We pay our substitutes 650 a Week.
Now, do you know when Mr. Schneebly will be back?
Oh, you know what?
I think he' s just coming in right...
Ned, phone!
Hello, this is Ned Schneebly.
Pat faxed me your rèsumè.
It' s very impressive.
We' ve never been in a bind like this before, so thank you so much.
So how' s this gonna work?
Are you gonna pay me upfront?
I don' t understand.
It' d be really great if I could get paid in cash.
Oh, Well, We don' t do that.
When you cut my check, make it payable to Dewey Finn, for tax reasons.
You can discuss all of that with Candace at the end of the day.
When' s the end of the day?
We commence at 8: 15, school lets out at 3.
You know what?
Do you think I could cut out a little early today?
I got some stuff I gotta do.
I can stay.
Mr. Schneebly...... this is considered the best elementary school in the state, and We maintain that by adhering to a strict code of conduct, faculty included.
Don' t worry about me.
I' m a hard- ass.
lf a kid gets out of line, I got no problem smacking him.
No, no.
We don' t use corporal punishment here.
Ok, so just verbal abuse?
lf you have any problems with any students, send them to me.
- I will do the disciplining.
- Check.
Children.
Please take your seats.
I' d like to introduce Miss Dunham' s substitute.
This is Mr. Schneebly.
Why don' t you write your name on the board.
Yes, I will.
You know what?
Why don' t you all just call me "Mr. S".
Mr. S has never taught here at Horace Green, so I Want you all to be on your best behavior.
So the curriculum is on the desk.
- And do you have any questions?
- Yeah, When' s lunch?
The children just had their lunch.
ls there anything else you need?
I' m a teacher.
All I need are minds for molding.
All right, then.
Well, thanks again.
You saved the day.
Ok, Who' s got food in here?
You' re not gonna get in trouble.
I' m hungry.
You.
What do you got?
That' s What I' m talking about.
Ok.
Teach.
Teach.
Teach.
I' ve got a hangover.
Who knoWs What that means?
- Doesn' t that mean you' re drunk?
- No.
It means I Was drunk yesterday.
- It means you' re an alcoholic.
- Wrong.
You Wouldn' t come to Work hung- over unless you Were.
Dude, you got a disease.
- What' s your name?
- Freddy Jones.
Freddy Jones, shut up.
Shut up.
The point is, you all can just chill today.
We' il start on this crapola tomorroW.
- Yes, Tinkerbell?
- Summer.
As class factotum, first I' d like to just say, Welcome to Horace Green.
- Thank you.
- Any questions about our schedule?
Because usually noW Miss Dunham teaches vocabulary, then gives us a pop quiz, then splits us up into reading groups.
- Track B is...
- Ok, hey, hey, hey.
Miss "Dumbum" ain' t your teacher today, I am.
And I got a headache and the runs.
So I say, time for recess.
But Mr. S, that poster charts everyone' s performance.
We get stars When We master the material covered.
HoW do We get gold stars if We just have recess?
- What are these black dots here?
- Demerits.
What kind of a sick school is this?
As long as I' m here, there Will be no grades or gold stars or demerits.
We' re gonna have recess all the time.
But Miss Dunham only gives us recess for 1 5 minutes...
You' re not hearing me, girl.
I' m in charge noW, Ok?
And I say recess.
Go.
Play and have fun, noW.
Nice.
NoW, you don' t Want me to have to call your parents, do you?
It' s all right, Emily, don' t cry.
Just try to be a bit more conscientious.
Would you like a hug?
I' il be good, I sWear!
All right, Well, that' s fine, Emily.
You' re excused.
We did it, come on.
Give me some.
Give me some.
I Will see you cats on the flip- flop.
Later!
I heard she slipped in the bathroom.
Who comes very highly recommended.
- Mr. Schneebly?
- Yeah!
Hold on, buddy!
Oh, my God.
You' ve gotta be kidding me.
Oh, man, this guy sucks, man.
- Here, call him.
- Call him?
Yeah, right.
Yes, you can be in my band.
But, Ned, no poWer plays, man.
I' ve got vision up the butt, so just go With it.
No, thanks.
You' re not a teacher, Ned.
You' re the cross- dressing, blood- sucking incubus from Maggot Death.
That' s the real you.
DeWey, I' m not a satanic sex god anymore.
I' m a Working stiff.
And that' s cool.
- She' s got you brainWashed.
- I' m Working.
That' s terrific.
But Who are you, babe?
This is my apartment, babe.
Not if you don' t pay your rent, it' s not.
Get a job.
I got a job.
I' il have rent by the end of the Week.
Go tell the mayor.
- You got a job.
Doing What?
- I do What Ned does, temping.
I' m a sub.
And soon I' il be a certified teacher.
Come on, man!
We split it 60/ 40.
Grab your bass and come back to the garage.
I mean, don' t you miss rocking out?
lf you think anyone is gonna be in a band With you, you' re more delusional than I thought.
DeWey, you knoW, maybe it' s time to give up those dreams.
I did, and things are going really great for me.
Are you gonna teach us anything or are We just gonna sit here?
Just do Whatever you Want.
- I Want to learn from my teacher.
- Besides that.
Freddy, What do you like to do?
I don' t knoW, burn stuff?
Just go out and have recess.
My parents don' t spend $1 5, 000 a year for recess.
- You Want to learn something?
- Yes, I do.
You Want me to teach you something?
All right, here' s a useful lesson for you.
Give up.
Just quit.
Because in this life, you can' t Win.
Yeah, you can try, but in the end, you' re just gonna lose, bigtime, because the World is run by The Man.
- Who?
- The Man.
Oh, you don' t knoW The Man?
Well, he' s everywhere.
ln the White House, doWn the hall.
Miss Mullins, she' s The Man.
And The Man ruined the ozone, and he' s burning doWn the Amazon, and he kidnapped Shamu and put her in a chlorine tank.
There used to be a Way to stick it to The Man.
It Was called rock 'n' roll.
But guess What.
Oh, no.
The Man ruined that too With a little thing called MTV!
So don' t Waste your time trying to make anything cool or pure or aWesome.
The Man' s just gonna call you a fat, Washed- up loser and crush your soul.
So do yourselves a favor and just give up!
Mr. Schneebly, it' s after 1 0.
Right.
Ok.
Good Work, people.
We Will continue With our lecture on The Man When We return.
Have a good music class.

It' s called... "Rock Band".

It may sound easy, but nothing could be harder.
It Will test your head and your mind and your brain too.
Will other schools be competing?
You could say that.
Will be competing for the top prize.
What' s the prize?
A Win Will go on your permanent record.
Hello, Harvard, yo.
We' re not supposed to get started until next quarter, but I think We should get a leg up on the competition, don' t you?
I do.

But if anyone finds out, We' il be disqualified.
So let' s just keep it on the doWn- loW, shall We?
- Can We tell our parents?
- No!
Trust me.
They don' t Want to knoW. keep it zipped.
All right, you guys, let' s kick it into overdrive.
What are the rest of us supposed to do?
You just sit back and enjoy the magic of rock.
You mean We' re not in the band?
NoW, hold up noW.
Just because you' re not in the band doesn' t mean you' re not in the band.
We need backup singers.
Who can sing?
You, sing.

Dude, you are cool.
The Way you play.
Why do you say you' re not cool?
Nobody ever talks to me.
Well, those days are over, buddy.
You could be the ugliest sad sack on the planet, but if you' re in a rocking band, you' re the cat' s pajamas.

I Was not planning on unveiling it, but I Will sing it.
Tip of the tongue, teeth and the lips.
Ok.
It starts off...... a dark stage, and then a beam of light, and you can see me and my guitar.
ln the end of time
There Was a man Who kneW the road
And the Writing Was Written on the stone
And then a thin layer of fog comes in around my ankles.
Roadies, that means dry ice.
We' re gonna talk about this later.
ln the ancient time
An artist led the Way
But no one Seemed to understand
Chimes, Freddy.
ln his heart he kneW
The artist must be true
But the legend of the rent Was Way past due
And then, katie, you come in With the bass.
Well, you think you' il be just fine Without me, but you' re mine y ou think you can Kick me out of the band
And then, Zack, you come in With a face- melter.
Ok?

HoW can you kick me out Of What is mine?
And then...
HaWaii Five- O.
You ever see that shoW?
Ok, Well, there' s a drum solo in it that goes: y ou' re not hardcore
Unless you live hardcore
And I Want the backup singers to be like:

But I figure I' m gonna be here for a While.
Well, that remains to be seen.
- Have you met our other teachers?
- No.
But the kids could learn by getting out of the classroom.
It' s more complicated than that.
There' s safety issues.
Parents need to be notified.
It' s against school policy.
Mr. S, I have a lot of ideas.
HoW about everyone in magenta With beads and sequins?

Which test do you find most effective, the TASS or the Wilson- Binet?
I say no testing, and I Will tell you Why, Joe.
- Gabe.
- Gabe.
I believe...... that the children are the future.
NoW, you can teach them Well, but you have gotta let them lead the Way.
Let the children' s laughter...... just remind us hoW We used to be.
That' s What I decided long ago.

Guess Who did.
Yo- Yo Ma' s cousin, little "nepotis".
Anyway, I just decided to give up and become a teacher, because those that can' t do, teach.
And those that can' t teach, teach gym.
Am I right?

That Was a really cool lesson today.

Right?
The best defense is a good offense.
And, Roberta, noW that I see you...
Hey, is she alWays like that?
Oh, yeah.
Except for the time she got drunk at the alumni dinner.
You should have seen that.
She got up on the table and did a Stevie Nicks impersonation.

Why?
What are you afraid of?

He Was gonna call the fuzz.
Would you just listen to me?
I have an idea.
Hi.

I just Wanted to say, I' m really sorry.
I shouldn' t have barged in here.
It Wasn' t fair to you or the kids, especially after What they' ve been through.
God, I feel like a jerk.

I Wanted to give them something to look forward to, to keep their spirits up.
Look at them.
They' re terminal.
Every last one of them.

You knoW What?
Well...
Well, What' s that?
Oh, that.
Yeah.
We Were singing.
We Were singing and learning.
We Were learning in sing- song.
- One of your methods?
- Yeah.
I find it' s helpful When you' re teaching the subjects that are the boring subjects.
Well, you don' t mind if I just sit in on your class this afternoon, do you?
No.
No.
Come on back this afternoon.
It is the afternoon.
I meant noW.
So please just continue With your method.
Ok.
Math is a Wonderful thing
Math is a really cool thing
So get off your "ath" Let' s do some math
Math, math, math, math, math
- Three minus four is...
- Negative one.
That' s right.
And six times a billion is...
- Six billion?
- Nailed it.
And 54 is 45 more than...
What is the ansWer, Marta?
- Nine.
- No, it' s eight
No, it' s nine y es, I Was testing you It' s nine
And that' s a magic number
I' m very happy that you' re able to extend your stay, but I must say, I find your methods of teaching very unusual.
Well, I did study With Dr. Errol Von Straussenburgerbecken.
- Who?
- Oh, you don' t knoW him?
Oh, he' s, like, one of the leading leaders in... unusual methods.
Actually, he' s hoW I Was appointed to the Presidential Council for Experimental Educationers.
That sounds very impressive, but We' re not interested in experimental education here.
So if from noW on you could just stick to the curriculum, that Would be great.
- Yes.
Right.
- Thank you.
Ros?
- Yes?
I Would really love to talk some more about your philosophy on teaching.
Do you think maybe We could grab some coffee?
You Want to go get some coffee With me?
I really Would.
- You' re sure you don' t have coffee?
- I' m quite sure.
Well, I' ve never been here before.
I' ve never been to this side of toWn before, in fact.
So I have been...
Well, I' ve been...
I' ve been dying to ask you something, Mr. Schneebly.
- Please, call me "DeWey".
- DeWey?
Ned.
Call me "Ned".
I Was thinking of my other name.
My middle name.
- Yeah.
- Well, Ned...
... in your experience, hoW does Horace Green compare to the other schools that you' ve taught at?
Oh, your school is the best.
- You' re just saying that.
- I' m not.
You knoW that kids at other schools just have fun all the time?
They run around.
There' s no discipline.
They' re happy.
It' s anarchy.
This is the best school I have ever teached at.
I sWear.
I' il drink to that.
Stay there.
I' m gonna put on some music.
- I love this song.
- Really?
- Yes.
Stevie Nicks.

I Wasn' t alWays like this.
I Wasn' t alWays Wound this tight.
There Was a time When I Was fun.
I Was funny.
But you can' t be funny and be the principal of a prep school.
No, you cannot, because When it comes to their kids, these parents, they have no sense of humor.
lf anything goes Wrong, it' s my head.
It' s my head in the smasher.
These parents Will come doWn on me like a nuclear bomb.
I can' t make a mistake.
I gotta be perfect.
And that pressure has turned me into one thing that I never Wanted to be.
A bitch.
You' re not.
- Yes, I am.
I am a big one.
Well, I don' t think so.

You' re gonna talk to me about style?
You can' t dress yourself.
Look at that boW tie.
Don' t talk about my boW tie.

Can We try that?
Also, We need some "ooh la- la' s", so like:

And if you Wanna be The teacher' s pet

Rock got no reason Rock got no rhyme y ou' d better get me to school on time And if you Wanna be the teacher' s pet
Baby, you just better forget it
Rock got no reason Rock got no rhyme y ou better get me to school on time

TomorroW is the big day, so get your rest.
No late parties, drinking tequila and trying to get lucky.
Chances like this do not come around every day.
You' ve played hard in here, and I am proud of every last stinking one of you.
Let' s just give this everything We got.
We may fall on our faces, but if We do, We Will fall With dignity!
With a guitar in our hands and rock in our hearts!
And in the Words of AC/ DC:
"We roll tonight to the guitar bite,
"and for those about to rock...
"... l salute you."
Ros, excuse me, Wanted to remind you about our field trip tomorroW.
- What field trip?
- The educational concert.
Oh, I forgot about that.
I don' t knoW, school policy is very difficult to get around.
But you said We could make an exception, and the kids are excited about hearing some Mozart.
I knoW, but the preparations, there' s not enough time.
I don' t knoW anything about it.
Where is it?
I' ve got it all covered.
What' s going on, are you mad at me?
No, no, Ned.
I' m sorry, I' m just a little stressed out because it' s Parents' Night tonight.
Hey, it' s all gonna be fine.
Ned, Would you mind coming With me tonight to Parents' Night?
It Wouldn' t be a date or anything.
I get nervous around the parents, and there' s something about you that makes me feel more relaxed.
You knoW What, that sounds so great, Ros, but...
- But What?
- I Wasn' t planning on going tonight.
You have to.
You' re their teacher.
You have to give the presentation.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
No, I got you.
I' m ready for that.
So We' il go together?
Ok.
Why don' t you pick me up at, say, 6: 40.
- Done.
All right.
- Ok.
- What are you all dressed up for?
- I got a hot date.
That' s Weird.
I got a check from Horace Green Prep for $1, 200.
I' ve never Worked there.
- What are you doing?
- Calling the school.
Hi, this is Ned Schneebly...
DeWey?
What' s going on?
I told them 1 5 times, make it out to cash!
DeWey?
I did something bad, Ned.
- No.
- Yeah.
They called for a sub.
I said I Was you, to make some money.
But then I got there, and the kids, they rock, man.
There' s this kid Larry Who' s like, "I' m not cool," but noW he' s like:
There' s this other girl Who can sing like:
She thought she Was too fat, so they Were dying, and the principal got drunk.
NoW We' re playing Battle of the Bands.
It' s the coolest thing!
One day.
Then I Will come clean.
I' il tell everyone it Was my fault.
You' il be fine.
One day!
- Ned, home.
- Don' t say anything to her.
She' il bloW everything.
Please?
Hey.
What' s going on?
Nothing.
I got a hot date, that' s What' s going on.
See you later.
What' s going on, Ned?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
Well...
Ok, I don' t think I can go in there.
- What' s Wrong?
- Ros...... l' m not a teacher.
Oh, Ned.
A substitute is a teacher.
No, no.
I' m not a teacher.
I' m a fraud.
No.
You' re not.
You' re a dedicated, talented teacher, and those parents are gonna love you.
Just get in there and tell those parents What you' ve been teaching their kids.
Yeah, you knoW, math, English...
What...?
Science...
What else?
Geography, history,
Latin, Spanish, French,
Math.
Did I say that already?
Anyway, all the stuff you Want your kids to knoW, it' s been covered, Ok?
So...... it Was great to meet you all, and drive safe.
Excuse me.
Since you started, all my son talks about is music.
He says he Wants to be a musician.
ls this your influence?
Why has my daughter become obsessed With David Geffen?
And hoW is this homeWork?
Ok, see, I Would like to tell you about What We' ve been doing in here, but there' s such a thing as teacher- student confidentiality, and I don' t Want to be in breach of educational laW because I could be dismembered by the teacher' s union.
So...
You expect us to believe this garbage?
Mr. S, don' t you think you should tell them about the project?
- What project?
- Our class project.
Every school in the state is competing.
- Competing?
- It' s not till next quarter, but Mr. S Wanted us to get a head start.
- Well, What' s the project, Summer?
- It' s prestigious.
A Win Will go on our permanent record.
You might as Well tell them, Mr. Schneebly.
Ok, look.
I' ve gotten to knoW your kids the past feW Weeks.
They' re aWesome.
Zack is an insane guitarist.
He' s the next Hendrix, and he' s 1 0.
And Gordon here, he' s a genius!
He did a Whole professional light shoW on his computer in three days.
And Marta here, she' s...
She can hit an A above high C.
Did you knoW that?
Because that' s tough.
Not many singers can do that.
And...
Summer is gonna be the first Woman president of the United States.
She could run this year.
I Would vote for her.
Look, they' re just really cool kids.
lf they Were mine, I Would be so proud.
And I am proud, just to even knoW them.
And...
Sir, can I see you in the hall for a moment?
Let me just say a couple more things.
- What' s going on?
- What' s happening?
Apparently, that man is not Ned Schneebly.
- What?
- What?
- This man is Ned Schneebly.
- He' s not even a teacher.
- You called the cops?
- She did.
She got it out of me.
Sorry.
- You' re apologizing to him?
- Sorry.
Ned.
Ned, is this true?
Who are you?
My name is DeWey Finn.
And, no, I' m not a licensed teacher, but I have been touched by your kids.
And I' m pretty sure I' ve touched them.
- What?
- Oh, my God.
- I have nothing to say to you.
- Me either.
Ok.
I' m going to bed.
It' s one thing to throW your life aWay, but to put Ned in jeopardy is selfish.
You told me to be like Ned and get a job.
I told you to be like Ned, I didn' t tell you to be Ned.
- You' re not gonna apologize?
- You apologize for calling the cops.
I didn' t murder anybody.
I Wanted to play a great shoW.
- I Was this close.
- Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Would you both just cut it out for one second?
Look, I' m sorry, dude.
I Was desperate.
It Was easy for you to give up music.
- It ain' t easy for me.
- It Wasn' t easy for me.
I miss it.
Well, then Why' d you give it up?
Because I couldn' t keep kidding myself anymore.
You can blame it all on bad luck, but in the end, maybe We just Weren' t that good.
Sometimes you gotta knoW When to quit.
- Right, maybe I suck.
- That' s not What I said.
Well, music is my life, man.
What do you Want me to do?
I don' t knoW, but...... l think it' s time you moved out.
Sorry.
- So his name Wasn' t Mr. Schneebly?
- No, it Was, like, DeWey something.
What about the project?
Wake up, Marco, there Was no project.
He Wanted us to play a shoW so We could make money.
I can' t believe We Weren' t graded.
Why are you bummed?
We had a three- Week vacation.
It Was a Waste of time, but it Was better than school.
- It Was not a Waste of time.
- Yeah, that' s What it Was.
- You' re an idiot.
- Shut up.
- No, you shut up.
- You Want to go?
Touch him, I' il shove those sticks doWn your throat.
Mr. S Was cool.
We Worked too long and too hard not to play the shoW.
Ok, so What are We supposed to do?
We get out of here and play the damn shoW.
HoW could you let our kids be exposed to this impostor?
- Do you just let anyone teach here?
- I pay $1 5, 000...
Let me assure you that nothing is more important to us than for you to feel your children are in a safe and secure environment.
- Ok, We' re all here.
- Where' s Mr. Schneebly?
He didn' t tell you?
He' s at home.
We need to pick him up.
Let' s go, hurry.
Excuse me.
Just one second, please.
- Excuse me.
- Wait a minute.
Where are you going?
- We Want some ansWers, noW!
- Just one second!
Where did they go?
Help!
Children?
Wake up.
- HoW' d you guys get in here?
- Front door Was open.
Why aren' t you in school?
We did What you said.
We stuck it to The Man.
Forget about What I told you.
Look, I' m a loser, Ok?
You listen to my advice, you' il end up like me, With nothing.
Come on, man, quit goofing around.
This is serious business.
We' re on a mission.
One great shoW can change the World.
Look out the WindoW.
- Mr. S!
Come doWn!
- Come on!
No Way.
That is so punk rock.
The dining- room table seats 1 4, With no inserts...
- What' s going on?
- We' ve got some rocking to do.

After everything he' s done to you?
That is so typical Ned.
When Will you stop being a pushover?
When are you finally gonna start sticking up for yourself?

I can admit it.
But you' re 1 0, and you' re better than me.
Your song rocks harder, so let' s play it.
But you knoW What?

This ain' t my band, it' s our band.
We all have a say.
We haven' t practiced that one as much.
I mean, We might not Win.
Hey, We didn' t come here to Win.
We came here to play one great shoW.
And on Zack' s song, you guys really rock.
You knoW my vote, Who else is With me?
All right, let' s pray.

I lost my love to the four winds save me now or when you find it fit
Save me...
Damn, too late to take a leak!
- The commercials are still on
Is your child a good singer and a talented performer?
If so, you may wish to enter this year' s Super Kid Contest!
Win a brand new car, and 20 000 euros tax- free
Call the number on the screen, and you' re in!
If Boy was still eight years old, he' d definitely win
Let' s just shorten him a little
You bloody moron!
Matula' s gonna get beaten up twice tonight.
- I say once
I' il bet 5 e on it.
- I say twice too
Once.
- Zero times
It' s the charm of the series
I say zero too
No more changing bets!
Isn' t that so, Dad?
- You play the cards that God dealt you
You heard him.
- And God just dealt me a wild card
- Which I' m using now!
This episode' s directed by Uli Möiler
3- 1 score!
You' il pay for the booze next month, or your head will roll
Hi, this is Marita from Babies Are Us Magazine...
Hello?
You just lost a subscriber!
Dad got the door open!
- Yes!
Hey, guys!
Come over here
You guys up for some free vodka?
- What the hell is this?
Not good enough for you, fancypants?
- It is, it is
- No, we didn' t
Sure about that?
Hello.
- Hello.
What can I get you?
Something to go with... crayfish
That would be white wine.
What price range were you thinking of?
Cheap, I mean... expensive
I' il see what we have.
You have to stay there
- Help!
Nobody move!
- Is this the end of my young life?
Help, he' s going to kill him!
- I' m too young to die!
I didn' t quite follow
- It' s a hold up.
I hear the Hounds of Hades barking on my heels!
Are you serious?
- Yes, I am
Help!
- But don' t call the police
Be quiet, dammit!
The cash register' s pretty empty this early in the day - but if you come back after the tourists have stopped by...
Fuck the tourists!
I need booze, a lot of it 30 cases of domestic vodka.
- I' m not sure we have it in stock
Make up for the rest with Russian!
- Would that be Stoli or...
Whatever.
Just take it easy in the meanwhile
I' il kill everyone if the cops show up!
You don' t see much of them around here
What a weirdo.
- You did good, Dad
With a little more practice, I' d have done even better
If we pull this through, we' il get you a role on Matula
Nope.
The gig is just getting to me
What the hell is taking so long?
Well, I' ve got to pack the bottles and the stockroom is a mess...
Go easy on it, boys
I thought you said you' d never drink again?
When the stuff' s this good, you can' t call it drinking
You' re sure about this?
Here, sons.
My silver medal drink.
- From the bartending contest?
Right, 1986.
- Who won?
Lehikoinen, but with jury tactics
Not the bartender from our pub?
- The same son of a bitch
Silverdick!
What did he do?
- Got the jury so drunk that - his halfwit brother was the only member sober enough to vote
There' s no justice in the world.
- Let' s drink to that
Don' t spill it on the register, Jussi' s gonna get mad
Will you be our driver?
Roots... roots... beet roots...!
Daddy, make me a new drink!
This one... kind of missed
Jussi!
- I' m sorry... bad back
Lade, hey.
Listen, son
You know how your brothers are...
Forget it, Dad.
We' il be fine
Right on
Look at them...
I say nothing.
You didn' t read me my rights
They only do that in America.
- And we' re not as good as them, eh?
I can' t go to jail, I already have a tattoo.
Cool, isn' t it?
How could I have recognized Dad he was wearing a mask?
So it was just a coincidence that the whole Hirvonen family was there?
We' re all kind of fond of booze
And the only place to get it the liquor store
I got so drunk in the end I wouldn' t recognized my own father
And I didn' t, did l?
What was the question?
Your father gets charged and the rest of you get the hell out of here
Thou shalt not play God
A man tried it once, with pretty ugly results
Erkki Valtteri Hirvonen will be to prison for 2 years
The other suspects are found guilty in lack of evidence - and are to be released
- No kidding?
Don' t be so cocky
Either you pay, or you die and pay
See him running with that ball and chain?
This ain' t funny
- And leave Dad in trouble?
You' re not worth shit without your father
And your landlord' s been looking for you.
10 e says Matula gets beaten up twice
And we die six times over.
- Six is my best bet too
We' re in mourning
Fuck off!
Situation over, Timo!
- Shut up
This just keeps getting better
You' ve got a healthy sister
Let' s throw her back in the staircase
I' ve got Celiac disease.
- What?
It means that bread makes her fart
Goodbye boredom.
- Hey guys, do we have any bread?
Help!
What' s wrong with her?
- What do you think?
Ask her wouldn' t she rather cry on the couch than behind it
Yeah, why don' t you just worry about that
Ask her yourself
I don' t speak Child.
Hey Bulk, do you speak Child?
No, but Lade does
Lade, hey.
We can speak child now
Leave it to us experts
This is where I sleep at home too.
- This is where she sleeps at home
You speak Child really well.
- Is she a child or a dog?
Lade, can you interpret?
- How the hell should I know?
What did you do as a kid when you were feeling bad?
Jumped on the bed, drank booze and went out stealing
Not necessarily in that order
And then my all time favorite... 360 degrees
Piranha river, piranha river...
Get lost, Lade
Hey, it' s Saara' s turn.
There' s not enough room for us all
You have to wait for your turn
Come on, try it
- There' s not enough room
OK, start jumping, just small bounces, hop, hop, hop...
I' il just jump here then
Then try higher.
Over the river and back
Watch out for the piranhas...
Higher, higher, 360 degrees!
Guys, we just need a plan.
- So start fucking making one
I' m gonna go pick a fight.
- With whom?
Anyone.
- Wait, I' il come with you
Where are you going?
- Anywhere
I brought the midget back.
Thanks very much for the loan
It' s his bastard.
He don' t pay, he takes care of her
- Try me
She' il let you in soon
So the others couldn' t make it?
I guess they' re scared.
It' s not easy when things change
I' il be okay here.
- Don' t worry, we' il sort it out
I just have to get the boys back in line - which may be more easily said than done
You never told us about Saara, then?
It was just a one- night stand
I didn' t find out about Saara until she was born
And by then I had my hands full with the four of you
I just never got around to it.
- She came over last night
That figures.
- Not a very cheerful child
Hardly surprising, if you look at her folks
But we' re her folks too!
Wanna fight?
- Sure
I bet you a cookie that the guy did it
The mutant.
- You' re on
Come back here!
Go Bulk, go...
Kill him!
Come on, get up!
The bottle return' s not working.
Here' s your deposit
The recycling machine won' t accept any bottles.
- I' il take a look at it
We' il come back later to see if it' s fixed.
- OK
Good work, Saara
Is that the first money you ever got?
No, the other 'up'
Chips or cheese puffs?
Cheese puffs.
So do I.
Can' t hear you!
The mike' s howling!
If you' re feeling alright, clap your hands!
- Clap in your pants!
I' ve got good news and bad news
First the bad news!
- No, first the good news!
I listed the bad news first
We' re broke, we' re on a hit list, and Dad' s in jail
But we have lots of chips and cheese puffs and...
Yeah, two whole bags.
One of each 16 liters of flat beer in a jerry can, save some for us, Bulk... and it tastes like diesel oil.
- Petrol
I said diesel oil.
- PETROL!
And save the condoms.
We can still use them
How can I talk when the whole house is falling apart around me?
Keep talking, it' s a great speech.
- We won' t interrupt anymore
You' re the family funny man.
- Let' s give him a little big hand
Go on, it' s a good speech.
- And then we have this new Korean...
CHlNESE!
Karaoke set. and a new family member
Thanks a hell of a lot.
Now that we' re done with warm- up, let the Karaoke contest begin
And now let' s see who' il be the first performer
- That' s me
He' il do a song called "Tears of Despair"
Yes, my name really is Eros Ramazotti
Take it away, Eros!
I wrote this song especially for tonight
It goes like this
You left, and the fields were flooding
The stars died out, and the wind was howling
The rivers were filled with tears of despair
This song is so Timo.
- And now the synthesizer
Oh home, sweet life...
How I love you...
I' ve got a terrible cold
Thank you, Bulk.
That' s okay.
You don' t have to
But let' s give Saara a big hand for helping with the party!
Ladies and gentlemen, here' s tonight' s main act...
This one goes to Dad
See the tree how big it' s grown but friend it hasn' t been too long it wasn' t big
I laughed at her and she got mad the first day that she planted it was just a twig
Then the first snow came and she ran out - to brush the snow away so it wouldn' t die
And I laughed 'til I cried...
It' s OK, we' il manage somehow.
We are the Hirvonens, after all!
Hell, I 'm a Hirvonen!
I' m a Hirvonen, you Hirvonen?
Me Hirvonen too...
Saara, come out.
You sang great, there' s nothing to be ashamed of
What' s going on here?
Go back to bed
I' ve gotta take a leak.
- Don' t shout, you' il scare her!
What are you, parent of the year?
- I' il explain in the morning
A miracle has happened.
- Better wash the coffee pot then - or you' il have cafe au miracle in the morning
Please come out
And now I present you our new super kid, Saara
Saara is going to sing us a song called "Love' s Last Farewell"
Press the button and it' il start
That' s one hell of an artist you signed up
When you have no idea what' s going on
At her pace you' il sell at least a hundred gigs a night
- Hell, yeah
So maybe it' s a stupid idea, but what have we got to lose?
I' m gonna go pick a fight
Well?
- I haven' t finished my Donald Duck
You really believe in that super kid shit?
- What' s there to lose?
If Pig and Sty see we' re trying, it could buy us some more time - while we think of something better.
- What say you, Brother Timo?
I' d see it as a better alternative than selling our internal organs
Give me a... pass... so...
- What?
GlVE ME A BACKSTAGE PASS SO I CAN TAKE A SHlT!
Did I articulate myself clearly enough?
I' m drawing helmets on the ducks
Lade, these are in alphabetical order.
- Look what I found
"Eagles don' t use stairs"
I' ve fucking had it!
Do you have any books that make kids go la- la?
We have some song books.
- Do they work?
In what way?
- Do they make kids go la- la?
It doesn' t work that way.
- So you don' t know, huh?
I wonder what you get paid for!
I made the logo of the employment office.
- It' s missing the spot
That looks better.
- I' m the Michelangelo of multivitamins
What... oh, great helmets!
- Now Donald won' t hurt his head
Listen: for healthy self- confidence, involve the child in daily tasks
I can teach her to fight, if someone else buys her the booze
They' re referring to a normal family, you idiot
Are you saying we' re not normal?
What' s normal, anyhow?
Dad' s in jail, four grown men living under the same roof...
Never done an honest day of work...
Between the four of us, we get laid once a year, if we' re lucky
We' d do a higher average if Boy did his bit
Now I eat the employment office
Hey, I found it child who refuses to do something developmentally essential - or doesn' t wish to learn some new, significant skill - can be inspired to do so in form of play
Huh?
- It' s singing time
I made you an employment office too
Did you now?
I' m not letting it burn!
How is it?
- C minus
Let me stir.
- I' il keep the stove on, then
Start setting the table.
- In form of play, remember?
You look cool with those crumbs flying out your mouth.
Hey Saara, let' s play this food game
The guys and I are murderers on our way to the gas chamber
And as our last wish, we ask for soup
Or Slurp, as we call it here
You' re the warden and you bring us spoons and plates...
And knives so we can cut each other' s stomachs open
You know what' s inside a human being?
All that great stuff like guts, we can use them as noodles...
Sounds fun, huh?
- Yeah, but it' s more like a boys' game
I' m a boy, I think.
- But she isn' t
You play with her then
His games have always been kind of violent
He' s the family idiot
- Do that trick!
"We girls can do anything..."
- "I come from hell..."
What' s with her?
- Spoiled shitless, that' s all
But the evil' s still in the woman!
Brother Bulk, pass the holy water!
Coming up!
"Vade retro spiritus... -
spiritus vade retro... "
Let go, you demon!
Saara, we have this little custom to sing a food song before eating
What' s the song called?
The Food Song.
I copied the words so we can all sing together
All rise
I wanna learn it by heart.
- Just read it from the paper
But I have musical ambitions.
- Stand up, smartass
Well, if we' re in a rush.
- On the count of four: one, two...
I can smell the food
The eggs are frying on the pan, then I run so fast, oh man
Hey, that' s enough.
Knock it off
... Then I run so fast, oh man.
See, I learned it by heart!
And without using your hands.
I won
You shouldn' t pick on someone smaller
Wanna stay hanging up there for the rest of the day?
I' m gonna throw up on you.
- Hey Lade, she' s one of us!
You have to guess who' s singing on tape
Let' s start with the first sample
That was you.
- Yup, it was me
Here' s the next one
Roots... beet roots...
It must be a monster.
- It was Sepultura
Or at first it was... but then I improvised
Let' s give Timo a little big hand
And now to our last contestant...
Where' s the sarcasm now, Bulk?
Great soundtrack for the snuff film we' il make about you
The song' s not bad
The voice was a bit hissy.
- Might be due to the microphone
What do you say?
- Let' s talk
When' s the contest?
- Halfway through August
How much can you get from it?
- Twenty grand
You' il pay us fifteen in August, or you' re dead
Snuffed out
Snuffed indeed
How much time do we have?
- 3 weeks, and that' s the good news
The kids are selected for regional trials on the basis of the tapes
And in the finals they have also interviews and a talent section
What the hell is that?
A display of a child' s talent in an optional field
Drinking, stealing and farting excluded
Shit, our special fields of expertise.
- I was kidding, moron
Phew.
I' d hate to see a good case of Celiac disease wasted
This won' t work otherwise
Saara hey, come here.
Housing Department form
Did you see my lollipop?
- A froggypop!
Put it away or she' il go mad.
- It' s my froggypop
You' re not thinking of asking that singing barfly to help us?
Remember as kids when Mom took us to see her sing at the mall?
The mall sucks.
Security cameras everywhere
Well, it' s not like we did do much stealing back then.
- Nope
Laura drove
Quit showing your ass to everybody, you slut!
Hey, wanker!
Hey, it' s the Faggot Brothers.
Looking for a blowjob?
Looks like all you need is an onion ring around your dick, to make a fine Greek salad
It' s the Feta cheese in a Greek salad, you moron
You' re gonna fucking die now!
No one asked you anything
Sit the fuck down!
We' d like to speak to the lady here
No animals allowed in here
Your company can' t be worse than them for an old kebab like me
Old kebab?
- Meat gone around, half cow, half sheep
Is that an old saying?
- I just made it up
Wow!
What a beautiful voice.
- Would you coach her?
I' ve quit the music scene
Say hi to your father from me
Bulk, come on out!
Remember the legwork, you have to keep moving
When Bulk moves, you move!
Saara hey, you can' t stop.
Keep the legs moving!
Now in time with the music, faster!
Go, go, keep the rhythm.
Keep spinning, don' t stop!
Close the gap!
Who' s gonna get this trophy?!
Don' t let him get near you!
Start moving your mouth towards the ears
As high up as you can, higher...
All the way up to the ears, showing your teeth...
Now flash your teeth
Not like a grimace but more relaxed...
Now pull the sides of your mouth ever ever closer to the ears...
And don' t forget to blink your eyes
Now!
There' s a smile!
And now a series of punches.
Great, and Bulk falls down
Put your foot on top him
And then the smile
It' s a good start
Here goes...
And now do the boxing stuff.
Box to the tune of the song
Not the one with the mike
Like when you won the match
Now turn around slowly.
- I can' t, I need to see the words
Just turn around bravely
Look up at us
She fainted
At least the mike' s still working
This Karate Kid method of yours is a real killer
I' ve had it with you pissass bums!
You guys could at least try!
Give me a Christmas Special, Lehikoinen
So you came here looking for trouble?
- Yeah... like a tattoo here saying "Juhis and Laura forever"...
You can always have the arm cut off...
Oh shit, that fucking queen wants you!
OK, boys.
Let' s beat the shit out of that faggot!
Aren' t you guys so tough.
- Yeah, and hard in the right places
- In your dreams
It turns me on.
All set?
- All set
Laura!
- Hi.
What are you doing here?
Thought you might use the backdoor.
- Oh?
- Sorry, but I' m done with music
If you can' t face your past, you' il find it in your future
What the fuck do you think you know about my past?
I' m sorry
And the book where I read that line sucked, anyhow
Got a light?
Crappy flat, lousy food, ugly and horny flatmates...
You get two grand if we win, to give you a fresh start
That' s a really shitty offer
You' ve got an hour to pick up your stuff
I saw the homo hop in there
Let' s go
Laura
And the next one' s Boy.
- Hi, I' m Boy
- Hi.
Laura... hi...
Hl.
- Hi
Anyone want the rest?
So what do we do now?
- Have you told her your plan?
We have like... sort of hinted...
- So you haven' t told her anything?
- Good.
Does she drink coffee?
Yeah, with lots of milk and two sugars
- No
Bulk, stop staring!
I mean it
Good Morning
It' s okay, I just brought you some coffee
I' m Laura, I' m a friend of the boys
I' m Saara.
- Hi Saara
Are the boys nice?
Well, Lade' s nice.
But Timo' s kind of weird
What have you guys been doing?
- Singing and fighting
It sounded really beautiful
You must like singing?
I get scared when there' s someone listening
Would you let me teach you?
Their singing is awful, and they never stop
OK, I promise.
- For sure?
For sure
The trick is not to think about the audience at all
Just pick one nice person in the audience whom you sing to
And when you see that that one person likes your show - you know everyone else likes it too
What if he doesn' t like it?
- Don' t worry, he will
If I had Boy with me when I was trying to pick up a girl - she' d keep her eyes fixed on him, and I could feel her up in the meantime
Man, you guys are stupid!
Are you ready?
We' il try it alone first
Lade' s the nice one.
Nice Lade.
Could I take these home to be fitted?
- For 24 hours only
Can I see your I. D.?
We' il be expecting them back tomorrow.
- Sure, thanks
Could you...?
- I' il come and show it to you
I' m taking these home to be fitted.
The girl must have missed a tag
Let' s go and check the files
What name is it under?
- Hirvonen.
So it seems.
- It' s good to keep an eye on things
- Yeah, it happens sometimes
A performing outfit for my sister.
- Thank you
Thanks a lot.
- Bye
You' re supposed to guess how many times Mr. Matula gets beaten up
And the one who comes the closest gets all the cookies
This is such a thrill, really the highlight of the week
Well I say zero times.
- I say zero too
Me too.
- Judas
Zero times.
I mean... three times
Still wanna change your bet?
- Make it zero
Look at the nice person
And now smile a little
Baywatch passing gas?
- I' m the bailiff asking for cash
I just wanna see if you' re wearing a wire
You look like you jumped right out of a German detective series
Go away now
Your rent is due.
You' il have to pay.
Say hi to your mom!
He' s still there
You mean that if we don' t give you the money.
Big guys will come in and carry out your stuff
A wave for the big guys!
How big are the big guys?
Now get your ass down the stairs, and we pretend you never existed
I will not leave.
- Sure as hell you will!
You can' t get to sleep?
Are you worried?
About what?
- All kinds of stuff
- No, or...
I' m not sure
I hate it there and like it here, but everything' s just so strange
Should we go see your friends tomorrow?
I haven' t got any
You' ve got me, and those idiots in the next room
We can go see them in the kitchen tomorrow.
- That' s what we' il do
And hey... thanks, Saara.
- What for?
Just thanks.
- Shall we sleep now?
Yeah, let' s sleep.
Dear guests of honor -
I present you Saara, the next Super Kid of the year
Give her a nice round of applause, or we' il be getting back to you
I can say thank you from language to language - and bid greetings to you all
But I can' t catch a star that shines in the early dawn
I can bear hardness and hardship keep quiet if that' s my call
Leave a wreath on the grave and keep going on
Save me if it' s on the line.
Save me, save me...
What song are you going to sing?
"Loves Last Farewell"
It' s a great song
I welcome you all to the 2003 Super Kid Eastern Finland Trials
10 promising young performers have been selected here - on the basis of the tapes they have sent in
Saara Mäkinen is the best!
And our jury members today are...
Marilyn, Marilyn, if I could turn back the time
The old folks tell tales of how the devil...
The cat broke its ribs, when it played, meow, meow...
Thank you, that was very nice.
Let' s give Maria a round of applause
And coming up next we have lida!
Hey, get back to your seat
No platonic feelings, I long for romance
Romeo and Juliet is the name of the game...
Innocence prevails, I love you in the dark...
And now to our last contestant, Saara Mäkinen!
And now it' s finally time to declare the winner of our trials
Has the jury reached a decision?
Yes, it seems it has!
And here comes Super Bunny too!
Yes, and the winner is...
Saara Mäkinen!
The show was great, we heard it on the radio!
I never thought anything good would come out of you
Shut up, Airi, or you won' t get any homebrew tonight!
You' re good boys!
Not last week we weren' t!
Keep it down, it' s Dad
Say hi from us.
- Yes, yes!
The boys say hi and yes yes
It went really well
Yeah, the classical style...
She' s right here, hold on.
He wants to talk to you
Yes
Well, what did he say?
- That I did good
You know what?
You were fantastic!
But it must have been hard?
- I was so nervous
No one could have ever guessed.
I was always really nervous before going on stage
Was it your job to sing?
Hey, let' s go see what the boys are up to
There' s so many people there
Sure.
Let' s go
Now we have a celebrity living in our building!
Can I have your attention please?
Thanks.
I would like to quote the famous singer.
- It' s pronounced "loois"
You, Saara - may be a small girl to mankind but a big girl to us Eastsiders
I wrote it to sound natural... to borrow a metaphor from...
- Don' t forget to return it later!
We have at least fifty liters of homebrew, so fill up, folks!
And if it gets to your stomachs, go crap in your own toilets!
That means you too, Airi!
- Excellent speech!
Did you miss Mommy?
Why did you run away like that?
Why did you run away?
Hey, Mom' s not mad at you...
Get lost, cow!
- Knock it off, dammit!
Take it easy now.
She' s the child' s custodian, after all
She' s just afraid that I' m angry.
- That ugly imitation of a mother?!
And you Mam, cut the crap, so we can get this done with
We' re going home
You' il be fine, as long as you just don' t sing
Let' s go.
- I' il be seeing you!
The party' s over!
It means you too, Airi.
Get your ass out of here
Lade, hey...
When this super kid crap started even I wasn' t sure about it myself
I just had to think of something to keep the boys from falling apart
Hey, the guys are doing great, and Saara' s had the time of her life
But the end result... total shit
Come to bed with me
Good Morning.
- You know what?
It' s almost possible to like you.
- A close call, huh?
Should we go see what' s going on?
It' s probably just Bulk customizing furniture in his horny Neanderthal fit
Let go of my brother!
- Hey guys, stop it!
Calm down!
Let go, will you
Now what the fuck is going on here?
You' il have lots of room to make love after I throw out your stuff
You go on making love in your pocket!
You guys are out of here tonight, either voluntarily or feet first
Nobody' s gonna take me out feet first!
Die mutant!
And you get the fuck out of here, fast!
- Put the god damn bunny away
Timo, be a nice boy and put the bunny away
No surrender!
- No surrender either!
Take me to your leader!
- Excuse me?
Better do as the UFO man says or he' il nuke you
We' d like to see the store manager.
- You heard him, act!
Did I get this right?
You wish to make a sponsorship deal - where you would be granted the use of a warehouse as rehearsal space - with electricity, running water, showers, kitchen...... and a VCR
Exactly.
- VHS
And in return, you would wear caps with the company logo - promote our teamwork and...
The gay person here wears a scarf.
Naturally we need a van for transportation of equipment
We can do promotional rounds in your parking lot if you want
Like Kimi Räikkönen.
- Right
And we' il cry when they play the National Anthem.
- Like Kimi
And after the contest Saara will be obliged to perform in the mall - every day for a period of one week, 4 x 45 minutes per day...
What?
- It' s our procedure
Hartonen will look after the details
Way to go, Hartonen!
Well, I' ve got things to do, so thanks and goodbye
Don' t mention it, you are welcome
And please return the jackets on your way out
Have you noticed, ever since we took up honest work - everyone' s been wanting to beat the shit out of us?
What?
- No shagging in here
Say goodbye to live porn
Go ahead and shag!
Aren' t they kind of cute?
- No, they' re not
Yes, we are!
A man in love is an ugly sight.
- Shit, lets drink to that
Great housewarming party!
Shit, it' s a walrus!
Me make art
I' m not gonna pay twice for the tiles if they keep falling off...
It' s Hirvonen!
See you moved in next door.
- I guess we fucking did
We were just thinking of paying you a visit
What a great coincidence.
Stay right there...... we have a wonderful housewarming gift for you
It' s perfect for your new shithole flat
Oh, I got it... shithole...
Fucking hell!
- What is it?
It' s a piece of Dad' s ass, with Mom' s name tattooed on it
Oh God!
- Dad never had a tattoo on his ass
Not as far as I remember.
- I thought he had one
Well he certainly doesn' t anymore
Why don' t you jerks just stay here and speculate while I go kill those...
Get away from me!
Let go of me, Bulk!
Someone' s gonna die!
I just don' t give a shit anymore!
I' m not letting you get yourself killed
Don' t think we don' t appreciate what you' re doing
But we' re not gonna come running to thank you
What did you just say?
Sing Mommy a little song
Just a small one, just to stay in tune
Come on, have a cookie.
Sing us a song
Haven' t you got any respect for your mother?
She gave birth to you, bought the cookies and everything
Let' s hear you sing
Give me that cigarette...
I brought you to this world with blood and tears - you have no idea what it' s like
I' m asking you to sing, and you bloody hell refuse to
You are driving me fucking crazy
I' m gonna start kicking that bastard around soon.
Spoiled little brat...
She just wants to hear her baby sing
Mommy loves you so much
Hey, guys.
Did you like the gift?
Yeah, we gave it to Bulk as an advance on his inheritance
We dropped by for coffee, now that we are neighbors
Bring out the artist for a matinee.
- She happens to be...
She' s visiting her Mom
What do we do now?
- We can have Chinese take- away
We' il chop, but you ain' t gonna sue!
You' re an ugly fucker, but tell me... which is your prettier half?
I' m the prettier half!
- Stop it!
Hi there, everyone.
- Well hiya- fuckin- ho
I see you' ve got company
Hi, I' m Saara' s Mom!
So, how are things?
- Fucking great
Get your ass out of here, bitch
Shut up, slut!
Mommy' s going to drop by and see you soon
I' m the single parent seal, and you' re the puppy seal
And they go to visit Bob the Polar Bear - and his newborn baby
How do the hands go?
But they' re called flippers
Now let' s go
Here comes a Norwegian seal hunter to kill the seals...
You can' t have my baby!
- The puppy' s just what I' m after
Watch out, boys!
Watch out!
Happy Birthday, Saara
But it' s not my birthday
Since you' ve never had a birthday party - we wanted to make up for it before you reach the big ten
There' s at least a hundred candles on it
Forty- five, for each candle missed so far
Now blow them out, quickly!
- Blow, blow... excellent!
Here you are.
- Thank you
Here you are.
It' s kind of silly, so can you open it later?
Wow, they' re great
Aren' t they kind of alike?
It doesn' t matter, because this guy doll is the magician - and the girls are his assistants.
And because they all look alike - they can be in different places all at once
That' s just what we had in mind
Remember those tricks you used to show us as a kid?
Do you have names for the dolls?
What tricks?
Tell us, tell us, tell us!
I knew a few stupid magician' s tricks as a kid, nothing...
They were supergreat!
At least better than that song, remember...
Show us a trick.
- Show us, show us, show us!
It' s been so long
How did you do that?
- A magician never tells his secret
Remember the contest?
Shit, I' d forgotten all about that talent section
Will you teach me?
Starting now
You know what, Laura?
- What?
I' m so happy
Bleed, ye Christians!
Go Timo, go!
OK, time to sleep
Thank you
Let' s tuck in
Good Night.
- Good Night.
Good Night, guys
Good Night, Saara!
Good Night, Lade!
- Good Night, Saara!
- Good Night, Timo!
Good Night, Boy!
Good Night, Laura!
- Good Night, Boy!
And then you switch sides, you pull it tight...
Make it tight, and I' il put my hands...
Hi there.
- Hiya ho
Show Mom your little trick.
Go on, boys
How' bout you leave us alone?
We' re just practicing
You won' t let me stay and watch my little girl perform?
She and I have a long career ahead of us after the contest
Hey, it' s just this one gig and we promised you a share.
You think I' d let scum like you take all the cream off the cake?
In your dreams, sonny.
- You bloodsucking leech!
Shut up, prick.
Show Mommy.
- Get the hell out of here!
Take your hands off me!
Get out!
You seem kind of worried again
Are you nervous about the contest?
- No, but I...
What are you worried about?
I don' t want to be a singer
I really appreciate that you' ve been teaching me and stuff...
And I don' t want to leave the boys in trouble
And if I win, I get to go to the amusement park
But I never thought about what' s going to happen afterwards
You think your Mom was serious?
- Yes, and it' s going to be so awful
Everything' s going to be alright
Lade, hey...
- I' m so fucking stupid
I never thought that witch would come up with plans for Saara
I should have known if anyone
Whatever happens in the contest, we lose
So which one do we sacrifice, Dad or Saara?
We' il think of something
Should I be proud of you?
Yes!.... or damn if I know...
We' re going to the amusement park!
- Good!
How' s the backside?
Well, it still gives a flat imitation of a bagpipe
Better than nothing
What do you think will happen after all this is over?
But let' s not think about it yet
Everything will turn out fine.
- You just have to seize the moment
My life has really changed since I left home
I used to sleep on a mattress on the floor
And you know what?
You couldn' t jump on it!
Know what?
I happen to be a champ at this!
"Have you ever seen green and red dots?" - I do now
Look, you can see them if you go like this
- Room service!
Timo, you know they show porn on cable TV?
- That' s tasteless
Porn is tasteless?
Now Bulk is gonna say that he' s having the time of his life
I' m a sensitive summer dude
God, these kiddy bottles really mess you up
But luckily I brought their daddy along
"Have you ever collected ants?"
- "Only when I used to collect ants"
"Have you ever drank up a whole glass of water?"
"Only after mistaking salt for sugar"
Hey, for a bunch of idiots we' re not such total idiots
Yes, we are.
And here' s to it!
Daddy bottle, kiddy bottle...
Please stay seated, we are about to go on air
Ladies and Gentlemen, parents of the contestants - all our TVviewers, welcome to the finals of the Super Kid Contest!
Let' s give them a nice round of applause!
A brand new Opel Astra with 20 000 euros in the backseat
And here to assure that everything happens by the book are two - officers of the law, constables Risto Mikkonen and Arto Nordström
My name is Veera.
- I' m Saara
Hey kids!
- Yeah, where' s Winnie the Pooh?
Winnie- the- poop is in your pants!
Boys are so stupid.
- Yeah, or not all of them
The trick I am about to perform requires two volunteers
How about you two gentlemen in the front row?
Please hold the ends, and then switch sides, tighten the rope
And do the same again.
To make me more comfortable
Now you press the top, and you make a knot
You appear to be wearing a perfect magic jacket
Could you put it on top here, being that my hands are tied?
And now Ladies and Gentlemen, do you believe - that I can untie myself on a count to ten?
No!
In that case, start counting!
- One, two, three...
Stop, stop...
A little slower, please
Like this: one, two...
Sir, could you please stop speaking on the cell phone?
I' m trying to concentrate here
This is not working out.
Can you please carry me out?
So Pasi, what do you value the most in life?
I guess that would be my hamster
Without them I wouldn' t be here today
Well, what would we do without charming hosts like you?
And what do you, Saara, value the most in life?
My brothers and Laura, who is my best friend
And what are you going to become when you grow up?
Isn' t it a bit too early to tell?
Do you have a cell phone?
Can I have your address so I can write to you?
I don' t really have an address either
How come?
Everyone I know has an address
It' s a long story.
But I can write to you first
Oh God, I' m so nervous
And our next contestant is...
Oh no!
- You' il do great
Something' s gotten hold of my heart keeping my soul and my senses apart
Something' s gotten into my life cutting its way - through my dreams like a knife
Turning me up and turning me down
Making me laugh and making me frown
In a world that was small I once lived in a time - there was peace with no trouble at all
But then you came my way and a feeling unknown shook my heart - made me want you to stay all of my nights and all of my days
I gotta tell you now
Saara, are you okay?
What happened?
Dammit!
There goes the money
Everyone, please keep calm
All the excitement must have been too much for her
And now while we' re waiting, a few words about our sponsors...
How can you talk about sponsors when a little girl just fainted!
Anything might have happened!
Shame on you!
Have you no feelings at all?
What' s there to applaud?
Sure they did, but my son made a great speech
The production company doesn' t wish to make an issue out of this
I have here an official apology - obliging you not to give any press interviews
Sign right there
It' s a pity though.
This really killed her chances in show biz
We' il just have to live with that
Can we leave now?
It' s not really a police matter.
Wow, we pulled off one hell of a talent section, didn' t we?!
We just do the interviews tomorrow, and then we' re in the clear
It pissed me off though that the car wasn' t even locked
Lade' s speech was so touching I almost cried
And I nearly forgot to steal the money
How did you manage to keep a straight face backstage?
It wasn' t easy, believe me.
I didn' t even dare look at Lade
Unfortunately this really killed your chances in show biz
Hey, it was a joke
Gotcha!
I should become an actress
Don' t ever do that again
And you' re not even ten yet, so it' s too early to tell
I made that up myself because that host was such a jerk
His questions were so stupid
Let' s give a nice round of applause to Saara from Joensuu!
You were fantastic!
Pearls for Pigs and Sties
Saara, your share of the money is in the same locker as Laura' s
You two can do something fun with it together
I' il kick your ass if you start crying
The same goes for you too
And me too
Cool!
You' re wasting your time on us.
We' re on the same side as you
The guys and I were thinking of starting a detective agency
It' s still under development, but we' ve thought up a slogan:
"If nature calls, we' il tap the line and arrange surveillance"
Kind of like Matula, but specialized in bodily fluids
Really, I almost fainted when I saw her faint.
She was doing so great
Did you see that Jenni Whomever doing the ballet?
Stuck in this Victorian type scenario
You lost the money yourselves, and now you try to frame us
I saw a movie where the same thing happened
The cops were charged, the chair sparked and the Hound of Hades barked
And it wasn' t even a nature film
Do you work out?
The bad cop routine is not gonna work on me...
Do you like nature films?
I guess not, since nature doesn' t - draw a line between good and evil.
It puts the police out of business
I' m not speaking, not even if you cut my head off
Actually, especially not then.
Hey, a joke!
You ever watch Matula?
It' s a German detective series.

What you get is what you see
And you can bet it' s worth it, baby
'Cause what you get is me
lf you only knew what I just dealt with.
I mean, this guy was right in front of me, going little...
That guy deserves a ticket.
I' m sure he' s...
A- A- A woman never reveals her age.
I' ve been in this relationship for...
He was going ten miles an hour on the highway.
I' m trying to...
"And only then will the people of Tajikistan know true and lasting peace."
Andie, it' s brilliant.
It' s really moving.
But it' s never going to appear in Composure Magazine.
God, I busted my butt in grad school to be Andie Anderson, "How to" girl, and write articles like,
Really Have More Fun? "
like politics and the environment, and foreign affairs -- things I' m interested in.
Keep busting your butt.
You' re going to get there.
Hey, I' ve got something to cheer you up.
You know that editor from Sports illustrated that you have been shamelessly flirting with on the phone for... whoo, a month now?
He made a little delivery this morning.
Ah, ha, ha, let me see.
Oh, no.
Hey!
Tomorrow night.
What happens tomorrow night?
Only the most exhilarating and artistic display of athletic competition known to mankind.
The lce Capades are in town?
No, the NBA Finals are in town, and I got tickets!
Come with me?
All right, I' il go.
But I am not putting out.
Two stale jumbo dogs and a couple of beers, you' il be whistling a different tune.
You know what I like.
Good morning, ladies.
Don' t forget, staff meeting in 30 minutes.
Michelle -- haven' t seen her all morning.
- Have you?
- Ten to one she' s wallowing.
It' s my turn.
I' il get her, you get the coffee, meet me in the corner in 20.
Wait, wait, wait.
Here, take some samples.
Samples.
Samples.
Great idea.
Oh, boy.
Drama, drama, drama.
Hello, Ben.
Hey, hey, good morning, Spears.
What are you reading, girl?
You catching up on your current events?
"Turn- On Tricks:
How to Make Him Hot. "
You know, if you want to try those out sometime, we should get together.
Green and I have an appointment at Composure, the fastest growing women' s magazine in the country.
And seeing as how our clients run a lot of our campaigns in their nationally- syndicated little girlie magazine, it wouldn' t hurt you to do a little reading.
Hey, Benny.
Good morning, Green.
You finally decided to show up?
Yes, I did.
You ready?
Ready.
Later, Ben.
Have a nice day, ladies.
Hi.
Oh!
Good morning, sunshine.
Okay, get dressed.
Get dressed.
Staff meeting, 15 minutes.
Let' s go.
I' m going back to bed.
I have no reason to live.
Sun' s out.
Oh...
Okay, just...
Okay, now...
Cashmere?
Put it on.
It' il make your eyes look fiercely green.
Oh!
Get up.
I' m not going to let you lose your job on top of everything else.
- Oh.
- Come here.
Oh, Andie.
Okay.
You only dated the guy a week.
It was the best week of my life.
Sweetheart.
Good morning, ladies.
Warren Advertising.
Good morning.
What' s up, kitty cat?
What' s up, daddy?
Big night?
- Not bad.
- Orgy?
Where were you, man?
Not at an orgy.
Did you hear?
What, that my Knickerbockers are now in the championship series and Tone "The Bone" here owes me $20?
Pay him.
Oh, man.
Well, you were right.
DeLauer Diamonds is looking for a new ad agency.
Yes!
Oh, oh, this is a good day, this is a good day.
Guys, did you know that diamonds are about as common as taxis on Fifth Avenue?
The value is entirely sentimental, maintained by a supply, demand and advertising.
Stripes.
Now, DeLauer dominates the world diamond market.
I basically represent the entire industry.
Tell him.
What?
Warren gave it to the Judys.
Spears and Green -- they' re already on it.
No way!
Yeah, well, you know, he' s kind of partial to hot, leggy chicks for some reason.
Yeah, and we' re the, you know, the sneakers and beer division.
Precious gems aren' t exactly our forte.
Lips and Hips are over at a chick' s magazine right now.
I got to get to Warren before they sink...
You can' t, you can' t.
He' s on a plane.
Easy, pal.
The Chicago meeting.
And it' s too late anyway, because Warren' s meeting them for drinks at Mullins' tonight to discuss their ideas.
This isn' t happening.
This was my tip.
It' s going to be my pitch, my account, my campaign.
- This is my baby.
- That' s what I' m talking about.
They will not ace me out of this.
- That' s right.
- I heard that.
Okay.
Mullins', tonight.
"I heard that"?
- Hi.
- Hi.
l- I don' t really want to talk about it, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
Okay.
Why does this always happen to me?
Things were going great for, like, a week and a half, and then, all of a sudden, it' s over, and I am mystified.
Seriously, I am mystified, because it always starts out so well.
Poor baby.
Let' s just roll with this one.
Oh, Mike and I had such a connection.
I cried.
You cried?
Yeah.
You mean, like, one glistening tear on your cheek, right?
No.
I was really emotional.
I even told him that I loved him.
After how many days?
Five.
Two.
It was how I felt.
I wanted to express myself.
Okay, well, what did he say?
Oh, Mike didn' t have to say anything.
I know that he felt the same.
But then he started getting really busy, and I didn' t know where he was.
So I kept calling him and calling him.
You kept calling him?
I didn' t leave a message.
He didn' t know it was me.
My number' s blocked.
Oh, l- I' m sure he thought it was one of his friends.
You know, men frequently call their friends' answering machines and hang up 20 times.
Anyway...
I know why he dumped me:
I' m too fat.
- You' re not fat!
Oh, Michelle, if the most beautiful woman in the world acted the way you did, any normal guy would still go running in the other direction.
Oh, no.
No guy would go running from you, Andie.
You could barf all over him, and he would say, "Do it again."
That is both incredibly disgusting and categorically untrue.
lf I did the things you did, I' d get dumped, too.
Okay, family, shoes off.
And breathe.
Out.
Okay, Lori, let' s start with you.
Well, the "Botox for Beginners" piece is done.
Now, it' s a little scary, but mostly upbeat.
"What Your Gyno Won' t Tell You," which is also pretty scary, but, you know, upbeat.
I finished my research on deadly pedicures, about the woman who contracted that fungus from the unsterilized tools.
It' s a terrible story.
Although, surprisingly... upbeat!
Marvelous.
What' s next for "'How to' with Andie"?
Well, I' ve been working on something that' s kind of different.
It' s a political piece, and it' s...
No.
Andie, you work at Composure Magazine.
We are fashion, trends, diets, cosmetic surgeries, salacious gossip -- that' s Composure.
- Okay, but...
- Look,
Andie, okay -- the column is new for you.
When you turn it into a must- read, then you can write about whatever you want.
Until then, you can write about whatever I want.
Understood?
Yeah.
Michelle, what have you got?
I wasn' t feeling very well...
She got dumped.
Michelle...
What a hellish ordeal for you.
But I must say, you are looking fabulous.
Are we loving the way she looks, all?
- We love the way she looks.
- Oh, you are so right.
She looks great.
Well, I haven' t eaten since the split.
Good for you!
Write about it.
I can' t use my personal life for a story.
I understand completely.
Who will use Michelle' s personal life for a story?
Oh, I will.
- No, no, no,
I can' t let her.
- I am...
- I' il do it.
What?
I' il sort of do it.
You will be my inspiration.
For?
Look at Michelle.
- She is a great girl, right?
- Yes.
An amazing woman.
But she has a problem hanging onto relationships, and doesn' t really know what she' s doing wrong, which is like a lot of our readers.
So, I was thinking that I could start by dating a guy, and then drive him away, but only using the classic mistakes most women, like Michelle, make... all the time.
I' il keep a diary of it, and it will be sort of a... dating "How to" in reverse.
What not to do.
Yeah.
"How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days."
Go.
Bart, what' s new in the shoe world?
Wait, wait, Lana, I' m sorry.
Why ten days?
Yes?
Okay, what we found out is men are attracted to purple shoes.
Maybe toss in something spiritual as well.
Who' s that chic Buddhist Richard Gere cavorts with?
The Dalai Lama.
Ah!
Here' s my 10: 00.
Welcome.
Ladies, Judy Spears and Judy Green from Warren Advertising.
We' re going to cook up some fabulous tie- ins for the fall.
Jeannie Ashcroft, Fashion and Trends.
Michelle Rubin, Fitness and Health.
Excuse me.
Hi.
And Andie Anderson, our resident "How to" girl.
Oh, I' ve seen your column, Andie.
What are you working on now?
"How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days."
She' s actually going to start dating a guy, and then drive him away in a week and a half.
Sounds needlessly vicious.
It' s going to be fabulous.
Now all she has to do is run along and find the lucky guy.
- Bye.
Find the guy.
- Okay.
- Find the guy.
Oh, you are never going to pull this off.
Watch me.
Tomorrow, pull the switch.
I' m going to have this guy running for his life.
You' re not going to burn his apartment down or bite him or anything, are you?
No!
I' m going to limit myself to doing everything girls do wrong in relationships.
Basically, everything we know guys hate.
I' il be clingy, needy...
- Be touchy- feely.
Ooh, call him in the middle of the night, and tell him everything you had to eat that day.
What' s wrong with that?
I' m kidding.
Hello, Ben.
What are you doing here?
Ladies.
But you weren' t invited.
Yeah, but I should have been.
I mean, it was my tip that DeLauer' s shopping for a new firm.
Yes, it was, but I have to think in terms of who' s best- suited within the company team.
Yes, sir, and that' s me.
I want to handle this pitch.
Ben, you sell Joe Blow better than anyone else in my shop, but these girls sell luxury better than anyone else in the business.
We have to put our best foot forward on this pitch.
DeLauer would be our biggest account.
Yes, sir, they would.
Annual advertising billings of 50 - to $60 million.
And I am the man that' s going to bring this home for you, Phil.
Why this place?
It' s perfect.
Mullins' is the apres- work watering hole for the upwardly mobile.
Now, to date, the diamond industry has always targeted men, sending the message that the woman needs the man to buy her the rock.
All right, they say, "A diamond is forever."
We say, "A diamond is for everyone."
Yes.
We don' t.
"A diamond is for everyone" sends the message that diamonds are everywhere, which means they' re not rare, and if they' re not rare, they lose their status.
Status is the reason to buy them in the first place, which Benjamin would know if he understood women, which you don' t.
No man does.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Sorry.
Thanks.
She' s perusing.
Hmm.
Selling a diamond to a woman is like making her fall in love.
She has to feel giddy, desirous, adventurous, and desperate.
Take a look around this room, Phillip.
Most of the women in this bar are looking for just that.
Exactly.
The skills required to market diamonds are the same as those needed to make a woman fall in love, yes.
I' m not talking about lust.
A woman in lust wants chocolate.
A woman in love... wants diamonds.
Yeah, I' m not talking about lust, either, ladies.
let' s grow old together, L- O- V- E.
I do.
Whether they' re four, 40, or my 88- year- old grandmother,
I respect women, all right?
And I also listen... to women, and that' s why I can sell myself to any woman, anywhere, anytime.
Make a woman fall in love with diamonds, Benjamin... or with you?
Eh, either one.
Well, that' s cocky, Ben.
No, not cocky -- confident.
I' d like to see you prove that.
You would?
The agency' s cohosting a party for the DeLauers at the Astor Museum.
The party' s a week from Sunday.
Do you think you could make a woman fall in love with you by then?
Ten days?
Any woman, anywhere, anytime?
Any single, available, straight woman -- yes.
Yes.
I' m not trying to trick you, Ben.
ln fact, we' il choose a woman right here, right now, in this bar, and then you decide.
So, who' s the lucky girl?
Let' s see here.
Ooh, there' s that blonde babe in the leopard print.
She looks like fun.
Be nice, ladies.
Miss Babylon Five.
Now, she' s on the prowl.
Her.
Her who?
Her, in the gray dress.
Blonde hair.
Pretty smile.
Her?
Done.
What?
Done.
Okay?
- Very cute.
Here I go!
Okay, you' re on.
But here are the stakes.
After I win this bet, this pitch is mine.
Agreed.
- Phil?
- Agreed.
You come to that party with a girl that' s really in love with you, Ben... you can make the pitch to the DeLauers.
But, Phillip, you can' t...
I' ve made up my mind.
To the DeLauers.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Cheers.
I was just wondering if you find...... exciting?
Yes.
My wife and I love New York, especially this time of year.
She' d been here before, and I' d...
- Hi.
- Hi.
This is Andie.
You guys enjoy New York.
Thanks.
We will.
Good luck!
Thank you, Phil.
I have a bet to win.
Now do you want to tell me what' s going on?
You don' t recognize her?
Hi.
Hi.
Andie Anderson.
I' m Benjamin Barry.
Cute.
Thank you.
I meant your name.
Thank you two times.
Unattached?
Currently.
Likewise.
Surprising.
Psycho?
Rarely.
lnterested?
Perhaps.
Hungry?
Starving.
- Leaving.
- Now?
Okay.
One second.
I' il meet you at the door.
Hey, hey, guys.
What?
I think I got one.
He was married.
No, not him.
It' s the guy by the door, but don' t- don' t look.
He is really cute!
I' m going to check this one out and see if he' s the keeper.
Okay.
And if he is?
Flip the switch.
Doing this for you.
Well, good luck.
Call me.
Drama, drama, drama.
No, no, no.
This one.
And you get to wear the goofy- looking helmet.
This won' t look goofy on me.
It looks goofy on just about everybody.
Look at you.
That' s pretty damn cute.
There you go.
You ready to go for a ride, Andie?
Are you ready to go for a ride, Ben?
Get it?
Yeah.
So, what do you think?
About the food, or... you?
Both.
Mm- hmm.... and I' m still deciding.
Anything I can do to help?
Yeah, you could answer some questions for me, actually.
"Some" sounds a little too indefinite.
I' il give you three.
What do you do for a living?
I' m in advertising.
I work mostly with alcoholic beverage and athletic equipment companies, and I' m trying to break into the jewelry market right now.
Saving the world, one keg party at a time?
Yeah, something like that.
What about you?
What about me?
Have I seen your work?
I work at Composure.
Fastest- growing women' s fashion magazine in the country.
I' m impressed.
Saving the world, one shop- a- holic at a time, eh?
Look here, Sparky,
I have a Master' s in journalism from Columbia.
I can write about anything I want.
Like shoes?
No.
No.
Like alcoholic beverages and athletic gear.
Touché.
Very nice.
So, you think you got me all figured out, eh?
Almost.
Still got one last question.
Shoot.
True or false:
all' s fair in love and war.
True.
Great answer.
Good question.
Welcome.
Oh, nice place.
Thank you.
Very... tidy.
Can I get you a cold beer?
Sure.
Can I use your restroom?
Yeah, you can.
It' s up the stairs, through the bedroom.
You are, aren' t you?
The first night.
I can' t believe you!
Michelle, I' m not going to sleep with him.
Oh, you are such a hussy.
You can' t hide those lying eyes.
No, no, because I can practice some self- control, unlike some people I know.
Oh, really?
That hurts, kind of.
I' m going to dangle the bait...
Wait, what' s the bait?
I' m the bait, Michelle.
- Yeah.
Okay, I' m with you.
Then what?
Diamond...
A diamond is a long- term commitment.
Take notes.
You better be prepared...
I can' t talk right now.
I have to go.
Okay.
Bye.
- Thank you.
You' re welcome.... so brand- new
Let me be the one you come...
Hey, hey, let' s not go too fast, okay?
We' re moving too fast.
I... you' re right.
It' s- it' s too fast.... and break up
- Oh, turn around and make up
- Too fast.
- Too fast.
Yeah.
I want you to respect me.
I do.
Okay.
And I want your respect.
I respect you for respecting me.
I respect that.
Good.
Good night, Andie Anderson.
Oh, you are already falling in love with me.
I' m going to make you wish you were dead.
Poor guy.
Of all the women Spears and Green could have thrown at me, this one is amazing.
Hanging with her for ten days is going to be no problem.
Right, so, it' s only nine days longer than you' ve ever spent with any other chick, huh?
That' s why I didn' t go for the gold immediately.
Oh.
I' m taking my time.
It' s a marathon, not a sprint.
Ten days is a marathon?
Okay, so it' s more like the 3, 000- meter hurdle.
The point is, she' s already on the ropes, guys.
Wow, that- that' s a lot of sports analogies.
That it?
- That- that' s it?
- That' s it.
Have you looked inside?
No.
Do you have an ethical problem with rifling through a woman' s purse?
Uh, yeah, I guess I do.
Well, it' s hardly a purse, dude.
It' s more like a clutch or something.
All right?
There- there are many dark and dangerous things in there that we, the male species, should know nothing about.
Unless, of course, she, uh, left it behind intentionally to secure a next- day call back.
Mm- hmm.
She' s a very clever minx.
Oh, God.
Oh, shit, we got to clean that up.
Yeah, yeah.
Carefully.
Oh, what have we here?
Let us see, let us see.
Knicks tickets...
Huh.... for tonight' s game.
Delivery, Andie.
Wow, look at those!
Oh, who are those for?
Andie, oh, my God!
Where do you want these?
Who are these to?
Wait.
... more beautiful... "
Wait. "... than 100 roses."
Catchy.
The guy' s in advertising.
He can' t help it.
So, does this mean he' s hooked?
This means he found the Knicks tickets.
You left the tickets in the purse?
Yeah.
You are just on a whole different playing field.
Here you go.
Andie Anderson.
Hey, hey, pretty girl.
Guess what?
I got a really embarrassing display of white roses.
Well, you are welcome.
Listen, I had a wonderful time last night.
I have your bag.
Ah, I know.
I can' t believe I left it there.
Yeah, well, you must need it back, what with all the cash, credit cards, and... those Knicks tickets for tonight' s game.
Sounds like you' ve been peeking through my bag, Ben.
Oh, absolutely not.
Tony, my Art Director, he' s an oaf, and he accidentally knocked it over.
Ow, right!
Yeah, I' m a clumsy man.
All right, I' m sorry, though.
I' m going to the game with somebody else.
Not anymore.
Besides, what?
You think you left your purse at my place by accident?
Subconsciously, you are dying to take me to that game.
Denying your subconscious desires is extremely dangerous to your health, young lady.
Does that psycho- babble really work on anybody?
You tell me.
Andie, you' re so bad.
All right, meet me at the 7th Avenue entrance.
7: 30.
Don' t be late.
You got it.
Bye- bye.
Bye.
And that' s how it' s done.
Foul on Number 20, Allan Houston.
Bullshit.
Come on, ref!
What is that, ref?
Hey, if you' re going to call it, call it both ways!
Oh, you' re soft, man!
You were soft last year, and you' re still soft.
What was that?
There we go.
All right.
Come on, bud.
Defense!
That' s off!
Defense!
20 second time out.
Take a minute...
This is all right.
Got 20 seconds.
20 second team.
Knicks' ball.
- Bring it back.
Charge!
Work your arm, baby.
Go, baby.
Hold 'em up!
Charge!
Benny?
Hold 'em up!
Work it, work it.
Benny, I' m kind of thirsty.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
- Yeah, yeah!
- Benny, could you get me a soda?
Yeah, just let me tell you right now...
I' m parched.... there' s a minute and nine left in the game,
- and then I' il go up and get it.
- I' m really thirsty.
I' il go get it.
Hey, hey, hey.
You want... you want it right now?
Yeah.
And no ice, Ben.
Thanks, Benny.
Lawrence Funderburke.
Oh, man!
Here' s Sprewell with a fake.
Gets the step on Christie.
What a crossover...
Coke, no ice.
Next line over, pal.
No ice.
Hey, buddy?
Small coke, no ice.
Okay, you got it.... beyond the three- point line, fires!
Ah... no!
Man, don' t let him have that shot!
Does that mean no, you don' t want ice, or no, you want ice?
No.
Coke, no ice.
And Don Chaney wants to talk it over...
Oh, did you want a small?
No, l- I want that one right there.
You know, for 25 cents more, you could get a jumbo?
Okay, you take that right there.
Keep the change.
All right.
Charge!
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Score!
Come on, baby, drive into the net!
Right there, right there.
Oh, thanks!
Hey, hold him, hold him.
Move it.
Set your pick!
Watch the three seconds!
Traveling!
Ben, it' s not diet.
- Huh?
- Ben, it' s not diet.
Please, I' m so thirsty.
- All right, all right.
- With a lime.
- All right, okay, I got it.
- With a lime.
Shoot it!
Sprewell for the win!
Yes!
That was Sprewell!
It' s all over!
The Knicks have defeated the Kings in the final seconds...... Sprewell with the game- winning shot, and the Knicks over Sacramento:
Oh, what an incredible game.
I' ve never seen a more exciting game- ending play before.
Wow, well, neither have l.
Hey, hey, hey.
It' s too bad you missed it.
Yep, it' s too bad.
One second.
So... you as nice as you seem, Ben?
No.
Good.
Neither am l.
Oh, here.
Fifth and 12th, please.
See you later.
Horseshit.
More horseshit.
The horseshit continues.
Horseshit.
Come on, people.
We' ve got to do a lot better than this if we' re going to com...
What?!
There' s a phone call for Mr. Barry.
Yeah, can you take a message, Candi?
Uh, Mr. Barry, it' s Andie.
- Make it quick.
- I will.
It' s line two, Mr. Barry.
Thank you.
Hello.
It' s me!
Listen, I' m in the middle of a meeting.
Can I call you back in just a minute?
I miss you,
Benny boo- boo, boo- boo- boo.
Well, you know what?
I miss you, too.
You busy tonight?
No, I' m not.
Why don' t we catch a movie or somethin '?
A movie -- my choice?!
Your choice.
Oh, I' m so excited!
I' il call you later.
Bye- bye.
Bye.
Jonah!
Dad!
I always wanted a man like Tom Hanks.
It' s my favorite movie of all time.
Yeah, me, too.
What are you thinking about?
I' m watching the movie.
Yeah, but what' s on your mind?
I like this movie.
Oh, so I suppose your mind is a complete blank.
Who is she?
Who' s who?
The girl you' re thinking about.
Can' t hear.
- I' m not thinking about a girl.
- for two hours - Shh! and not be thinking about another girl.
You want to know what I' m thinking about?
Yes.
I' m sitting here thinking about how damn beautiful you are.
That' s what I' m thinking about.
Come on, let' s watch this movie, it' s good.
Benji.
Oh, sweetie!
I love sharing this with you.
Yeah.
Can' t hear and can' t see.
lf you don' t shut up, my boyfriend over here is going to come back there and pummel your ass.
Put a muzzle on your old lady the next time you bring her out in public.
What?!
What is that?!
Do something about...
- You, outside.
Keep it down!
I mean, have a little class, all right?
You want to talk like that to me, we can work it out, but not to a lady, all right?
Ben, Ben, B- B- Ben, he' s huge.
I got it.
I' m not looking to get in a fight with the guy, okay?
He owes you an apology.
Now, I' m going to go back inside, and finish watching Sleepless in Seattle.
Nobody screw with me.
Son of a... bitch.
- Aah!
- Oh...
- Ben,
Maybe we should get you to a hospital.
No, no, no, no.
No, you could have a...
Excuse me!
Uh- uh- uh, hey, hey, can you hold still, right there, hold still?
Okay, I' m sor...
That' s feeling real nice.
Ben...
Ben...
I' m starting to feel a little better.
Ben...
Ben!
Oh, my God!
You' re fine.
Oh, you are totally fine.
Okay, come on, Rocky.
No, no...
Get up.
Ouch.
Huh?
Yeah.
Hey, don' t feel bad.
I got in a fist fight during a chick flick, whoo!
Uh- huh, right.
It really wasn' t that bad.
Really?
I mean, the getting punched in the face part sucked, right?
Well...
But the getting taken care of after the punch -- it was nice.
All right!
Florence Nightingale syndrome, yeah.
You want me to tape the game for you tonight?
No need, my friend.
I' il be watching the Knicks from the comfort of my own home this evening.
- How' d you swing that?
- Oh, yeah.
What' s good to grill?
- Heavyweight.
You' re making the lamb.
Voila.
A woman loves a man who can cook, yeah?
Bringing out the big guns.
- Let' s go deep.
- I like it.
Why do they always forget my bacon?
I can' t believe you got that guy knocked out.
Only for a few seconds.
Mm- hmm.
Are you dating him, or are you contemplating adoption?
Andie, I am loving your notes on this piece.
Thank you, Lana.
When are you seeing him again?
Tonight.
He' s invited me over for dinner.
I' ve got a feeling about this one.
Thanks, Lana.
I hate it when she pops her head in like that.
I never noticed it.
I heard that.
And Andie, tonight, take smaller bites.
Oh, my God!
Disgusting.
I can barely eat over here.
Door' s open.
- Hi.
- Hey, there.
I hope you brought your appetite, girl.
We got a feast tonight.
You know you could' ve been some bird food Benny, isn' t that sweet?
Go on and pour yourself a glass of wine.
We got diner in about five and tip- off in about eight.
I' m starving.
So perfectly pink!
Pour Ia piece de résistance.
Sheryl, Tori,
Sinead, Jewel, Fiona, Carly -- gang' s all here!
Great.
Got two minutes to game time.
Like you were walking onto a yacht
You had strategically dipped below one eye
Your scarf -- it was apricot
Look at all this stuff.

- As you watched - I saw the...
- Yourself gavotte - the new comforter.
They' d be Ben' s partner, they' d be Ben' s partner
And you' re so vain What you got in the box?
It' s a baby fern.
Really?
Oh, yeah?
Just like our relationship.
A helpless little baby in need of tender loving care.
Thank you.
- Turn it down.
Okay, let' s check out the starting line
- At the point, Latrell Sprewell - Get ready.
Game two.
Welcome to the front row, madam.
Dinner is served.
Chef' s special tonight.
Lamb with a cherry glaze.
A few carrots.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey.
You okay?
It' s beautiful.
Thanks.
You' re beautiful.
The game, the whole thing.
I wish I ate meat.
Little lamb...
You have to take it away before I gag.
This stuff' s for cows.
- Hi.
How you doing?
Oh, aw, it' s just a little indigestion.
- You okay?
- Mm- hmm.
All right.
Uh, excuse me, m' am?
Do you happen to know the score of the Knicks game?
Do I look like the kind of person who knows the score of a Knicks game?
No, you don' t.
ls something wrong with the barley?
No, no.
My boyfriend thinks I' m fat!
And I can' t eat in front of him!
I can' t eat in front of you!
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- I don' t think you' re...
I don' t think you' re fat.
I don' t think she' s fat.
What' s happening?
Spre just turned up; 23 seconds left.
Knicks' ball.
Get the ball, man.
Oh, come on!
Throw it!
That was in!
- Oh, man!
Come on, get it back.
Come on.
Get the ball back, get the ball back!
Jackson takes the ball.
A spin by Jackson.
- Get it back!
Damn!
And the time has run out.
- Pick up!
The Kings have beaten the Knicks.
Their first win in the series.
Next game.
Well, that was fun.
Okay.
1 1: 25.
Sports.
Ah, there we are.
Then it' s Mark Jackson with a no- look pass to Kirk Thomas...
Sorry we missed the game.
Reverse it!
30 seconds left in the game, Sprewell...
There we go, baby!
Oh, I can' t believe he missed that shot.
Take it, take it!
- 12 seconds left, the game...
- Pitch!
How the hell did you know he was going to miss that shot?... with a narrow Monroe move.
- from the top of the key.... as the Knicks could not get off another shot.
Aah, man.
Houston never misses from the top of the key.
Does Princess Sophia want to come out and play?
Who' s Princess Sophia?
- No, no, no, no... no!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, y- you' re kidding me, right?
Princess Sophia?
Little, big, little, big, I don' t know.
We will find out!
Ah, you know, hang on a second.
Ah, no, no.
All right, listen.
Princess Sophia.
It doesn' t...
Yes, I can.
L- L- Listen to me.
lf- lf you' re going to name... my member, all right, you got to name it something hyper- masculine, okay?
Something like Spike or Butch, or Krull, the Warrior King, but not Princess Sophia.
What did you just say?
Spike.
You know what I mean?
No, no, after Spike.
Butch.
After Butch.
Krull...
Krull, the Warrior King.
Does Kr- rull, the Warrior King want to come out and play?
- Oh, come on...
... Krull.
You know what?
Due to... intense humiliation, the King has... momentarily abdicated his throne.
- Oh, uh- oh!
Yeah.
I' d better get going.
Take care of our love fern, honey.
Mm.
Can I see you tomorrow?
Really?
I hope so.
Call me.
I will.
And I' il call you.
Sweet dreams.
Answer your phone!
What?
What was "icy" again?
"Arctic, freezing, frigid."
How about "glitter"?
Thayer' s favorite movie.
It was underrated.
"Glint, glisten, scintillation."
"Scintillation --" that' s not bad.
Aw, that sucks.
Guys, let' s take a break.
A little coffee and nine- ball.
Shake it out.
Maybe I' il be able to concentrate since the woman is driving me crazy.
Which woman -- Andie, or Princess Sophia?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Wait a second.
I thought you said after the Knicks game that she was a goddess.
Oh, she was.
That was the good Andie, guys.
This amazing, fun, cool, sexy woman.
I' m talking about the evil Andie, now.
It' s like a... it' s like a crack- enhanced Kathie Lee Gifford.
She... she' s probably bipolar.
Well, her South Pole' s definitely prevailing.
Well, all you gotta do is rock it for five more days.
Muffin!
Which shouldn' t be too difficult.
- Hi!
- Andie!
- My little muffin.
- Hey, sweetie.
We were just talking about you.
- Hi.
- Hello, there.
How are you?
You look gorgeous.
Oh, thank you.
Andie, this is Tony, and this is Thayer.
- Oh, yes.
Benny Wenny' s told me so much about you two.
Oh, well, Benny Wenny' s said wonderful things about you, too.
Oh, they don' t look so simple- minded.
Honey,
I got for us.
Look at that.
- Look at him go.
What is it?
Jumper.
It' s a Chinese Crested, of course.
No kidding.
- A Chinese Crested.
So, it- it' s like a dog, right?
Oh, hey.
There he is.
Ooh, Ben.
Ben.
You' re hurting Krull' s feelings.
Krull, is it?
Krull.
Krull, the Warrior King.
Well, sure, 'cause that' s clearly what...
Oh, wait, there' s more.
What do you got there?
Oh, nice.
- For me?
- Get out of town.
- Try it on.
That' s like the... inside of a raincoat.
Oh, yeah.
- It matches!
Now, that is going to fit nicely, sweetie, thank you.
No, Ben, put it on.
No, you should try it on.
Otherwise, you don' t know if it' s going to fit or...
Oh, go for it.
That has never hurt anybody.
I was just gonna save it for a better occasion, all right?
Check that out.
Oh, yeah, that' s nice.
- Hmm?
You' re a vision in khaki.
Just the three of us.
We are, aren' t we?
He' s our boy, Ben.
Oh, see, that' s sweet.
Andie, hey, it' s good to see you, too, sweetie.
Ah, I got you.
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.
He' s just not potty- trained yet.
Okay, well, he' s a pisser.
Come here, little tinkle king.
No, no, no.
Come here, tinkle king.
- He is a tinkle king.
You tinkle tinkles.
little plaid family.
We, you know, we got a whole bunch of work we got to do, but we' re... we' re still on for poker at your house this weekend?
- Oh, you count on it.
- Whoo!
- Yeah.
Yeah, it was nice meeting you,
Nice to meet you.
And, of course, Krull.
Say bye, Krullie.
A little soap and water will take that out.
He goes, "Woof, woof."
Yeah, thank you, buds.
Oh, come here.
Do you love him?
Oh, I do.
Oh, look at Krull' s necklace.
He' s got more ice than Liberace, don' t you?
Oh, it' s just a little frosting.
Frosting?
Frosting.
We were thinking bold, new, fresh.
"Frost yourself."
Excuse me?
"Frost yourself --"
The slogan for the campaign.
You frost a cake.
We' re in the middle of a meeting, Benjamin.
I' m talking about diamonds.
They' re frosting.
As in, "Whoa, would you check out her frosting?"
- Frost yourself.
- Frost yourself.
How did you come up with it?
I got it off the woman who is falling madly in love with me.
I will decide that at the party.
lf he can get her there.
Now, just think about it -- ladies, frost yourself.
Frost yourself.
We could introduce it at the party.
lt- It should be the theme.
Everything frosted.
- All of it.
- Martini glasses.
Chandeliers.
Ah, jewels everywhere.
The women.
The whole party -- a sparkling diamond.
All of it frosted.
Women of New York!
Frost yourselves!
Hey, frost this!
Well, I like it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I hear you.

Ow!
Tried to get ahold of you.
Yeah?
I did something kind of wacky.
Eh?
Yes.
I used Photoshop at work today to composite our faces together to see what our kids would look like.
Family...
You don' t want to see our children?
We don' t have... children.
I hate you.
You know what?
I' m sorry.
No, no, no.
I didn' t mean it like that, all right?
I...
Show me, show me, show me, show me.
Please show me.
We don' t have children!
Oh, I thought you meant...
I just want to...
Will you show them to me?
You don' t want to see them.
I do.
Please, please show them to me.
I really do want to see them.
Really?
Yeah.
Okay.
Oh, that' s our wedding.
Benny, Jr.
Yeah.
Oh, there' s us vacationing in Hawaii.
Benjamin, Jr. on yours.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
There' s little Andie.
Oh, there are the kids in Switzerland, yodel- odel- ing.
Our kids are really... attractive.
Yeah!
Ah, hey, Mom.
Ah, yeah, I' m- I' m doing fine.
Yeah, yeah, she is.
Just a second.
It' s for you.
Oh, great.
Hey, Glenda.
Why is my mom calling you?
I just showed him.
Yeah, well, he thinks our children will be very attractive.
Oh, no.
All right, you go back to cooking.
Call me later.
Tomorrow.
Yeah, great.
Okay, Glenda.
Love you, too.
Thanks, honey.
Yeah.
So you and my mom, you talk, huh?
Yeah, I called her to get some baby pictures of you for our book.
Hey, you never told me... that you wore diapers till you were five.
You know what, honey, I got to go to the...
Ah, no, come on, man.
You think maybe he thinks the felt is grass?
No, no,
Come on!
Hey, Benny Bear?
Hey!
Do you have plans tonight?
Tonight?
I have another surprise for you.
Ah... you know what?
Not a good night for me.
l- I, l gotta work.
- Of all things.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
We got a Knicks game on.
'cause I got to go in to work.
That' s too bad, 'cause I had tickets for tonight.
Tickets?
[Rock]
Good morning, Tom.
Twelve is our number.
It' s the number of games my husband Tom coaches at Lincoln College every season.
It' s the number of times we zero out our bank account each year to make ends meet.
And it' s the number ofkids we try to keep track of.
- [Sighs]
Good run?
[Groans]
You need a paramedic?
No, just a pair of knees.
You finish?
Still proofing, but I' m sending it to Diane today.
Look at this.
New, clean cover... no peanut butter stains... yet.
- Hey, baby?
- Baby?
You know, on the run, you know what I was thinking?
What?
Well, we' ve been married, what, five years?
Twenty- three.
Sorry.
like- like this lumpy old mattress.
- [Giggling]
Don' t be ridiculous, honey.
You know you can just pound the lumps out of a mattress.
What- What do you mean?
You can just pound the lumps out of a mattress?
Yeah, just randomly start swatting away.
- And it goes flat?
- Yes, yes.
Just start -- You just randomly start swatting --
Careful.
- [Woman Narrating]
Twelve' s an insane number ofkids... but having a small family was never an option for us.
See, Tom loved growing up with seven brothers and sisters.
And after my sister died, I spent most of my time... wishing I had seven brothers and sisters.
Tom and I met at Illinois Polytechnic University.
He was a senior dreaming ofbecoming the head football coach there.
I was a freshman dreaming ofbecoming a sports reporter.
Bam.
An hour after I met him, I knew he was the one.
Wejust had family at the wedding.
Oh, and Shake Maguire, Tom' s best man.
What a hot dog.
Ayear later, we had our first -- Nora.
I loved taking her to work with me.
- [Baby Crying]
As much as we wanted our big careers, we wanted our big family more.
I quit writing for the Tribune, and we moved to the country.
Tom and I got busy when we moved to Midland.
We had Henry, Sarah, Jake and Mark in consecutive years.
Then we went for magic number eight, and instead... we got the first set of fraternal twins -- Jessica and Kim.
- Nine kids.
Come on.
Hi!
With each child, Tom and I got further from our big career dreams.
But we didn' t think about that.
Sorry, Coach.
We had our hands full with nine.
We were happy, and we were done.
Then we went to a party celebrating Shake Maguire' s appointment... to athletic director at our alma mater.
And, well, too many beers and nine months later, we had Mike.
After that, Tom got a vasectomy.
But he didn' t hear the doctor say that it would be a few weeks... before the procedure became effective.
In '98, Nigel and Kyle got us to that crazy number 1 2.
But by then, Tom and I were experts at managing chaos.
- Let' s move, gang.
Come on, come on, come on!
- Charlie missed his curfew again last night.
Take care of that.
You can only put on so much lip gloss, princess!
You blew my concentration!
Temper, Sarah.
Now I get to start all over again.
- [Lorraine]
Okay, Daddy.!
- Have you seen my frog, Dad?
Sorry, Charlie.
Uh, Nigel.
Kyle.
- It' s Mark.
- I knew that.
Hey, teenager.
You got caught on Mom radar last night.
You' re not gonna get that scholarship if you' re out late with Beth... the night before a big game.
Well, I' m not so sure I even want to go to college.
Since when?
Since Beth' s mom offered me a job at the auto shop.
Sounds exciting.
Well, we' il talk about that after you get your full ride.
And, meanwhile, in by 1 0: 00 on school nights.
Clear?
- Got it.
- Anything else you wanna talk about?
Did I mention I don' t like you very much?
- Yeah, you mentioned that.
- Then I' m good.
- [Chuckles]
Dude, two words: need new skates.
Dude, three words: paper route.
"Hi.
Can' t make dinner.
Hank and I are moving into our new apartment.
Love, Nora. "
- Mm- mm.
Here you go, Gunner.
You hungry, boy?
Here you go, Gunner.
Are you hungry?
Look, I am totally aware that this family doesn' t value... self- presentation in the same obsessive way that I do.
Fine.
Whatever.
But one of my life goals... aside from being, like, a fashion guru... is to indicate to the local community that... the Baker family actually owns a bar of soap.
I think I should be allotted at least five extra minutes in front of the mirror.
- Three.
- Done.
Now help your sister butter the toast.
Sarah, your suspension from lacrosse for excessive force has been lifted.
So you' re going today.
Henry, you have band practice, all right?
I cleaned your clarinet.
Please don' t play with food in your mouth again.
Kim and Jessica, your teacher called and has made a request... that you do not correct her in front of the class.
Mike, you have show- and- tell today.
And, please, honey... remember that body parts do not count.
Kyle and Nigel, you have a dentist' s appointment at 3: 00.
You' re goin 'to work with Dad.
Yeah!
- [Sighs]
- What time' s Nora coming over?
- Uh, she may not make it.
She hardly ever comes home since she started dating that doorknob.
- He' s not a doorknob.
- The man irons his jeans, Mom.
- [Tom]
Never mind.
I' il shoot it without her.
I' il Photoshop her in.
Honey, could you take 1 0 pounds off me with that Photoshop thing?
- Wait.
If Sarah' s bein 'Photoshopped in...
- Why don' t we all be --
Nobody gets Photoshopped in but Nora.
Everybody be here by 4: 00.
Why do we always do our Christmas cards in May anyway?
Because the earlier we get it done, the bigger discount we get at the printer.
- [All Chattering]
Here you go.
Look alive.
No, Mark!
Get him!
Get him, Charlie.!
- He' s headed for the waffles.!
- I got him, Charlie.!
I got him.!
- Come to Daddy.!
Come on.!
Mike, stick!
- Mark, net!
- I got the door covered!
[Yells]
Busted.
Put Beans in his cage... now.
Is everything broken?
Teacup with the flower on it broken?
Nice move, FedEx.
Okay, here we go, everyone.
School.
Let' s go.
Hey.
Much cooler.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Henry, here you go.
- Thanks, Mom.
For the record, I am so over Nora' s hand- me- downs.
All right, well, you look gorgeous in anything, Lorraine.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What' s wrong with you, mister?
'cause I don' t fit in with this family.
You fit.
You fit right here.
- Like that.
I called shotgun.!
- No, I did!
- I did!
- [Kate]
All right, that' s it.!
Hey, you two, knock it off!.
Mom' s losing it!
I' m losing it!
All right.
Come on.
Break it up.
Break it up.
Are you okay?
I' il give you candy.
- Nigel, Kyle, chill or be chilled.
- Sure.
Listen to him.
Oh.
- [Groans]
Well, not exactly.
Here.
That is so Nora.
We tell 'em they can' t sleep together... when they visit, so she moves in with him.
Honey, she' s just trying to have her own life.
- She' s too young to have her own life.
- She' s 22.
The same age I was when I was pregnant with her.
Five minutes ago, she was sitting on my shoulders... pointing at cows in Munger' s Field.
- And then you blinked.
- Yeah.
- Enough with the blinking.
No more blinking.
- All right.
You were checking me out, weren' t you?
Yes, I was.
You got a problem with that?
Twelve kids later, and we still got the heat.
[Nigel, Kyle Together]
Hit it.!
Faster, faster, faster.!
- Is that as fast as you can go?
- Is that all you got?
Pump 'em high!
Pump 'em high!
Let' s go!
- That' s good!
That' s good!
That' s what I' m talkin 'about.
Way to go, Marcus.
Way to go, boys.!
Nice passes.
- Right here.
- Nice job!
Man, you' re gettin 'old and ugly.
Shake.
Hey.
Hey, what are you doin 'here?
What, are you still too busy bein 'the pansy house- husband to read the newspapers?
That coach was 5- 3.
That' s doesn' t cut it.
I' m trying to grow a program.
Hey, guys.
Remember Shake?
We played college ball together.
Yeah, the hot dog.
Mom said it first.
We' re having adult time here, boys.
No idea what that means.
Well, it' s this crazy thing where grown- ups... actually get to have a conversation without being interrupted by kids.
- Sounds wicked boring.
It is.
So why don' t you run along?
Mom' s right.
He is a wiener.
Sorry about that.
Kate likes you.
It' s just that, you know... she had to have the biggest stud on the team.
So she, uh, chose the third- string receiver... and got all this.
So, are you gonna tell me why you' re here?
Lincoln' s a winning machine.
You think you can make our old team a champion again?
- You mean coach?
- Coach.
- Tom, what is it?
Just tell me.
- Just -- - Okay.
Wait.
- Dad' s covering with the machines.
- To the chute!
- Go, go, go!
My, this is big.
Shake Maguire wants me to coach the Stallions.
- Get out!
- He offered me... a fat five- year contract, housing allowance, moving expenses.
Kate, we can finally get new furniture.
We can get a new car.
And get this.
University employees can send their kids to school for free.
I don' t know, honey.
A Division I coaching job... that' s a lot of pressure and a lot more hours.
Yeah, but with all the kids in school next year, we could handle more job pressure.
Yeah, but, honey, Midland is our home.
I mean, the kids' lives are here.
Midland has been great for raising our kids... but I never expected 'em to sacrifice the way that I did.
You loved your childhood.
Yeah.
Except for this part -- the raggedy, hand- me- down part.
The Stallions head coach.
It' s your dream job, isn' t it, honey?
I want this one, Kate.
Let' s talk to the kids.
How do you think they' il handle it?
- We' re gonna move!
Okay, everybody, you know the drill.
On "three," you give me a big "cheese."
Jake, do you have to wear black?
Black works, Mom. Jesus, like, has his funeral on Christmas.
- He died on Easter, Barbie.
- Whatever.
He was resurrected on Easter, moron.
- Be quiet.
- Don' t touch me.!
What' s all the fighting about?
Exactly when did you plan on telling us about moving?
- I' m not moving!
- Yeah, because I' m not moving, all right?
- I' m not moving.
- Charlie, Evanston is only four hours away.
- Beth can come and visit.
- This isn' t just about Beth, Mom.
- [Telephone Ringing]
- Hello?
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, Nora.
You' re on speaker.
- Hi, everybody.
Hank says hi too.
So, you guys are thinking about moving up here?
Yeah.
You got room in that new apartment for your big old family?
Just big enough for two, Dad.
How' s your book going, Mom?
Actually, I just sent it to a friend who' s in publishing, so we' il see.
- Could we stay on subject, please?
- Beans' s mother' s buried here.
I' m not splitting them up.
They' re family.
We can build a fancy new memorial to Pork in our new yard.
- Yeah, like we could afford that.
- Actually, we can.
I' il be making enough money to do that, get you out of hand- me- downs... getJake those new skates, and get that new car we' ve been saving for.
- But I have friends here!
- Honey, you' il keep in touch.
And you can make new friends.
Quiet!
Now, look, I know you' re all scared.
Moving is a big deal.
We' re very comfortable here.
I get that.
And that' s why I turned down a lot of other coaching offers through the years.
But this is a job I wanted since we left Chicago.
And, in fact, it' s more than a job to me.
Um, this is my team... and it' s my colors and it' s, um... the Stallions.
And they' re finally calling my number.
And I want you to take this risk with me, because if you do...
I promise you, we will be... a happier and stronger family.
- You promise?
- I promise.
- Yeah, definitely.
We should vote.
That' s the only way to make it fair.
It' s the only way to do it.
All right, we can vote.
But in the end, your mother and I are gonna do what we think is best for the family.
- What' s the point of even voting?
- I' m out.
- Let' s get out of here.
It' s not even worth it.
- Come on, guys.
[Nora On Speakerphone]
Still here.
All right, eight noes... three yes' s and three maybes.
Not exactly a mandate.
Give me a pen.
I' m gonna change some of these.
Here we go.
- What?
- "What"?
Let' s review, shall we?
"I' m so glad I found someone whose dreams are as big as mine.
I love you.
Kate. "
I always loved the way you go for things, Tom.
Pedal to the metal, full- on, all of it or none of it.
So we' re doing this.
We' re gonna do this.
We' re doing it.
And by the time we move, the kids' il get used to the idea.
Say good- bye to your mother, Beans.
Gunner, to the car.!
- Come on!
I' m you.
Gunner, to the car!
- I' m Gunner.
- [Whimpers]
Hey, Charlie.
Do me a favor and drive the Cutlass?
Thanks for ruining my life.
I don' t wanna move.!
- You know what?
- [Both Yelling]
We' re taking all your toys.
Okay.
Well, whoever said expressing emotion is a good thing, I' d like to see.
Hey, this is our street.
Are you sure we' re gonna fit in here, Dad?
You' il have friends here in no time, guys.
Here we are.
We are here.
Everybody out.
I want everybody out.
- Hey, slow down there, Gunner!
- Wait up!
- Hey, Kyle, check this place out!
- [Chattering Continues]
[Tom]
There it is -- a 1 920s classic.
What, did the Munsters give you a good price?
All right, the twins share, but everybody else gets their own room.
- Now, go kill each other for the best one!
- That' s great.
Hey, Charlie.
You' re gonna need a car to visit Beth.
The Olds is yours now.
You trying to bribe me?
Is it working?
Little bit.
Welcome home, Kate.
- Mmm.
Jessica, come here.!
Check this out.!
This room is huge.!
- Can I see this one?
Back it up, FedEx.
If anyone gets the room across from me, it' s Charlie.
- And are you Charlie?
No.
Dude, I call this room.
- [Jessica]
Look at the view from here.!
- It' s spectacular.!
Can I share with you?
Oh, God.
They' re fast- food people.
People are here!
- Hi.
- Hi.
I' m Tina Shenk.
This is my husband Bill and our son Dylan.
- How do you do?
- We, uh, live across the street.
- Thank you.
This is lovely.
I' m Kate.
This is Tom.
- Hi.
- Oh!
- Gunner!
Gunner!
- I am so sorry.
- Sorry.
- Are you hiding a cheeseburger anywhere on your person?
- [Gunner Growling]
- Jake?
- Dude!
Two words: manners.
- What' s up?
Wanna help me unpack?
- Sure.
- Put your sweater on, sweetie.
- He' s inside, dear.
Don' t start, okay?
So, uh, is Jake your only child?
No.
We have 1 2.
I couldn' t keep her off me.
- Oh!
- Little less wrist, Mike.
- Got it.
- Game on.!
- Uh, they' re playing hockey in the house?
Well, if the game gets bigger than three- on- three, then they have to take it outside.
Uh, Dylan doesn' t really care for rough play.
Uh, you' re gonna wanna stop now, dude.
Oh, my God!
- Hang on, buddy!
- A little help here!
- I got him!
- Save my baby!
Don' t worry, Dylan.
I swing from the chandelier all the time.
- All right.
I got him!
I don' t got him!
- [Yelling]
So, Dylan, know any good restaurants?
I' ve got you, Dylan.!
Don' t worry, honey.!
Whoa.!
I think she' s got you.
- Spin him this way so I can -- - [Tina]
Oh, my God.!
- Oh, sweetie, are you all right?
- I' m fine, Mom.
I really hated that chandelier.
- Here we go.
We, uh -- We better go.
It' s time for your chess lesson.
I don' t have a chess lesson, Mom.
Well, then, you need to practice for your chess lesson.
Come over anytime, dude.
Uh, we' il, uh, we' il call, schedule a play date.
No need.
Just come by anytime.
Oh, no, we' il call.
- Oh- ho.
That' il be fun.
Hey, Charlie, come on down and help me with this, okay?
[Kate]
There' s glass everywhere.
- I got it, Mom.
- Okay, well, I' il help you.
- Hey, Shake, what' s up?
- You okay?
Really?
Okay, well, I' il see you there.
Hey, guess what?
Fox Sports wants to interview me on TV!
- Okay, well, we got this.
- Dad' s gotta earn a living!
Twelve kids.
That' s the throwback.
Irresponsible is what is is.
How come we didn' t have more kids?
Because we wanted one perfect child... and that' s what we got.
Cool.
Honey, I' m gonna be home late tonight.
I got another press conference.
Whatever happened to that stud... who sat across from me at dinner every night?
He got his dream job, remember?
- Good- bye, Dad.
- See ya, buddy.
Tell the masseuse I' m running about 1 5 minutes late.
- [Henry]
Where you goin '?
To sign up for football.
And, no, you can' t come.
Could this place be any more boring?
- There' s, like, nothing to do around here.
- I could give you a makeover.
All righty, then.
I' m Charlie Baker.
Oh, yeah, Tom Baker' s boy.
Read where his old buddy Shake threw him a bone.
Offense or defense?
I' m a quarterback.
Yeah, well, maybe in Cowpie, illinois.
This is 4- A, Skippy.
The bigs.
Put him on defense.
Cornerback.
By the way, when you show up for practice, don' t be wearing that hat.
Who' s next?
Yes?
It' s been reported that you like to blast music in your locker room.
Uh, well, it loosens up the players... and, uh, gets' em psyched.
Unless, of course, I start dancing.
Then they just get nauseous.
At least we get to see him on TV.
Coach, how do you manage a family of 1 2... and a football team?
Well, I' ve got a great team here... and a solid support system at home.
- Go to bed, kids.
- Okay, you heard the coach.
- [Gunner Groaning]
In Midland, we were a family.
Now we' re a support system?
- [Groans]
Hello?
Who' s this?
- Somebody from something something.
- Okay.
Hello?
Yeah, hi, Diane.
This is business.
Salmons and pinks are so homemaker.
All right, focus on your navies and your grays.
Navy is muscle, gray is smarts.
Choose either, and you' il rule the boardroom.
- What' s going on?
- Guess what?
Diane Phillips called.
My book' s getting published.
Did I tell you we' re gonna have it all?
- You' ve never said that.
Whoo!
Oh, my God!
Can you guys just please wait till I leave the room?
Can you hurry?
- All right, there' s one thing.
- What?
They asked me to go to New York for a few days.
That was a good "oh," as in "okay."
Yes, it' s not the best timing in the world.
- But you' re going to New York.
I can handle this.
- You' il manage.
Yeah.
Well, you haven' t been home much, Tom, since we moved here.
Done all that.
- You' re considering this?
- I' m not considering it.
You' re going.
Nora can help me out around the house.
Wow.
Wow.
It totally sucks.
I miss you too... but, I mean, I gotta get a job.
Hi, Lorraine.
Okay, I' il try and be there, honey.
Hi, Kimmy.
Yeah, I- I know I haven' t been very friendly recently.
They are pulling me in again!
- Just tell 'em you can' t do it.
- Can you guys hold on a second?
That' s easy for you to say.
You' re an only child.
It might be fun to babysit together.
No!
Whoa, no!
You know what happened last time we visited.
- They were welcoming you into the family.
- They set me on fire!
Just your pants.
Honey, I am an actor, okay?
And, sure, last time it was just my pants.
But what if next time it' s my face?
This is the moneymaker.
I' m not that good of an actor.
This is how I get the jobs.
I know that.
I' m man enough to admit it.
- Don' t look at me like that.
Don' t look at me like that!
- Please, please, please, please?
You always do that to me.
Fine, fine.
You know what?
We' il go.
One thing happens, and I' m gone.
And no fires.
And we sleep in the same room.
Kimmy, put Dad on.
She says she' il help us out if they can stay in the same room.
No way.
No, she knows the rules.
She wants to have her own room when she' s here.
Isn' t that sweet?
No.
Okay, look, why don' t you just come over on Sunday, and we' il talk logistics.
Bye.
- Tell me Doorknob Man isn' t babysitting too.
Yes, he very well might be, young lady.
And do not set his pants on fire again.
- [Kate]
- Classic.
It was just his pants.
Is anybody besides me thinking our happier and stronger life... was actually code for "nastier and suckier"?
First, Dad forces us to move.
Then Mom decides to become a career person and, like, travel the globe.
Now we have to take orders from Hank, the model/ actor?
- Ow!
Nora' s blind to his evil.
We have no choice but to intervene.
We' ve got 48 hours.
Let' s work a plan.
All right, Appleschmear season is officially open.!
The president of the United States, Sarah Baker... will throw out the first apple.
Bring on the chin music, baby.
Let' s go.
Oh, yes.!
And now it' s sauce.
Mmm!
It' s the game my Great- Grandma Gilbreth invented.
- Neat.
Time out.
Nora' s here.
- Nora!
Nora!
- No!
No, no, no, no!
Kids, please do not touch the LeBaron. Just had it detailed.
Hey, whoa, Tom.
Tom, can we please, uh... ask the kids to respect the perimeter around the LeBaron?
Hey, hey, respect the perimeter, kids.
Respect --
Back up.
Nora.
Nora, welcome.
- Come on.
- It' s a luxury automobile, kids.
- Not your daddy' s Oldsmobile.
- This is for you.
Congratulations.
- Come on.
- I wanna hear all about it.
- It' s very fancy.
- Now, about the babysitting.
Battle stations.
Heads up, Hank!
Yo, Hank.!
Phase one complete.
Sorry about your clothes, Hank.
We' il have 'em dry in no time.
"Sorry about your clothes, Hank.
We' il have 'em dry in no time. "
What is with the staring?
Just stop looking at me.
Chopsticks.
Open meat bucket.
Begin underwear soaking.
So, um, how' s the acting career going, Hank?
If it was goin 'any better, there' d have to be two of me.
Yeah, we saw you in the commercial with the gargling -- the mouthwash ad.
I only started acting, uh, a month ago... and, uh, I' m already on TV.
It' s the real deal.
The career is white hot, Tom.
It' s on fire.
I read that most actors end up in the food service industry.
That' s not gonna happen to Hank, Kim.
Candidly, I, uh, think Nora' s right.
It' s really -- It' s gettin 'so as I can hardly go out in public anymore.
I mean, really, with -- between the autograph hounds and the paparazzis --
Autographs and everything?
I mean, just the one commercial... and you have paparazzi?
I' ve- I' ve actually -- I' ve never actually seen them... but, you know, they hide in the bush and they get their shot.
The crazy thing is that now we' re trying to sit at home like regularjoes --
Yeah, well, honey, it' s -- And we' re watching TV, right?
And, boom, comes on a commercial, and, bam, there' s me.
It' s, like, you expect to see yourself in the mirror... you know, and you expect to be lookin 'at the handsome devil... but not on -- not on the TV like it is.
It' s, like, bam.!
Bam.!
You turn the channel.
You' re tryin' to... you know, get it out, and it' s -- itjust keeps poppin' up.
It' s like I can run from me, but I can' t hide from me.
What a nightmare!
Yeah.
Nora, honey, you wanna help me in the kitchen?
Mm- hmm.
Wanna help me in the kitchen?
Get a pie, look at a picture of Grandma, say the rosary?
Here we go.
Everybody out.
- I' il be back.
Tommy.
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.
- Gunner!
- [Whining]
There you go.
You look as good as new.
Not as good as you, chief.
- Yeah, anywhere.
- How sweet.
- You know what you want?
Kate, is this -- is this orange juice freshly squeezed?
Nora and I are on a bit of an organic diet... and we' re only goin 'with the organic freshly squeezed... and it tastes a bit like Tropicana.
He' s a winner.
- Gunner, no!
Release the hound.
All right, charge!
You guys poppin 'out another one any time soon?
Just... curiosity.
- Gunner!
- Gunner!
- Gunner!
It' s Gunner.
Honey, he' s -- he' s really digging in.
Sorry, babe.
Gunner, stop!
Sit- Sit down!
- [Hank]
- Stop it, Gunner.
- Oh, my.
Well, he' s hungry.
- Stop it, Gunner.!
- [Screaming]
Get him off!.
Get him off!.
Nora!
Nora, we didn' t want you to go.
Look, let' s just get something clear.
Even though you guys live near me now, I have my own life.
It' s mine.
Not ours -- mine.
Nora.!
Would you please get in the LeBaron?
- I beg of you.!
- My loyalty is to Hank now... and that' s the way it' s gonna be.
In the living room, now!
Let' s go!
Your neighborhood canines have completely ruined the LeBaron' s paint job.
I' m sure my family will pay to repaint it.
Good, 'cause I' m sure payin' for your family.
- What' s that supposed to mean?
- I think you know what it means.
You soaked his underwear in meat.
That is so wrong.
Funny, but wrong.
Now, who was the mastermind... in the meat- soaking plot against Hank?
You were the masterminds?
Step back, please.
You have a dark gift, Sarah Baker.
But it' s going to cost everyone a month' s allowance.
- Do you wanna make it two?
I' m gonna need everyone to pull their own weight.
Now, go upstairs and go to your rooms!
Soaking his underwear in meat?
I mean, how do they come up with that?
If I could just harness that ingenuity and channel it into something constructive.
Yeah, like getting somebody to help you out while I' m gone.
I can handle it, even without the better half of the tag team.
I know, honey.
I' m just worried.
I' ve never left the kids --
- Honey, it' s three days!
- I know.
I' m just -- I' m gonna miss' em.
Okay, I froze some dinners.
And make sure they get to school on time.
It' s their first day, so you know how nervous they' re gonna be, all right?
And, kids, don' t worry.
Mom can be back from New York in two hours if something happens.
Really, it' s only one hour with the time difference.
All right, I hugged everybody.
One more hug, and you guys pass it on.
All right, thank you, sweetheart.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
Do I have everything?
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.
- Yeah, yeah.
Have a safe flight.
Got the whole neighborhood out to say good- bye, huh?
Bye, Mom!
Little vampires, my plan worked.
She' s gone.
Now I can raise you children the way I want to!
Come on.
It' s gonna be fun.
I mean, your dream has come true.
Mom' s gone.
Weak old Dad is here.
You can get away with murder.
You can do anything you want.
Dylan' s birthday party is coming up.
You can get all hopped up on ice cream and sugar and cake and go crazy.
You kids are gonna do great today, I promise.
What is that?
I guess he' s the funniest guy in the herd.
Walk much?
- Look at you, Diane.
- Look at you.
You did not have 1 2 kids.
- Yes, I did.
- Girl, I can' t even manage a boyfriend.
- Well, who can?
Look at this room!
- Oh, it' s great.
- Isn' t it great?
- Listen, we' ve got big plans for the book.
- Really?
I' m so -- - Ta- da!
Oh, come on!
Look at it!
- Isn' t it great?
- It' s fantastic.
I love it.
Look at this.
The company wants it in stores by Christmas.
- Christmas?
- Yes.
So, tomorrow... the marketing people will bring you up to speed on the book tour.
- A- A book tour?
- Yes.
We' ve got talk shows... book signings, personal appearances.
And it' s only gonna take a couple of weeks.
Couple of weeks?
I can' t be away from the kids that long.
Well, if there' s no book tour, then there' s no book.
- Two weeks?
- Kate... you' ve been the primary caregiver for, what, 22 years?
Can' t Tom handle the kids for a while?
They' re all going to end up on milk cartons.
Gil -- Gil, Decker and Rico are playing too loose at the corners.
- [Beeping]
Sarah, dishwasher!
I' il- I' il come by tomorrow after I drop the kids off at school... and we can talk out some offense variations.
All right.
I gotta go.
Dad, Nigel hit Kim with a dart, and I assume he will be punished.
Here, here.
Go stir.
You like to stir.
Here, let' s take a look at it.
Let' s take a look, see if it' s okay.
- Oh, no, I' m just kidding.
It' s actually not -- - Uh, Dad?
- Yeah?
- This goo' s on fire.
Oh, no, no.
That' s the way Daddy likes it!
Likes it hot and nice and spicy!
Here we go.
All right.
- Hey, Dad.
Can you get a Band- Aid?
- No need to say hello.
- Not one other kid in this neighborhood does chores.
Well, we' re not like any other family in the neighborhood.
So, why do we live here?
Dishwasher, now!
Jessica, can you get these plates and put 'em on the table, please?
Oh, God.
What the -- Mike' s athletic cup?
Pasta de la Crotch.
- Is that blood?
- No, it' s just a -- [Vomits]
Anybody?
[Yells]
- I' m in puke!
- Are you all right?
- Still need help cleaning up?
- No, you mopped it up enough with your back.
Oh, disgusting!
Where' s the Band- Aid?
Dad, it still hurts.
- Oh, here, let me look.
Nora, where' s that Band --
Jake put a bucket on Jessica' s head, and it' s stuck.
I came by to tell 'em I got a job today at an ad agency.
Nora -- Nora!
- Dad, a little help here.!
- [Gasping]
- [Groans]
- You are in over your head, mister!
- I' m so sorry.
I mean, I will -- I will call -- It' s just my wife is out of town.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Come here.
- Dad, can I killJake now?
- No, you finish washing the car first.
- Dad, can you get this Band- Aid on me?
- Yes, yes.
Come on.
Okay, come on.
Everything will be all right.
- [Jessica]
- Give me the Band- Aid.
- That' s the last time you put a bucket on my head.!
- [Gunner Barking]
Good.
Hey, Nigel, wanna play darts?
No!
No playing darts!
I told you that!
- Hello?
How' s it goin '?
Oh, everything' s fine.
I' m just, uh -- I' m just here.
- Yeah.
- Dad, check me out.!
- Isn' t this awesome?
- How are you?
- Good, I guess.
Sorry, Dad.!
I mean, it' s kind of weird having all this free time.
- You sure everything' s all right, honey?
- Oh, honey, everything' s fine.
- I can handle it.
All right, you know, I' m just used to tag- teaming to manage the mob.
- So I thought -- - Oh, no.
They' re like kittens.
Sorry, Dad.!
Uh, well, this might be a good time then to talk about me staying a few extra days.
- What?
A few extra days?
- Uh, 1 4, give or take.
What did I say about throwing darts?
That' s a lot of days, Kate, and a couple of key games.
All right, but I have a plan.
If we just take it one day at a time... and if you start to get overwhelmed or the kids stage a coup... you call me up, I' m home, end of trip.
Well, uh, s- s- sounds good.
- Got him in the face!
Okay, honey, thanks for doin 'this.
Give me someone.
They' re doing homework right now... and it' s that math, uh, trig -- "trigadronomy" thing that you and I just aren' t very good at.
And it' s the sweetest thing.
- [Nigel, Kyle Laughing]
And I' d just hate to break that up.
Well, give everyone my love, and you call me right after dinner, okay?
- Okay.
- Bye.
- [Glass Shattering]
- Bye.
- [Nigel]
Don' t hide in the closet.
Take it like a man.!
Two weeks' il go by in no time, guys.
Yeah, right.!
Yeah, right.
- Yeah?
- Hey.
- What' s up?
- Okay?
- Come in.
Look, your mom' s not coming home for a couple of weeks.
What?
Okay.
Up till now, I' ve been, like, mellow... about this whole having- it- all lifestyle that you and Mom are currently into...
"A," because Sarah has the drama queen role totally covered... and "B," because I' ve benefited from your salary spike... in various shallow but nonetheless pleasing ways.
But, Dad, check it out.
This afternoon, Mike was repelling from the roof...
Nigel was using Kim as a human dartboard... and you employed your son as a vomit mop.
Call me crazy, Pops, but things are getting pretty twisted around here.
I need to hire some help.
As in a babysitter?
Okay, that is so not happening.
Dad, just call Mom and tell her we need her back home.
I just can' t do that right now, not with all the work she' s done.
It just wouldn' t be fair.
Well, then why don' t you spend more time at home?
Honey, that' s just not an option right now.
I' ve got a big job, a job that I love.
I' m gonna have to call in some backup.
Hello.
Uh, my name is Tom Baker, and I' m interested in hiring a domestic helper.
Um, I have 1 2 children.
Actually, I' m serious.
- Just 1 2.
- Twelve.
There' s only two.
How many kids?
Well, uh, when you get here we can just count 'em up.
Well, there' s 1 2.
But one doesn' t live with me... and one you never see 'cause he' s so mad.
Uh, a dozen?
Just- Just- Just 1 2.
Hello.
I' il just hang up on myself.
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Mike.
- It' s Mark.
- Right.
What' s up?
I don' t get this math homework.
I' ve got a game I' m not nearly prepared for.
Could you go ask one of your sisters to help you?
Yeah.
Okay.
Forget it.
Hello.
Yeah, could you do me a favor... and send up 1 2 pillows to 504?
[Sighs]
Thank you.
That' il be good.
"Hey, kids, I had to get to work.
"Lorraine and Kim, you' re in charge of breakfast.
Henry and Jake, lunches.
Charlie, handle drop- offs. "
- [Bell Ringing]
We' re gonna be late.
[Chuckles]
You know, we had to take our little brothers to nursery school... if that' s okay with you.
What happened?
Did- Did Mommy and Daddy go back to the farm?
This whole "harass the hick" thing' s getting pretty old.
Actually, I' m just gettin 'started.
What else you got?
- Yeah.
- You don' t wanna know, man.
Charlie!
Charlie, Charlie, stop.
Stop. Just let it go, okay?
Yeah, Charlie.
- [Girl Chuckles]
- Charlie, go.
Hey, Gil, I got a real shot with this team.
They' re 2- 0.
They' re rising in the national standings... and they' re taking nothing for granted.
- Hey, Coach.
- Hey, teenager, what' s up?
- We need to talk.
- Sure.
- Look, Dad, um -- - Hey, guys, knock it off!.
All right, Coach.!
- but my new school -- - The press is waiting, Bake!
- They' re out there now?
- Yeah.
Come on.
Get dressed.
- Hey, can we do this later?
Hey, kids.
How was your day at school?
I' d say the high point was that you' re only 45 minutes late picking us up.
There was a pep rally at school today.
There were 20, 000 people in the stands, and I just couldn' t leave.
- Here.
- Hey, you did a drawing.
"My favorite place in the world --"
Is that the Midland house?
President Gerhard and I have been waiting for a half an hour.
I' m sorry.
I' m sorry.
I had to --
I know you have responsibilities at home, Bake, but this is it.
This is your shot, your moment, not theirs.
What' s the matter with you?
What are you doing?
You' ve wanted this for as long as I' ve known you.
I just don' t want to see you blow it.
I' il work something out.
It' s hard to believe someone as staggeringly beautiful as you... could deliver 1 2 children and still look as yummy as you do.
Oh, that' s so sweet.
I guess the camera can' t see my hips.
Tell us, did you have them conventionally?
Well, uh, after the sixth one, they just kind of walked out.
- Why don' t you read us a little something from your book?
Oh, I don' t know.
People can just buy it and then read it.
- Oh, come on.
- The audience wants it.
- Oh, all right.
"Some, uh, call me a mom.
"Others call me a primary caregiver.
But they both mean the same thing: chauffeur. "
You know, it sounds like you and your husband have things under control at home.
Oh, well, I' m lucky to have him.
Kids, on the carpet!
Now!
Dad!
[Gasps, Squeals]
- What' s goin 'on here?
- Where' s Charlie?
- He went to Midland for the day.
It' s a school day.
- He hates school.
- 'Course you couldn' t know that' cause you' re never home.
Well, that is about to change, Sarah Baker.
I have brought my work home with me.
Guys, meet the family.
Family, meet the team.
- 'Sup, boys?
- What' s up?
Okay, we will be in the living room.
We got a lot of work to do.
I don' t want any interruptions unless it' s an emergency.
Okay.
Now go do your homework.
Let' s go, guys.
All right, first team, line up.!
Good.
Good.
But you hit 'em too high.
You wanna hit 'em low.
Twenty- four.
Dad, come on!
Hey, how' s New York?
[Together]
Okay, I' ve gotta go now.
I love you.
Step off, missy!
You don' t talk that way unless it' s with humor!
Something tells me you had an unpleasant interaction with those boys, Mark.
They knocked my glasses off.
I heard you were dissing my family.
I don' t even know your family, loser.
- You do now.
- My latte!
Coach, give us a quote.
Violence begets violence.
All right, enough is enough.
You' re fighting at school.
Things are out of control.
As of this moment, you are all grounded.
- What' s "grounded"?
- "What' s grounded?"
I' il tell you what grounded is.
Except for attending games... you go to school; you come home from school; you do your homework; you do your chores; you go to bed; and that' s it.
- But that -- - Oh, yes, Sarah, I know.
- But that' s the way it is.
- Does this mean we can' t go to Dylan' s birthday party?
- That' s exactly what it means.
- We bought his presents already.
You are going to miss it!
Now, go to bed!
Hey, Gunner.
Wanna get up on the bed, buddy?
- [Groans]
Come on.
- Next year, let' s book the Mormon Tabernacle Choir too.
Whatever happened to pin the tail on the donkey?
And on the end around, the guard pulls.
That means you, Buttler.
I' m going to Dylan' s birthday party.
Hi -- Oh.
Brazilian mud viper.
She gets one live rat a week.
Hey, Dylan.
Wanna play catch with the football I got you?
Uh, my nanny' d have to check with my dad... who' d have to check with my mom who would say it was an inappropriate use of free time.
Sounds like a "yes" to me.
Go get it, Mike.
And, O' Neal, you gotta crack the first guy that shows outside.
[Man Shouting]
Run, Billy.!
Kids?
Get my kids.
I' il meet you at the house.
- Ready!
- [Together]
Sarah Baker, off, now!
- Don' t make me come up there!
Oh, my God!
It' s gonna blow!
It was my best birthday ever, Coach.
Your children are never playing with Dylan again!
- [Cell Phone Ringing]
- [Woman Continues Ranting]
Any idea what this could do to my program?
Don' t speak.
I don' t want the players at your house, and I don' t want your kids in the department.
- There he is.!
How will this impact Saturday' s game?
Coach, what do you have to say to reports that you' re simply spreading yourself too thin?
- Is this child care or football?
- Sarah from Evanston, you' re on with Kate Baker.
Mom, it' s Sarah.
Hi, Sarah.
Is everything okay?
- Come home immediately.
- I wanna talk to her!
- No!
- [Children Shouting]
- I wanna talk to her.!
- Guys, stop!
- [Line Beeps]
Now look what you did.
- Dad?
- Oh, Nora.
Thanks for coming.
Thank you, thank you.
- You seemed kind of desperate on the phone.
They' re... everywhere.
You guys?
[Cell Phone Ringing]
- I just talked to the kids.
Yes, I know everything.
Dylan' s in the hospital.
Charlie' s about to be expelled.
And Nora taking time off from her firstjob to babysit?
- Can we do this later, Kate?
You promised me that you would let me know if you couldn' t handle it.
I' m doing the best I can.
Please, let' s talk later.
Bye.
- What' s the matter?
- The book tour' s over for me.
[Nora]
We gotta get dinner on the table.
[Answering Machine Rewinding, Beeping]
[Kate On Machine]
Okay, I' m coming home.
Now, I know this is gonna be a big strain.
The publishing company arranged for the Oprah Winfrey Show to tape at our house tomorrow... which is, you know, great, but I' m really gonna need your help.
We' re talking Bakers full force.
Boys, you clean up the outside, 'girls, the inside.
I want everybody in fancy, nice, clean clothes.
And, Tom, if you could please supervise this one last thing, I would really appreciate it.
All right.
Bye.
- [Machine Beeps]
Sounds like somebody got his jimmy whipped.
Jimmy whipped!
Mommy!
Beans, you okay?
- Go get dressed, guys.
- [Tom On Phone]
Hello.
Yeah.
My flight was delayed.
I' m gettin 'there as soon as I can.
Sorry.
Those are for Oprah' s people!
- Is the house clean?
- We' re working on it, Kate.
- Okay.
- [Phone Beeps]
Okay, guys, good job!
Go inside and get cleaned up.
Come on!
Hustle up!
Hustle up!
Camera truck' s here.!
I need warm water!
Look out, Dad!
Don' t make a mess in the kitchen!
Uh, Baker house?
You guys from Oprah?
- Yes, sir.
- She' s really gonna be here?
Okay, well, just, you know, set up anywhere.
- Will do.
- Let' s go, guys.
Let' s set up over here, guys.
- [Charlie]
- You got kicked off the team.
Well, look who decided to be a parent!
Let' s check that attitude, Charlie.
I don' t fit in this town, Dad.
I' m going back to Midland.
You are not dropping out of school, and you are not walking out on this family.
What family?
Since we moved here, everybody' s been looking out for number one, especially you and Mom.
Your mother and I are doing what we think is best for everyone.
You did not take this coaching job for us.
You took this because you were a loser in college while Shake was being a superstar.
If you want your shot at glory, if you wanna have it all, you do what you gotta do.
But quit feeding us this line about being a happier and stronger family.
This move was about you!
And you know what?
I don' t have to sit here and pay the price for your life choices.
You' re staying.
Are you gonna make me?
Charlie, I love you.
I want you to have the best life you can have.
And that means you' re getting a diploma.
When I graduate, I' m gone.
Hey, Charlie, am I looking okay for national TV?
You know, you turned into a jerk when we moved here!
- Everybody turned into a jerk when we moved here.
Charlie?
Mom' s home.!
- Mommy!
- Mommy!
- Mommy!
Never go away again!
- Hi.
- Mom, listen up.
- I missed you, honey.
Okay, Dad is stressed to the point of a total meltdown.
Charlie' s like a half a step away from juvie, and Mark' s --
Okay.
We' il talk about it later.
Here we go.
- I just wanna get everything ready.
- What' s the deal with Charlie?
- Fine, thanks.
- I' m sorry.
Hi.
Charlie got kicked off the football team.
- What?
I' m handling it.
- [Sighs]
President Gerhard.
- Tom, we need a minute.
- Please don' t die, Beans.
The university is prepared to make an investment in the program... but we want some assurances.
- We wanna know you' re committed to the football program.
You have to decide who' s making the bacon and who' s cooking it.
So what' s it gonna be, Tom?
Tom, didn' t you pick up my dry cleaning?
Yes, dear.
It' s in the front closet.
Well, I guess the wife just answered our question.
The wife' s name is Kate, Shake.
What a wiener.
We want an answer by Monday, Tom.
This meeting' s over.
I' m all right.
[Doll' s Voice]
I' m gonna go get ready.
- Sorry, Dad.
What' s this?
Hank slept over.
Do you have a problem with that?
Yes, I have a problem with that!
This house is G- rated.
Whoa, chief.
Look, Nora' s a big girl.
Now would be an excellent time... for you to be very, very quiet... chief.
Now, get dressed and get downstairs.
I just -- I can' t believe you let things get this bad around here.
- I can' t believe it.
You didn' t pick the perfect moment to have a career.
I' m not even gonna touch that hypocrisy.
You told me to go to New York.
Mr. I Can Handle It.
"Everything' il be okay.
Go, Kate! "Help me, would you?
So you' re telling me you didn' t want to go to New York?
No.
I want a lot of things.
- That' s the problem.
- This isn' t working.
That' s my point.
- I meant the zipper.
Let' s just get through the next hour, okay?
- Fine.
- Fine.
[Kate]
I know it' s been a difficult day... but I need all of you, and I would appreciate it if you could just put on happy faces.
Everything' s great.
We' re a big, happy family.
If you can remember the lines I told you to say to Oprah.
If you can' t remember, don' t say anything.
Mom, Beans is dead.
Nobody cares about your stupid frog, FedEx.
Stop calling me that!
- Don' t you dare call him that.!
[Yelling Continues]
- [Tom]
All right.!
- Stop it!
What' s the name of this segment again?
Uh, "One Big Happy Family."
Okay, I' m calling Oprah' s people right now.
All I' m saying is, families are inevitable.
It' s like death or taxes.
Does that mean you don' t want children?
Leave him alone.!
- Hello!
Look at these -- They' re monsters!
- [Yelling Continues]
That' s why you' re with me.
Nora.!
We need you down here.!
[Lorraine]
You' re stepping on me.!
Nigel, get off your brother' s head.!
Get off me!
Nobody cares about me!
- Nobody cares about me!
- Mark, what' s going on?
- Mark.!
- What are you talking about?
- I' m perfect!
I' ve never done anything like this before!
- No!
- Hey!
Hey!
- No, you do not want to come down here.
No, it' s the farthest thing from a happy family.
Why am I the only normal person in the family?
Feel free to sleep on the couch.
You read my mind.
Daddy, are you and Mommy gonna get a divorce?
Come here.
I' m sorry.
I' m sorry.
Mark' s gone.
- Mark' s gone.
- What?
Hey, Dad.
What I said before -- I was out of line.
Forget it.
You were right.
- [Children Yelling]
- [Phone Ringing]
Hey, Mark ran away.
Is he with you?
We' il come help you look.
[Chuckles]
- Mark' s missing.
[TVNarrator]
Take it to the max.
Let' s go.
I look great.
Did you not hear me?
My brother is missing!
No.
Did you not hear me?
What was that for?
What do you want?
My son Mark ran away.
He' s not here, is he?
I always knew one of your kids would land on a milk carton.
Twelve is just too big a number.
- We' il help you look for him.
- It' s- It' s past Dylan' s bedtime.
We' re gonna look for him, Tina.
- Thank you.
Let the police handle it!
You' il never find him!
Oh, we' il find him.
Like you said, 1 2' s a big number.
- Mark!
Mark!
- Mark.!
He' s about, about -- about that high.
He' s got red hair and glasses.
There' s a photo, and you can keep that.
I' ve been everywhere.
Thanks for looking.
- Where' s Hank?
- He' s not gonna make the cut.
I hope the family isn' t to blame.
They' re totally to blame.
I' il have officers check the train and bus stations.
- He wouldn' t get on a train or a bus.
Those times when I ran away from Midland, I was gonna go to Chicago.
My favorite place in the world.
Your favorite place in the world.
You said we' d be happier.
You didn' t keep your promise.
I' m sorry.
Mom.!
Oh, honey!
Oh, we missed you, sweetheart.
Do that again, I' m going to have to pound you.
- But I thought I was FedEx.
- Your eccentricities and vision problems... are genetic traits that could be attributed to any number of the Baker ancestors.
Without you, we wouldn' t be the 1 2 Bakers anymore.
We' d be, like, 1 1.
I figured everybody hated me like Sarah and Lorraine hate each other.
There are times when I want to kill Sarah... but I' d kill for her all the time.
- [All Laughing]
You wanna say something?
A few words?
Sure.
Beans was a good frog.
He was, uh, not like a lot of the bad frogs... you hear about today, all hopped up.
- [Chuckles]
He was almost human.
He was like, uh, one of the family.
Except that, of course, he was green and he ate flies.
But he was a hopper.
He hipped and he hopped.
He loved hip- hop.
Mark, why don' t you -- I think you should say something.
For a long time, you were the only person I could talk to.
That' s different now.
But you' re the one who got me through.
Thanks.
I' m resigning after the season, Shake.
Giving up the dream, huh?
Just going with a different one.
No regrets?
If I screw up raising my kids... nothing I achieve will matter much.
Thank you.
We' il make an announcement at the end of the week.
Come on.
We gotta get this done.
- Where' s Dad?
- He went to the game.
Why didn' t he ask us to go?
Because... he didn' t want you to be there on the day that he quits his job.
- He' s quitting his job?
- What would we have to do so he wouldn' t quit?
- I' il give up clarinet lessons.
- [All Talking At Once]
Okay, ease up.
Everybody listen.
Dad' s a big boy, and he makes his own decisions... and he' s doing this because it' s what he wants.
In that case, I totally take back what I said about the hand- me- downs.
Anybody else wanna take back their offer?
[Chuckles]
I guess you could say that when Tom and I left Midland... we had a mess of theories about how to raise children.
We still have a mess of children, but no theories.
Sure, 1 2 is still our number.
It' s the number of months my book was on the best- seller list.
It' s the number ofjob offers Tom turned down before we found one close to home.
And each day, it' s the number of times I' m thankful there' s such a thing as family.
What happened to you?
Oh, my God!
Save the eggs!
Yeah, you got room for all your big old family in that new apartment?
You' re on camera, Steve.
You idiot.
Yeah, you got room in your new apartment for that --
Battle ax of a wife of mine?
You got -- [Director]
- I really am grumpy.
Two times?
- Two times.
Ready?
Actually, we' re almost done, so let' s do it.
On your mark, get set, go.!
[Together]
I don' t wanna move!
I don' t wanna move!
Goodjob.
Okay?
I listened -- I listened the "goodest."
I don' t wanna do it anymore.
- One more time.
- Last one and you' re outta here.
- [Frog Croaking]
- Cut!
Somebody help me!
Help me!
- Just for the record, Mom --
Be careful, pally.
Slow down on that stuff.
You' re not gonna remember a damn thing in school if you suck 'em back like I do.
Now, on the end around the guard pulls.
That means you, Buttler.
- [All Laughing]
- Frankly, I' m concerned.
I go around those kids, they start beatin 'on me.
What if I get a black eye?
Frankly, I' m concerned, honey.
The kids set me on fire, they beat me.
They' re abusive.
This is how I get jobs, right here!
I looked at myself in the camera.
I' m so -- good- looking.
- Sounds good to me.
- All the kids wrapped in duct tape.
Maybe we can just roll, roll ourselves in duct tape... and then I can just roll you across the floor.
Together, maybe.
Ow!
You don' t like me because I don' t sign autographs.
You don' t like me because I don' t smile for the camera.
You don' t like me because I don' t suck up to the press.
You don' t like me because I make a lot of money.
Because I' m one of the greatest hitters alive.
We' re back in Milwaukee, and the sound you hear reverberating across the cities and farms of the great state of Wisconsin is the roar of the Brewer faithful for their longtime hero, Stan Ross.
And here he comes with that trademark arrogant scowl.
2, 999 hits to date in his illustrious career.
Will this at- bat, July 29, 1995, against the rookie right- hander Billy Earil, be the historic moment when Ross joins only 20 other major leaguers in that elite 3, 000- hit club?
You' re gonna be the best- looking cat in the Hall of Fame, that' s for doggone sure.
You want my autograph now or after I make history?
You ain' t getting this hit off me.
This is gonna be your one career highlight.
You' re gonna be a game- show answer.
Well, I' il take "Kiss my Ass" for $1, 000.
Make it 3, 000.
You hear that language on that rookie?
Kiss my ass.
You' re gonna tell me to kiss your ass, too?
Why don' t you suck my...
I' il put up this...
He know better than to get me pissed off!
No pitcher wants to be the one that gives up that 3, 000th base hit.
A purpose pitch to get Ross angry.
Come on, this is the one.
You know what I' m talking about!
Hope he trips and breaks his leg.
It' s a vicious line drive off Earil' s...
That' s what it is.
Stan Ross is safe at first.
Hey, Coach, get me that ball.
That' s the ball that got me to the Hall of Fame.
- You want this ball, Ross?
Thanks, man.
There goes your damn ball.
You see that, Coach?
You see what he just did?
He threw my Hall of Fame ball in the stands.
What' s your problem?
Back up.
- Move, man!
You be out when I get back, or someone will have to pull a piece of baseball history out the crack of your ass!
- What you looking at?
- Make a move.
Okay, I' il shrink your big ass.
You' il get some, too.
You saw what he did, Coach.
All right, guys.
Get back in.
Who got my ball?
Open that gate.
He' s coming on up.
Hey, congratulations, Stan!
Give me my ball.
- What?
- What' d he say?
Give me my 3, 000- hit ball.
Don' t look at your daddy.
Give me my ball!
Whoa, make him a trade at least.
Give him your cap or an autographed bat.
What the...
Are you all right, pal?
Why don' t you take his cotton candy while you' re at it?
Were you glad to get number 3, 000 here in Milwaukee?
Sure.
You ask any of the all- time greats, man.
We all got a special connection with our hometown fans.
What connection did you make with that kid who caught the ball tonight?
What you talkin 'about?
People in that section say you threatened him.
I gave him good advice.
What the hell wrong with you people?
Stan Musial, and Carl Yastrzemski.
Y' all gonna try to speak on something negative?
That' s why I' m quittin '.
- What?
What do you mean, quitting?
Quittin '.
Hangin 'it up.
Now that I got this, I ain' t playin 'no more.
- That' s right.
I' m talking to you.
And I said "stank- ass."
Why now with the Brewers still in the race?
Couldn' t you wait until after the season?
I' d have quit last season if I didn' t think you were gonna try to block me from the Hall of Fame.
3, 000.
Like it or not, I' m a certified immortal.
Nothin '.
This is St. Patty' s Day.
Get your shamrock groove on at Stan Ross' Mr. 3000 Sports Bar,
located on Peacock Street in Waukesha County.
We got 3, 000 different kind of beers.
We got Wild Irish Rose and anything that you might want.
There' s more.
You want to get that heavy vibration from that special someone?
Get your page on at 3000 Beeps.
Get your hair dyed, fried, and laid to the side at 3000 Cuts.
Knickknack patty- whack, get your dog a bone.
And get your woof on at 3000 Paws.
Get your Szechuan feast on at 3000 Woks.
Bring the whole family down to Mr. 3000 Shopping Center.
First year, I was 150 votes short.
Come here.
Second year, I was less than 50 and so on.
Last year, I was just 4 votes away.
Sportswriters hate me.
But my numbers don' t lie.
I got 3, 000 up there, one for each one of my hits.
They gotta let me in.
It' s my year, and everybody knows it.
What about him?
Who' s that?
You know who that is.
That' s T- Rex Pennebaker.
Best player on the Brewers.
T- Rex Pennebaker ain' t nothin '.
I don' t even know why you bother learning his name, especially what you got in front of you, a living legend.
And I know you don' t know a lot of immortals.
Hey, easy, old man.
Old man?
What you mean is "aged," like U. S. D. A. Beef.
It' s what' s for dinner.
Not on my plate.
Monstrous.
Mnh- mnh.
- Spring training.
You can practically smell the grass, can' t you?
Can' t say I can, man.
What, you don' t miss it?
Nah.
Stan didn' t make many friends when he was playing here.
He wasn' t very good with the press.
We invited him to Old- timers' Day every year since he retired.
That' s nine years.
And he never RSVP' d once.
He might not want to do this, you know what I' m saying?
What are you saying?
I' m just saying, "Stan Ross Day."
Retire his number.
The fans, man.
Did he go for it?
Did you hit him with the fans bit?
How about where you say you didn' t know if I would do it?
Boca, I swear, when you get to going, you can talk a stripe off a zebra.
Monstrous.
And welcome to beautiful Miller Park.
Ladies and gentlemen, we' re here today to retire number 21, worn by one of the Brewers' all- time greats.
Seven times an All- Star, a member of that exclusive 3, 000- base- hit club, the Wizard of Wood, the Count of Contact, and the King of the Swing,
Milwaukee' s own Mr. 3000, Stan Ross!
Damn!
I still look good.
He hasn' t lost his touch, has he?
let' s welcome former teammate Bill "Big Horse" Berelli.
Who?
He was a middle reliever.
What happened to Paul Molitor, man?
Robin Yount?
Cecil Cooper?
What happened to them?
They declined.
We' re lucky we got him.
That he wasn' t a team player.
But I' m here to tell you that if you get 3, 000 hits, you don' t have to be a team player.
What?
If you have a lifetime. 314 average, you don' t have to be a good guy.
If you lead the league in batting for three years, you can be the biggest jerk in the world.
He laughin ', man.
So on behalf of all of us who played alongside of you, congratulations.
Go on, go on, man.
You can' t help me now.
Also here with us today, you remember him well, number 8, Anthony Carter.
Tell them like it is, Boca.
Now we' re talkin '.
Me and Stan were teammates.
Man, could he hit the ball.
Tell 'em, baby.
And I loved him for that.
I love you more.
That' s it?
I' m trying to get enshrined.
That' s it?
Man, y' all killin 'me, man.
let' s hear it for our Brewers' own Stan Ross!
Thank you so much.
First, I want to thank you, Mr. Schembri, and the entire Milwaukee Brewers organization.
And to my main man, my best friend, Boca Carter.
And to you, Old Donkey.
- Big Horse!
- Whatever!
The fans.
You were always there for me.
I' d have been in the Hall of Fame a long time ago.
But unfortunately, it' s up to a bunch of sportswriters.
Some metalhead half- asses.
How the hell do you bat 3, 000 and not be selected into the Hall of Fame?
What type of bullshit is that?
Let me tell you something.
You- all believed in me when I was at my best.
You- all believed in me when I was at my worst.
You, the fans!
I can depend on you- all to bring me, Stan Ross, to Cooperstown.
I can hear you say "Stan!"
Stan!
Stan Ross!
Stan Ross!
He' s the boss!
He' s the boss!
Say "Hall of Fame"!
Hall of Fame!
It' s a damn shame!
Over here, say, "Hell, yeah"!
Hell, yeah!
Say, "You' re the man"!
You' re the man!
Let me hear it again!
You' re the man!
- You' re the man!
Hang on.
What?
Yeah.
We were running that for Stan Ross.
A list of every one of his 3, 000 hits.
- There' s an error.
- One of the hits was an error?
No, all the hits were hits.
There just aren' t 3, 000 of them.
Start over.
Okay, there was a game in May 1982 that was called for curfew.
Once in May, once in August.
Stan Ross had three hits in that game.
That means that three of the hits don' t count.
- So you' re telling me...
- 2, 997 hits.
As Yahko tried to escape across the rope bridge, he realized that he was trapped by both sides by the dreaded, evil boars.
Yahko knew his only hope was to do the unthinkable, and that was to jump far, far below into the raging, raging river.
Hold on, kids.
Hello?
Hey, man, the press is eating it up.
What happens to Yahko?
- What?
- What happened to Yahko?
Shut up!
I can' t believe you said that.
2, 997?
Man, that' s bullshit!
- Please, the children.
- Man, hell with the kids!
Yahko' s dead!
The Hall of Fame vote is in, and Stan Ross is not.
- Stan' s gonna wait - Turn it off.
Till next year to wait till next life.
I can' t let them do it to me.
I can' t let them take away my legacy.
# I got somethin 'that tells me #
I' m back!
The King with the Swing, the right arm they call "The Gun,"
Stan Ross.
Nitroglycerin himself.
Number 21, the man with sweetest swing in the major league, is back.
You gotta be joking.
50?
47 and getting younger.
That' s why I love you, man.
Man, what the hell?
What' s your damn problem, man?
That was 4/ 10 of a second.
That' s how much time you have after the ball leaves the pitcher' s hand to decide whether it' s a fastball, a split- finger.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
You played in the majors?
Figures.
He' s drunk.
No, I' ve just been a Brewers fan my whole life while you treated the team and the fans and the city like dirt.
Yo, Boca, get this man another bottle.
- Thank you.
- You' re welcome.
- I want you to try it again.
- What?
'Cause last time I wasn' t standing at the plate.
Yeah.
See that?
Three more hits.
As I said before, Stan Ross is back.
Better talk to him, Boca.
Stan.
I thought when we retired his number, we wouldn' t have to see that prick anymore.
He' s a senior citizen.
Do you think I want him here?
And he hasn' t played the game in nine years.
It' s not like we' re in the American League anymore, so he' s gotta play the field.
Can he even handle first base at his age, let alone hit?
Fellas.
We are in fifth place, and we are not drawing flies.
And we' ve got two very long months ahead of us.
The biggest crowd we' ve had all year was the day we retired Stan' s number.
Give him a month to get in shape.
Then after that September roster expansion, if he' s up to it, we put him in the lineup.
That' s it, baby.
Look at him.
He got nothin '.
I' m the conditioning coach.
He here to carry you home?
The only thing Boca gonna carry is my plaque.
- That' s why I love you.
- I love you more.
Is that right?
How many push- ups can you do?
One arm or two?
Well, I' il tell you what, last time I counted, what was it, about 40, 50?
I got 5 bucks in my pocket says you can' t give me 10.
Back up, man.
- You better help your boy down.
- He didn' t help me in.
Come on, let' s see what you got.
Okay, well, that' s one.
Oh, I don' t know.
I' d say 40, 50.
That' s four.
You got this one.
Your knee touched, man.
- That' s a girl push- up.
- You see my knee touch?
Well, it might have, yeah.
But who said girl push- ups don' t count?
Yeah, who said girl push- ups don' t count?
How you want to pay me, cash or check?
Oh, look at them arms starting to shake.
Come on.
Okay, Stan, now you ready to get started for real?
Man, what type of shit is this?
Hydrostatic weighing.
It' s how we determine how much body fat you really have.
I don' t need my balls washed to tell you how much I weigh.
Hold your breath, Stan.
This ain' t nothin 'but a Southern baptism.
It' s called modern technology, Stan.
Recently, the Brewers have incorporated new methods of training into their exercise regimen.
We' re gonna get you started on this bad boy.
- Mm- hmm.
This looks like some punishment.
Actually, it' s very gentle.
It' s called Pilates.
Pi- what?
Breathe in.
Okay, feel the extensors now.
I feel like Flipper.
B, that' s what I' m talkin 'about.
I' m gonna start off real light, about 463.
You can throw 463 on if you want to, chicken chest, but your equipment is right over there.
Keep that ass up.
All right, push!
Whoa, where you going?
Is this a joke?
It' s only a joke if you think weak abs are funny.
You ask me about my lats.
Yeah, I feel it.
My spine and my butt, too.
Push it!
Whoa, where you going?
Get back here.
# It' s fun to stay at the Y. M. C. A. #
Stand up.
Sit down.
Come on, now up.
42.
43.
Look at your boy.
- Stan Ross.
- Stan Ross.
- Who are you?
- Stan Ross!
- Louder!
- 'Cause I pay the cost.
- Why?
- 'Cause I' m Stan Ross!
So, tomorrow, man, you ready?
Game' s changed a lot since we last played.
I still see the ball.
I still hit the ball.
All day.
But I do miss playin '.
I know I always said I didn' t, but I do.
Bein 'a part of that great tradition.
I never felt that type of respect that I felt on the ball field.
That kind of attention.
Oh, shoot, that reminds me.
Some ad- agency guy from New York.
Endorsement?
Was it Reebok?
It' s not Reebok.
Adidas or Nike?
Viagra.
What?
You' d be the spokesman.
I ain' t gonna be no damn spokesman for no Viagra.
I can still swing my bat, Bo.
Are we ready to roll here?
Okay, the Milwaukee Brewers are pleased to be able to help a member of the Brewer family reclaim his rightful place in baseball history.
So it is with great pride that I introduce to you the once and future Mr. 3000, Stan Ross.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Schembri, and the Milwaukee Brewers organization.
And I promise, it won' t be like last time when I' m in front of the microphone with all that cussin 'and shit, you know?
Is this only about getting back to 3, 000 hits, or do you believe you can help make the Brewers more competitive on the field?
How could I not make them more competitive?
The Milwaukee Brewers are weak.
- Who they got?
They' re a Little League team.
They need me.
How do you think you' il adjust to the contemporary game?
You ever heard of Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes?
Earth, Wind & Fire?
Some things just always play well.
- You nervous?
What' s that?
I said, "What if you don' t hit?"
If all this talk is just talk and it becomes obvious you' re hurting the team, will you take yourself out of the lineup?
When I say I' m gonna do something, I do it.
That' s not always how it works.
Well, it is for me.
Not the way I remember.
'cause I cold- blood do everything I say I' m gonna do.
Is that the way you were raised?
Straight up and down, like 6: 00.
So what does your mama think about this comeback foolishness?
Why are we getting on this Mama stuff?
Thank you very much.
Just get one more question.
You really nailed him on that one.
Maureen.
What you doing here?
What do you think?
I' m covering the story for ESPN.
Why you, though?
They sent me.
Just by chance, you ain' t here to see me?
No, I' m on assignment.
They asked me to cover a story, so I' m covering it, period.
I' il see you at the ball park.
Wait, wait.
How about an exclusive?
See?
You and me?
You think you' il get three hits in your first three at- bats and get this thing over with?
Come on, Mo, I' m 47 years old.
It' il probably take me maybe four at- bats.
You' re one of a kind, Stan Ross.
Thank you for sitting with us.
Thank you.
Thanks, guys.
That' s a wrap.
- That wasn' t too bad, was it?
- That was great.
After I get my hits today, you want to come by and celebrate?
You know, you better keep your mind on the game, Mr. 3000.
You thinkin ', eh?
Well, we' il see in a few hours, won' t we?
Stan, you da man.
Livin 'legend, baby.
Yes, sir, all you got to do is walk up in there and take those youngsters to school.
Buddy, come here.
Help me out, please, with the zipper.
- Hey, can you give me a hand?
- You best mean a handshake.
You' re Stan Ross.
Huge fan.
You gotta unzip me.
"Stan Ross unzipped my pants."
Oh, crazy?
Thinkin 'I' m crazy?
Stan, Stan, Stan, Stan.
Crazy for asking you to give me a hand!
Yeah, good luck on tonight' s game.
Now, this shit is all right.
Uh- huh, sound effects could be a little bit louder when a brother hit.
That shit should sound like a cannon!
Just Stan.
I' m just Stan.
That' s your locker over there.
MAN ON TELEVlSION:
Go ahead, man, it' s in my locker.
- I' m Stan Ross.
- I know very well who you are.
I grew up watching your excellent play on television.
You are hero to many young Japanese players.
But you have hole in your ass.
Hole in my ass?
- What' s his problem?
- That' s Fukuda.
He was taught English in school in Japan, but they never taught him to cuss worth a damn.
I never did nothin 'to him.
Brother, you' re looking at 25 Little Leaguers in here who want to give you an ass- whupping.
6- 3, man!
6- 4.
I was trying to cheat.
Minadeo, Skillett.
Second and short.
What are you talking about?
No!
- It all got to be in.
It has to go in, all of it.
You' re always trying to pull this.
Does that count?
Grandpa?
- Here it is.
Lineup!
Ah, yes!
Now batting leadoff.
Skills that pay the bills.
Was Panas here yet back when you were playing?
Yeah, he was here.
I don' t think I was one of his favorites.
Ha ha!
Eighth?
That' s for banjo hitters.
Man, I never batted lower than fifth in my life.
You bat that now, you son of my dick.
Son of my dick?
Hey, what size you swinging over there, Old School?
34 ounce, like I always have.
You sure you can still get around with that at your age?
I' ve been swinging this thing sweet before you knew which side of the bat was the good end.
Yeah, I swing a 36 myself.
Yeah, that' s big talk.
I got a hammer my damn self.
Come on, Coach.
Ross, you suck!
How' s it feel, Stan?
How about an interview after the game?
Come on, now, don' t distract me when I' m hittin '.
Hitting' s my business.
- That' s what I' m talkin 'about.
- Lookin 'good, Stan.
Stan!
Still the Wizard of Wood!
Bingo.
I' m about to take care of business.
Charge!
Bottom of the third, and the cheers you hear, and the boos, for that matter, are for Stan Ross.
It' s the reason most of the 38, 000- plus fans are here tonight.
First baseman, number 21, Stan Ross.
Is that right?
Well, I hit pretty hard, son.
Strike one.
Be aggressive.
I am.
Keep your eye on the ball.
I don' t need you to tell me what to do.
Come on in.
I' ve been here before.
This ain' t my first picnic, baby.
Ooh, Stan was a hair off timing that big breaking ball from Hamilton.
Of course, all season, a lot of hitters, who aren' t 47 years old, have been fooled by Hamilton.
And we' re the Little Leaguers?
Not so aggressive, baby.
Focus.
Come on.
Come on, baby.
Strike!
Inside fastball, and Stan Ross is out of there on three straight pitches.
It looks like it could be a long night for the King of Swing.
Welcome to "SportsCenter."
Stuart Scott with you.
We got some more baseball.
Braves at Brewers.
Well, Stan Ross cares.
The first week at bat was a lot like the first week out of the womb for Stan.
A lot of drooling and a lot of just flailing around for the erstwhile King of Swing.
Let' s check out the highlights.
Well, Stan the man more like Stan the statue, just chillin 'at a curve for strike one.
Now, wait a second.
What was it that Stan said about the rest of his team?
The Milwaukee Brewers are weak.
Who they got?
They' re a Little League team.
They need me.
Oh!
Just chillin 'at a called strike three, and, well, that' il get you some halitosis action.
Yeah, when you get just a little too close to the umpire.
He decided to do a little spring cleaning.
Either that, or he just wants to symbolize how well he' s been playing.
Yeah, garbage!
Now, I' m not gonna say that every Brewer but Stan had a hit, but I am gonna say that every Brewer but Stan that played had a hit.
Our Maureen Simmons was at the game and had postgame duty.
Not the day Stan Ross or the Milwaukee fans had in mind.
Word around the organization is that manager Gus Panas is particularly unhappy having Ross back in the lineup.
Stuart.
The press is having a field day.
Hey, they' re just getting even with Stan for all those years of abuse.
For turning this team into a laughingstock.
Five games and hasn' t gotten close to a hit.
How long do we let this go on?
We got 35, 000 people in the park today.
Whether Stan Ross ever gets another hit or not.
You sure you don' t want anything stronger than club soda?
Oh, no, I' m good.
Thanks, Boca.
Why you call him Boca?
Look at him.
He look like he' s ready for Boca Raton with them tracksuits.
Stan don' t appreciate my velour.
That' s all he wears.
Mo, I swear, he has a black one for funerals.
Just comin 'from me, I think my man take his old Reebok endorsement deal a little too serious.
- Hey, a lifetime supply.
- That' s why I love you.
- No, that' s why I love you.
- No, I love you more.
No, I love you more.
No, no, I started the love.
And your life' s been richer ever since.
I hear you.
Nice to see you again, Mo.
Mm, you too, Tony.
So, you hire a fancy decorator to help you do this place?
Girl, you need to quit fightin '.
You know doggone well you thought I was gonna be old and tired when I quit the game.
- You thought it.
But I got news for you.
I own this place, and I own all the stores next door.
3000 Suds, 3000 Woks, and 3000 Beeps.
That' s why you' re comin 'back.
So all them names make sense.
'Cause I deserve to be in the Hall of Fame with the immortals.
You know, you really shouldn' t word it like that.
- Mm- hmm.
- What?
- Oh, you know what.
You better hush.
Let me see something.
- Come here.
- Mnh- mnh.
Look at you, Mo.
And quick still.
You gonna eat this?
You sure got time to eat.
Baby, you hungrier than a hostage.
Ooh, take a bite out of crime.
I thought the lady must have...
Wait, wait, wait.
You don' t train no more.
You don' t drink no more.
'Cause I remember you used to drink half the American League underneath the table.
I realized I had to start cuttin 'loose from those things that weren' t getting me anywhere.
- Where you need to be gettin '?
- On with my life.
Come on.
You know we' re young enough.
Ooh, I don' t think so, Mr. Ross.
Come on, I know you remember what it was like.
You can' t say we didn' t have something special.
Good night.
What about Kansas City?
That was a mind- blowing weekend.
You mean to tell me you forgot about that?
Bye- bye.
Cleveland, when I had your toenails poppin 'off like Redenbacher.
- Bye.
- Come on, how about Toronto?
God.
- Come on, now.
You know I didn' t expect you in Toronto.
- Come on, now.
Don' t give me that crap.
You' re a selfish man.
You always were.
Okay, if you so upset, why was you willing to get back with me?
We got together for a night, but I didn' t stay for breakfast, did I?
We' d still be doin 'it if you didn' t take that ESPN gig.
When there' s a better offer on the table, you gotta take it.
I' il pay for it.
Bye- bye.
The count is 1- 1 on the second baseman Minadeo.
Brewers down by 4.
Runner at first.
They sure could use a little spark here.
Glickman now on the mound, working from the stretch.
Throws to first and picked him off.
Skillett is caught napping.
When is this ball club going to wake up?
Another mistake.
Minadeo steps back in.
Here' s the wind and the pitch.
Swung on, a one- hopper back to the mound.
He bobbles it, but what' s Minadeo doing?
He' s not running.
The throw to first, and he' s out.
Look at that.
There should be a man on first and second right now.
But easy, Gus.
Don' t get excited.
I don' t want you to pop no blood vessel.
What you- all havin ', prayer?
The only shining star on the team these days is their strapping young outfielder, T- Rex Pennebaker.
But even his impressive power numbers have done little to stop the Brewers' losing streak.
Pennebaker digs in.
And here' s the windup and the pitch.
Swung on and a deep, deep drive to left field.
It is gone!
4- 1.
Yet another bases- empty home run for T- Rex Pennebaker.
That right there?
That' s a little somethin 'for "SportsCenter."
Plus, that' s gonna look tight in next year' s video game.
What the hell you call yourself doin '?
Yo, I' m puttin 'the show in the show.
But your team losin '.
Instead of playin ', you makin' like Mr. Bojangles.
I just hit a home run, son.
Maybe you was takin 'a grandpa nap during that part.
But your team gettin 'picked off.
Your boys ain' t beatin 'out grounders.
It should be a ball game right now.
So yell at them, Old School.
I did my job.
You the superstar.
You set the tone.
Listen here.
When you get a base hit in this millennium, then you can come on down there and talk to me.
Is that right?
Yeah, that' s right.
Hey, Stan, you think that diaper' s affecting your swing?
How about a Wiffle bat?
How 'bout I shove my Hall of Fame bat up the crack of your mascot ass?
Make you a hot dog on a stick, bitch.
I might be a sausage with teeth, but you sure as hell ain' t no Hall of Famer.
- # If you disrespect # - What?
# Everybody that you run into #
Looks familiar?
Familiar?
You ain' t changed nothin 'since back in the day.
In fact, I don' t think you even vacuumed.
Well, why mess with perfection?
Oh, I can think of a lot of descriptions for this couch, and "perfection" ain' t one of 'em.
How come I hardly see you on "SportsCenter" anymore?
You know.
They got some pretty young thing they tryin 'to groom.
They can' t treat you like that.
I remember once upon a time I pushed out the 40- year- old.
I been playin 'this game long enough to know how it goes.
But I' ve been lookin 'ahead toward it, you know?
- I' m goin 'behind the camera.
- Oh, you go, girl.
Like I' ve been telling you, you can' t beat Father Time.
Well, how come you really haven' t settled down?
The right man wasn' t right.
What' s the matter with you?
That' s my song.
Come on, bump with me.
Come on.
Don' t leave me hangin '.
Come on out here.
All right, only 'cause I like this song, too.
- Not 'cause I like you.
- I' il take it. - # Whoo, let' s get it on # - Come on.
# Sugar #
Honey, stop chasing the butt.
You know what, Mo?
The best sex I ever had was with you.
- What?
You had girls in every city in baseball.
Why is that?
We do it longer?
Not really.
More positions, then?
Mm- hmm.
More times a night?
Oh, you still hold the record.
I don' t know, baby.
I guess I like the rest of it.
The rest of it?
What' s left?
I like the sleepin 'and the talkin' and hangin 'out and stuff like that.
- # Can never be wrong # - But that' s not sex.
It is to me.
No, it' s not sex.
What you call that, then?
Before we go too far, I can' t spend the night.
- Why not?
- Early flight.
Where you got to go?
I got three games before we go on the road.
- You got to get...
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Are you givin 'up on me, Mo?
- What you got to say?
- I don' t have a say.
I just go where I' m assigned.
You tell 'em I' m startin' to swing the bat good again?
I' m just a reporter.
I don' t make the news or decide what is the news.
- Mnh- mnh.
You just got to make the news, baby.
- Start hittin 'that ball.
- What?
- Come on.
What?
I' m not in the mood right now.
You...
- No.
- Oh, come on, baby.
No, I got a headache.
Really?
You gonna tell me you got cramps, too?
Maybe.
You know...
Whatever.
I' m leavin '.
Lord, just when I thought I' d seen it all.
When you get a base hit in this millennium, then you can come on down...
You think you' il get three hits in your first three at- bats?
T- REX:
When you get a base hit...
You just got to make the news, baby.
Start hittin 'that ball.
One, two, three strikes, you' re out!
Oh, bat boy.
A little testy.
Quite valuable.
If you look on the back, you' il see it' s written in Latin.
Very old card.
It' s on parchment.
He' s now 0- 27 in his comeback.
At what point, Peter, does the rust come off?
I' m not sure it does.
Remember, Jim Palmer tried to come back after he was in the Hall of Fame, and he kept himself in better shape than Ross.
Why does the media hate this guy so much?
He' s a jerk.
Because T- Rex is the best in power and performance.
Find it at Radio Shack.
You' ve got questions.
We' ve got answers.
'Cause I want my hits that got stolen from me.
Those hits are my ticket to the Hall of Fame.
You think three hits are keeping you out?
3, 000 hits, baby, it' s automatic.
Look at me.
You' re out of shape.
That' s not fair, Tom.
He' s a black athlete.
Black athletes age slower.
Mike Tyson didn' t know when to get out.
Michael Jordan struggled, and he was only out two years.
This guy hasn' t played since I was married to my first wife.
It just isn' t possible to get out of his day.
He' s a bad teammate.
- Stan Ross was a great athlete.
- Stan is all about Stan.
The Brewers knew what they were getting into.
It' s a publicity stunt, just like when the White Sox hired that midget.
He' s small.
That guy was small for a friggin 'midget.
It' s like if the Red Sox thawed out Ted Williams, although he' d hit better than Stan.
Listen, Stan' s playing like he' s frozen.
He' s embarrassing me.
He should give it up.
But when an athlete gets to that point, he loses all his pride.
I don' t think he' s embarrassed.
I think he' s having a party at his place, got bitches all around and counting all his money.
I don' t think Stan cares.
He' s embarrassed.
SALLE Y:
Very embarrassing, especially with all the bitches he got around.
You think I should quit?
Do your thing, man.
You think?
I' m just saying.
Yeah, you' re right.
I got three home games against the Astros before we go on the road.
I' m gonna play those games, and that' s it.
If I don' t get a hit, it' s over.
I' m not goin 'on the road.
What you think, Boca?
Do your thing, man.
You think?
I' m just saying.
You' re right.
You want to get married?
I' m serious.
I' ve been waitin '20 years for you to ask me that.
And now that you have, I don' t know.
Yeah, you right.
Dog, come on.
"All My Children."
You need to step up the degree of difficulty, brother.
Asa Buchanan.
- That' s ABC, right?
- Oh!
- Yeah.
- Come on.
Don Roberto.
Oh, that' s the dude with the cologne.
"Guiding Light."
- Wrong!
It' s "Amigas y Rivales."
No, we' re not doing Spanish shows, man.
I don' t know what you' re saying.
What the hell they doing?
Seeing who can name the soaps.
You known me for two years.
- Hey.
Why don' t you have a contest guessin 'which team losin'?
- Come on, Stan.
Get a hit, Grandpa.
Strike!
Charge!
- Strike three!
He tucks his arm in on the curve.
Number 21, Stan Ross.
Out!
You see that?
You see that?
I was all over that nickel curve ball.
Say what, partner?
I said, "It looked like a groundout to me."
He tipped his pitch, and I called it.
- Two years.
- Two years, man!
Watch his right arm.
His elbow go in like this.
Dip, grip, curve ball.
Come on, baby!
Runners lead away, and Fukuda working from the stretch.
The pitch, and a swing and a solid line- drive single to left field.
And another run scores.
The Astros in a position now to break this game wide- open.
You okay?
I don' t want Panas to take me out.
I had a few bad outings in a row, and if I don' t get my face out my ass and get out this inning,
I know the team is going to give me the shoe.
Give you the shoe?
Yeah, the shoe.
Look, don' t be thinkin 'negative out here, okay?
Just keep the ball low and away.
We' il get you out the inning.
Then I' m gonna work on your cussin '.
Let' s go.
Shortstop, number 3, Cecil Gervis.
Gervis, with a 6- game hitting streak, at the plate.
Fukuda checks his sign.
The right- hander from the stretch, checks the runners now, and here' s the pitch.
A big swing and a slow roller towards short.
Skillett charges.
His only play is to first.
He' s safe.
The bases are loaded.
- And Ross is hot.
- That' s the third out!
Ray Charles could' ve called that call!
Last warning.
Damn you, man!
Be with me.
Just be with me.
Let' s go!
Two out!
I don' t know why I bothered comin 'back.
You can' t play.
You definitely can' t ump.
You need to relax before you pop a valve.
- You need to sit your ass down.
Why' s that?
- He' s out!
Right here.
Right here, baby!
Grab some, bitch!
Let' s go, Brewers, let' s go.
That' s all he got.
He lost his slider.
He lost his fastball.
Curve ball.
Watch this.
Watch.
What' d I...
- Listen to what I' m telling you.
If he throw another curve ball,
I' m gonna slap the shit out of T- Rex.
Watch.
Curve ball!
What' d I tell you, baby?
Yo, what are you jawin 'about now, Old School?
You saw it.
Are you still talking about that weak- ass ground ball?
Yeah, I' m talking about it.
All right, let me tell you something, man.
I hit 43 home runs.
43 home runs before you ever even got here, man.
So I don' t need none of that.
So save it!
It' s the 31st time you' ve homered but your team' s lost.
Does that get to you?
My team lost, huh?
You know what, man?
This ain' t my team.
If this was my team, these fools would be hittin 'home runs like I' m hittin'.
And they' d be stealin 'bases like I' m out there stealin'.
I' m the only one out there gettin 'mine.
They ain' t doin 'crap!
We go out there every day, but there ain' t no nine guys.
Whoa!
Boy, that pup sound just like me back in the day, I swear.
No, come here.
Move it over there.
When was the last time you saw a 47- year- old man end an inning with the hidden- ball trick, huh?
Is that the first time you pulled that off in a game?
Are the Brewers goin 'to the World Series?
It was 1989, against the Mariners.
Hold up.
Yeah.
You can' t stand to see another brother gettin 'some attention.
- Boy, that' s what you think?
- Yeah, man, that' s what I think.
You keep talking about your teammates the way you do, boastin 'about yourself, you' re gonna end up all by yourself.
All alone and empty, like you are right now.
You know what' s gonna happen?
They' re gonna retire your number someday, and Big Horse Berelli gonna be standin 'up there with you.
Who the hell is Big Horse Berelli?
That' s my point exactly.
Nice car.
He' s picking up his stride, blowing away the competition.
No pun intended, kids.
Looks like number 3, the Italian sausage, has won the race.
Now batting, first baseman, number 21, Stan Ross.
Charge!
Yo, listen up, y' all.
That was a good game, y' all.
I got one question for you, man.
Yo, man, what the hell was you thinkin '?
Y' all saw Old Man River swimmin 'all up in the dirt for a hit today!
Yo, but listen, man.
How many games we got left in this season?
11.
11 games left, y' all.
And how many games out of third place are we?
7.
7 games.
We' re only 7 games out, y' all.
Now, I don' t see a damn reason why we should settle for being in fifth place, yo!
So let' s get it together, and let' s do this like it' s October!
Brewers on three!
- 1, 2, 3!
- Brewers!
Ohh, but listen.
I' m on third base, right?
Nolan Ryan looking at me like he want to kill me, right?
Boca' s getting ready to bunt.
He' s the real deal.
Plus, I know what he thinkin '.
Yeah, he was thinkin 'that I was thinkin' what he was thinkin '.
Well, I' m ready to sprint towards home.
Boca decided he wanted to swing away.
I wasn' t thinkin '.
Man, wasn' t thinkin '!
I mean, hit a screamin 'liner right past my head.
All I heard...
Hold on.
So, you' re the story again.
Hmm?
I' m hittin 'now.
See, this is the part I' m talkin 'about.
Hey, where you goin '?
I gotta go.
You gotta go where?
I just gotta go.
What' s up?
Look, Stan, it was just sex, right?
I mean, best sex I ever had, too, but that' s all it was.
- What about that?
- That' s your idea of sex.
A man could be wrong.
You said it wasn' t sex.
I' m just trying to go with that.
Wait.
Let me talk to you for a minute.
- Oh, oh, hold on now.
- What?
Wait, look.
Look.
What?
The behind- the- camera stuff you was talkin 'about.
And I' m just wonderin '.
Stan.
Stan, you' re being very sweet.
But we both know that you ain' t never been serious enough to go bringin 'up something like that.
Slugger.
- 1, 2, 3, go.
# Take me out to the ball game, take me out with the crowd #
Yo, yo!
I' m tryin 'to watch a game.
What are you talkin 'about, papi?
This song is baseball.
You want to hear a real baseball song?
# Da da- da- da da da da #
What?
Man, let me tell you something.
When I was a kid on South Side Chicago, we used to play baseball when we got out of school till it got dark, when you couldn' t see your hand in front of your face.
I used to play center field, and every single day, man, Mister Softee ice- cream truck used to park right behind me and play that damn song.
- Told you! - # Da- da- da da- da #
We got a game goin 'on out here.
Come on, we got a shot at third place.
You' re right.
Besides, dog, that was wack!
Fairmount Park, Philly, son.
We had that Good Humor truck.
And this is what baseball music sounds like.
You' re wrong for that.
Don' t make no errors.
It was wrong the way I quit on the team back then.
I was young.
Now batting, shortstop, number 46,
Thurman Yost.
# Hit it! #
- Bitch.
- Good.
Good.
After the game, we pick up a...
Beyatch.
That' s pimp stuff.
Kiss my...
- No, don' t get personal.
No, no, no.
- I didn' t mean it.
- I know.
Stan' s batting average in 1985.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
- Yeah.
Okay, my turn.
Stan Ross' RBls in 1981.
- 91.
- Oh, no, 93!
Let me see that.
Yeah, right.
- Crap!
- 93.
- Let' s play again.
- I don' t want to play.
- You don' t want to play?
- We got a game.
You' re a sore loser.
You know what?
Crybaby!
He' s such a crybaby.
- Oh!
Game tied at 4.
The Astro infield moving in.
And here comes Stan Ross.
He could win the game here with a long fly ball, but you can bet that' s not what he' s thinking.
Infield tight, hitter' s delight.
A great chance to get hit number 2, 999.
Here we go, Stan.
Be a hitter.
Come on, just drive the man in.
A good fly ball, okay?
And here comes the pitch.
He swings, and it' s a high fly ball to right.
It' s carrying well.
It' s to the warning track.
To the wall!
It is gone!
Whoo!
Stan Ross touches them all.
I don' t believe it.
# Feel good #
- 21!
I got your "old man," baby.
Way to go, Stan.
I gave 'em they money worth tonight.
You feel good?
- I feel great.
You looked like a champion out there.
- Go ahead.
Miller Park, standing room only.
- I got it.
43, 000 screaming fans, and they' re there for one reason and one reason only.
To watch the legendary Stan Ross step to the plate and dig in.
Shoot, that ain' t no picture.
That' s a damn Rembrandt.
I agree, and that' s why I' m telling Gus not to play you on the road.
Hold on, man.
What are you talking about?
Man, we' re on a roll.
We' re going for third place.
You' re one hit away from making history, Stan.
Hmm?
You' re takin 'half my at- bats away.
Although I hit a home run, I' m still 2 for 51.
2 for 58!
# Stan Ross is at the plate, the fans, they sit and wait #
Look, what I' m sayin 'is, don' t cut me out.
Come on, now.
You' re 2 for 58.
The team doesn' t need you to get third place.
Come on, let' s face it.
But you, my friend, you have got to start thinking about life after baseball.
I' m talking endorsements, product lines.
A Stan Ross candy bar.
I want you doing press all week long on the road, Stan.
You pull this off, nothing' s gonna keep you out of the Hall of Fame.
You' re a champion.
Congratulations on everything.
You won seven in a row.
You guys could finish third.
Are you really talking to us from the clubhouse?
Well, they' re not gonna play me until I come home, so I might as well do something else with my time.
Stan, how does it feel not to be playing right now?
It don' t feel good, especially the way I' ve been swinging, but that' s Skip' s decision.
I have to go with it because, as you say, we got a chance to make third place.
And they were in fifth place when you got there.
I finally got them playin 'patented Stan Ross baseball.
How' s it feel?
To tell you the truth, we never thought you could do it, and some of us hoped you wouldn' t, so we owe you an apology big- time.
Well, it takes a big man to admit when he wrong, but like my teammate Kenji Fukuda taught me to say...
What the hell is he talking about?
- What does the future hold?
- What about number 3, 000?
What game are you gonna get this hit in?
I think I' m gonna get it on the next at- bat.
Keep your popcorn by your side 'cause it' s comin'.
- Is it gonna be a home run?
Hey, Stan.
I hope you weren' t listening to the trash we were talking about you before you hit your groove.
You know what?
That would have hurt if it wasn' t true.
Hey, girl, you been watchin '?
The whole world loves me again, baby.
Stan Ross, the King of Swing.
Sweetheart, I' m goin 'national.
You know, you' re starting to sound like the old Stan.
No, you' re gettin 'the best of both worlds.
The old and the new Stan Ross.
Team player, baby.
So after you go national with all this press, what' s left for me?
I' m gonna tell you what' s left for you.
I' m gonna give you a special exclusive.
You meet me at the ball park Thursday morning at 9: 00.
Just you, me, and the team.
I called a practice on my day off on our last home stand.
Wait a minute.
Stan Ross called for an extra practice?
Now, I never thought I' d live to see this day.
I guess you are getting a little serious, huh?
Maybe I' m gettin 'serious about you.
I' il see you at practice.
Baby, you owe it to yourself.
Bye.
Oh, boy.
What you gonna do?
Hey, Stan, go get your hit this Saturday, man.
I got tickets for that one.
No, I got tickets for tomorrow!
You- all watch and see.
I got a new idea.
Listen.
I got a new PlayStation game, "Hall of Fame Baseball," where I get a chance to hit against those pitchers that were dead before I was born,
like Walter Johnson and Christy Mathewson, and that candy- ass Cy Young.
Well, you draw up the plans.
You got a call an hour ago from "The Tonight Show."
They want you on there tomorrow.
I' m tellin 'you.
- Here' s the hook.
They want you at the studio at 9: 00.
That' s cool.
But you got that extra practice.
One practice.
I' m talking about Jay Leno.
That' s bigger than the game.
Stan Ross, come on out here!
What' s up?
All on, baby.
Have a seat.
All right.
Team Brewer is on a roll, making a push for third place.
I' m on a roll, too.
Is it once a day?
And then you have a sensible meal for dinner.
Any doggone thing, baby.
- Anything, huh?
- Show you right.
Show you right.
And I can do it all night.
Dave?
Yeah, there' s a large black man hitting on your wife.
- What' s next?
I started my own little stuff right here.
Look at that.
- My own little candy.
- "Ross Bar."
Get a shot of that one.
That is the most ratty- ass candy bar I' ve ever seen.
It' s a piece of loose- leaf paper you wrote "Ross Bar" on.
- Oh, the prototype.
You gotta start somewhere.
You know, I' m an entrepreneur.
Once you get over the initial modesty, I think you' il be fine.
You talkin 'to the ladies' pet the men regret.
I' m Stan Ross.
What' s my name, baby?
Stan Ross!
- They call me what?
- The boss!
- Because I...
- Stan Ross!
Stan Ross.
Be right back right after this.
Don' t go away.
Yes, sir.
Did you see me, baby?
Jay and I did our thing.
That ain' t no ESPN.
I' m talkin 'big- time.
Hey, baby.
Don' t you "baby" me.
I went to the park this morning, and you weren' t there.
Your entire team was there, and you' re a no- show.
Well, I mean...
"Well?" Didn' t you call for the practice?
Besides letting down your teammates, you told me I could interview you.
Well, interview me now.
Come on, turn the camera on.
I' il come right around.
That ain' t nothin '.
Shoot.
Come on, baby.
I' il freestyle it.
- Mark, Steve, are you ready?
- You didn' t ask if I' m ready.
- Let me get on that side.
It looks better.
- All right.
Good.
Come on, baby.
I' m here with Hall of Famer hopeful Stan Ross, who is now just one hit from reclaiming his cherished 3, 000 career hits.
But let' s talk about the name "Mr. 3000."
Fit just right, doesn' t it?
Why is there so much emphasis on the name?
Why do you care so much about it?
Because it identifies greatness.
When you think of Mr. 3000, you think of Mr. Stan Ross, one of the greatest hitters straight up and down.
Who were you before Mr. 3000?
Mr. 3000.
I' m just kidding.
Before that, I was a young black kid on the South Side of Chicago, Stanley Ross, playin 'baseball.
What does Stanley Ross think of Mr. 3000?
He wants his autograph.
- Really?
- Really.
- What about your teammates?
- They don' t need it.
Oh, okay.
So what you' re saying is, your teammates get to see your 3, 000th hit, but not potentially move into third place?
What I' m saying is, thousands of people bought tickets this weekend, not to see us play for third place, but to see me get my hit.
- Damn right.
It' s the same reason why everybody else here.
Same reason why you here, unless you' re here for something else.
Oh, okay.
You selfish son of a bitch!
- You don' t want that on- camera.
- No, I' m fine.
Because I' m not the one who' s desperate to live his entire life in front of the camera.
Tell them about Toronto and the history you left there.
- That' s so old.
- Your damn ego is so old!
It hasn' t changed, Stan.
I mean, how am I supposed to think about moving here when you can' t do what you say you' re gonna do?
Mo, it' s only one damn practice, baby.
You know it' s bigger than one practice, Stan.
But you' re right.
I am here to record your history in the making.
And it' s the same as it ever was.
You gonna run after her?
I' il catch her later.
I got ball games to play.
- Whew.
No, I' m just saying, man, that' s why I love you, man.
Wait a minute.
What do you mean?
I' m just saying that I could always count on you to do your thing, you know?
You' re consistent.
You' re always driven.
And you' re always for yourself.
You sayin 'that' s a good thing?
I' m just saying.
Just two weeks ago, fans, the Milwaukee Brewers seemed willing to accept their perennial position in the division cellar.
Is it more than a coincidence that their solid defense and clutch hitting started with Stan Ross' 2, 998th hit?
While Ross was just a spectator during their last road trip,
T- Rex Pennebaker has emerged as the team leader.
We' ve all witnessed the mounting frustration for Ross, who has gone hitless in the first two games against the Astros in this, his final home stand.
You can' t help but wonder what' s going through his mind as Ross' window of opportunity to join that elite 3, 000- hit club is about to close and close before a nationwide audience.
The stage is set.
A re- energized team plays for respectability, while Stan Ross knocks on the door of baseball greatness.
Tonight, 35, 000 fans witness as history unfolds over nine innings of Brewers baseball.
Last chance to go out there and get yours.
We have a lineup change tonight.
In hopes of squeezing out an extra at- bat for Ross, he' s hitting cleanup right behind Rex Pennebaker.
Now batting, first baseman, number 21,
Stan Ross!
This big crowd is charged tonight.
The right- hander Norton, one of the most competitive pitchers in the league, will do everything he can to avoid being a footnote in baseball history.
One game, one more hit, and he has that magical 3, 000.
Ball.
They' re on their feet, rooting for Ross to get ahold of one, as Norton gets his sign.
Ross puts a good swing on it.
It' s deep to right field and carrying well.
Damn.
Why don' t you take a seat?
You ain' t gettin 'that hit off me tonight!
Deal with it!
- This guy' s slider sucks.
- Come on, man.
I guess somebody should have showed up to that practice.
It' s still a scoreless tie.
This crowd ripe with anticipation every time Ross steps to the plate.
Ross swings.
A sharp ground ball up the middle.
Second baseman Gomez with a diving stop.
He scrambles.
It' s gonna be close.
He' s out!
Oh, my, what a close play!
From our angle, I thought he was safe.
I' m surprised Stan Ross isn' t protesting the call.
- That man was safe!
- That man was out.
I called the man out.
I' m watching the same game you are!
- We are playing for third place!
- The man was out!
Don' t make me run you, Gus.
You got your head so far up your ass, you didn' t see the play!
- That' s right!
- That' s what I said!
You' re outta here!
Let me tell you something!
You' re the worst umpire in this whole league!
The man was safe!
He was safe!
- Get him off my field!
You were safe!
Come on, tiger.
He was safe!
So it boils down to the bottom of the ninth inning.
Still scoreless here in the final game of the season.
"Mr. 2999" very likely will be making his last plate appearance of a storied big- league career.
But first the man who' s become sort of Ross' protege of late,
T- Rex Pennebaker.
We' ve got an interesting situation here, fans.
Go, T!
Get on.
Come on, get on, baby.
Just get on.
And that ball is crushed.
A line drive to deep left center.
It' s going, going.
It is off the base of the wall.
Pennebaker rounds first, heading for second.
And he is safe with a ringing double.
He almost took the bat right out of Stan Ross' hands.
But now Ross is up with not only a chance for his 3, 000th base hit and a call from Cooperstown, but an opportunity to drive in the winning run and end the Brewers' season on a high note.
3, 000, baby!
All right.
Come on.
Ball.
- Let' s go, man.
Get your hit.
- Ball.
- Pitch to me, damn it!
Reach out there and get it, then.
Reach out and get it.
Those first two deliveries, way outside.
Ross now crowding the plate.
2 balls, no strikes.
Nothing close from Norton.
I' m right here!
Here we go.
3- 0, the count.
This crowd roaring, begging Norton to challenge Ross with a decent pitch.
I could always count on you to do your thing, you know?
You' re consistent.
You' re always driven.
And you' re always for yourself.
That' s why I love you.
Ross lays a sacrifice bunt up the first- base line, and T- Rex isn' t stopping at third.
Here' s a throw to first base, and Ross is out.
Here comes the play.
The slide, the tag.
He is safe!
The Brewers win!
Corny enough for you?
Well, it gets worse.
First off, now all of a sudden, the press loves me.
Took 'em long enough, though, huh?
The Hall of Fame voted me in on the very next ballot.
And old Mo.
She decided to move back to Milwaukee after all.
I know she said I' d never get serious, but these days, I' m even thinkin 'about gettin' married.
You know, so I can have that great sex all the time.
And hot damn, if Boca didn' t just up and move to Boca.
I can see him right now, helping some lost soul, sayin ',
- Do your thing.
And me, I retired again, like you probably figured.
But I didn' t want to go out without leavin 'the fellas a little somethin' to remember me by.
I couldn' t stay too far from it, so I bought me that song.
And that' s the whole story.
Like my baby Mo says,
"It' s all about figurin 'out who you are."
And some of that' s just a matter of gettin 'a little older and acceptin' it.
And I can deal with that.
Just 'cause I' m retired don' t mean I' m invisible.
In fact, I' m guessin 'you' ve probably seen my commercial once or twice yourself.
# The best is yet to come #
I, Reuben, take you, Lisa...
I, Reuben, take you, Lisa, to be my lawfully wedded wife.
I do.
I do.
Oh, thanks.
And all the candles have been replaced... with these mini- lamps you asked for, so now no more fire hazard.
Great.
Reuben!
- The best man is in the house!
- Oh, my God.!
Jorgé, ice.
The best man went down.
Dance floor' s like a Slip 'N Slide, dude.
I thought I told them not to wax this.
Okay.
All right.
It' s my job to worry.
I' m good.
You got my note that Harry Bard at table seven is violently allergic to seafood?
His chicken will go nowhere near the fish.
This looks great.
Lisa' s gonna love it.
Hit me, dude.
Hey, aren' t you that kid from Crocodile Tears?
That' s right.
I' m Sandy Lyle.
Man, I saw that movie in high school.
That bagpipe scene, that was the funniest shit, man.
We had a good time on that picture.
Ah, no, thanks.
It' s good to see you, man.
I thought you died, like, 15 years ago.
I' ve been doing a lot of stage acting.
Getting back to my roots.
- They' re making an E.!
True Hollywood Story on me, so that should clear up a lot of your questions.
Yeah.
It' s gonna be huge.
Wow.
That' s cool.
Reuben.
Two- minute warning.
Okay, thanks.
Look, Reuben.
Yeah.
And I' m your wingman.
What?
Are you sure you wanna do this?
Sandy, there' s not a doubt in my mind.
Okay?
We' re totally in love.
My life' s working out just like I planned.
Let' s go get married.
- Mazel tov.!
Kiss each other.
Big smile, everyone!
You love each other.
Smile, Grandma.
Having fun. -??
I' m Stan Indursky, Reuben' s boss.
Thank you.
You' re very kind.
Now, Reub' s not the sort of fellow to brag about his own success, so I' m going to do it for him.
The fact is, this young man here... is the best risk assessment expert... in this whole meshugas we call the insurance business.
Irving, Vivian, you' ve raised a wonderful son.
Let' s hear it for him.
Reuben, Lisa, let me just say... that I would insure your marriage any day of the week.
Mazel, you two.
[Woman]
Oh, and, Lisa, don' t tire him out too bad on the honeymoon.
- I need this kid fresh when he gets back.
- Mazel, mazel.!
Good things.
I' ve been waiting for this day my entire life.
Lisa.!
Yeah, not good enough.
She' s a killer.
No, seriously, um...
[Woman]
And I couldn' t be happier... that on this day that I' ve been dreaming about for so long, the woman I' m standing next to... is you.
[Lisa Laughing]
I lost my shoe!
Look at this place!
It' s beautiful.
What?
[Screams]
It' s okay.
You know, it' s a little sore.
You know, they really should tell you if they' rejust gonna let komodo dragons run loose around the hotel.
Really.
How about this one?
Let' s see.
Sweetie, remember?
We took a virtual tour of this one on the Internet.
It was perfect, but just a little pricey.
That' s right.
It' s probably off the market anyway.
Why do you say that?
'Cause I bought it.
You what?
I bought it!
Reuben, I' m in shock.
I mean, you just... you don' t... you don' t do things like that.
Yes, I do, but, Reuby...
We have a house!
Oh, my God, we have a house!
Honey!
- [Laughs]
- [Chuckles]
Thank you.
So I see you gang are new to the island.
I want to come have a meet with you, show you my boat.
That is my boat there on the sandbar.
- Yeah, it' s pretty good size.
It' s good size.
So, tell me true, are you guys for scuba?
What does that mean?
I' m like the unofficial scuba king of St. Barts, so if you are for scuba, I take you out on the boat,
I show you the coral reef, and we have kinda like a...
That sounds great, but we' re not certified, so we' re gonna have to pass.
That is no biggie.
I get you resort- certified couple of hour.
- Yeah?
Good.
What is, uh, you guys' name?
Uh, my name is Reuben.
This is my wife, Lisa.
"Leuban," I am here all afternoon.
All right, au revoir, Leuban, Lisa.
Solid.
Solid.
Hello.
How' s it going?
Lisa!
Hey.
Hi!
Hello.
Isn' t this exciting?
It is.
Reuben, no.
They all said that this guy was the best.
I know, but you know how I am about boats, and I' m feeling a little queasy.
Oh, no.
Your stomach' s acting funny?
You know how it gets, you know?
We' re on our honeymoon.
I' m not gonna go without you.
No!
I want you to go, okay?
It' il be fun.
I' il pick you up like at 4: 00, all right?
I love you too.
No, Claude.
- I' m gonna go run some errands in town.
You have fun.
- Of course.
- [No Audible Dialogue]
Hey, listen, this woman means more to me than anything else in the world, so be careful 'cause scuba can be very dangerous if the proper precautions aren' t taken.
Leuban, look to me in my eyeball.
I promise you I take care of Lisa as if she were my own flesh and blood.
Okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Solid.
Okay.
Are you ready?
Yeah, yeah.
So is there gonna be a little boat that comes over...
Alley- oop.
Bye- bye, honey.!
I love you.!
We' rejammin '??
Claude!?
Guys?
Hello.!?
We' rejammin '??
Lisa?
[Metal Clanging]
[Lisa Moaning]
Ooh la la.!
[Glass Shatters]
Oh, my God!
Holy shit, Leuban!
This is not what it look like.
- You' re staying on the island with Claude?
- I' m a little confused right now, Reuben.
What did you do to her?
Did you mess around with her oxygen tanks or something?
I did nothing, Leuban.
It is "Reuben"!
We cannot help it.
It is like love at first sight.
- Ohh!
Reuben, itjust... it happened.
It' s like the story of the hippo.
I' m not familiar with that story.
The hippopotamus, he is not born going, "Cool bean, I am a hippo."
No way, José.
So he tried to paint the stripe on himself to be like the zebra, but he fool no one.
And then he tried to put the spot on his skin to be like the leopard, but everyone know he is a hippo.
So at certain point, he look himself in the mirror, and hejust say,
"Hey, I am a hippopotamus, and there is nothing I can do about it."
And as soon as he accepts this, he live life happy.
Happy as a hippo.
You understand?
- I' m gonna kill you!
- Reuben.!
- Leuban, this is not the way!
You' re gonna be fine, Reuben.
No, I' m not gonna be fine.
- [Engine Starts]
'Cause this ship has sailed.
Hey, Tina.
Hey, Mitch.
Hey, Reub.
- Cheryl.
Indursky and Sons, how may I help you?
What?
How does everyone know about this?
Your mother called Mr. Indursky and told him what happened.
I am so sorry, Reuben.
Thanks, Gladys.
Okay.
Thank you.
All right.
I know, I know.
Hey, there he is!
The big man' s back.
I want to spitball something with you.
I' m just gonna run to the men' s room.
I' il join you.
I heard about your honeymoon.
Just terrible.
I knew that girl was a slut the second I met her.
Hey, don' t make excuses.
She' s a dime- store hooker, and she always will be.
Just put it behind you.
Speaking of which, you ever hear of a guy named Leland Van Lew?
Australian guy, right?
Exactly.
[Farts]
Yeah, he started one of those high- tech, modem- scrotum,
Jesus Christ.
They want to take the company public, and if he wants to remain the C. E. O. Of a publicly held company, guess what he needs.
Bingo was his name.
All right, you want me to check him out?
There' s just one catch.
This Van Lew has a reputation as a cowboy.
[Splashing]
All right.
Well, let' s make sure he checks out first and...
This is why you' re the only one I can trust with these jobs.
I was worried that you' d been through hell and back with that whore wife of yours.
I' m good.
Absolutely sure?
Yeah, no, I' m fine.
All right, good things.
Excuse me.
This is private property.
No, I know.
I just bought this house.
I move in next month.
Feffer.
Yeah, but you can just call me Reuben.
- Okay, then.
Welcome to the neighborhood.
- Thanks.
Sorry about your wife, Reuben.
First of all, I just want to say thank you to everybody for coming out, and this has just been an incredible day and night.
It' s just so great to see all these people, friends and family and...
To tell you the truth, I' ve been waiting for this day my entire life.
Oh.
Thanks, Sandy.
Thank you.
We' re rolling.
Sound speed.
What the hell is this?
True Hollywood Story on me.
Sorry about your wife.
Sandy, do you want us over here?
Put it over by the table.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Is this better?
Oh, yeah, thanks.
I' m not going to a party.
What do you think is gonna happen?
No, of course not.
I' m just... -
I mean, what can I say?
Hold on.
Man, it feels good to say that.!
Ah, and, uh...
Man, it feels good to say that!
- Check out her expression.
She' s terrified.
- She' s smiling.
- I' m a student of acting, Reuben.
She' s faking it.
The woman got spooked.
She needed to explore, which is exactly what you' re gonna do.
You' ve been given the gift of freedom.
Don' t turn your back on that.
I don' t want freedom, Sandy!
I want to be married!
I bought a goddamn house!
- [Laughing]
- Look at her.
She' s not thinking about having a deep, committed relationship... with a complex individual like yourself.
- No.!
She' s daydreaming about having hot, shallow sex with a French nudist.!
Oh, I love you so much.
"Liar.!
So whose party is this again?
It' s an art opening for this Dutch guy, Jost.
His art sucks, but he used to sell me really good pot.
Oh, man, I' m so friggin 'horny.??
Look, just don' t leave me alone, okay?
Relax.
I' m your wingman.
I' il be right by your side the whole time.
Do we, like, get a drink... or take a lap around the...
Sandy?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
I haven' t noticed.
I' m appreciating the art.
I' m not looking for cute guys.
Oh, so you' ve sworn off men since you dumped your last boyfriend?
We went out for like three days.
It was two months!
Really?
Yeah.
I hope he doesn' t have to buy that now.
Oh, my God!
I think I know that guy.
[Bell Rings]
Uh, yes.
I' m Polly...
Prince.
You were next to me...
Yes!
No, it' s coming back to me now.
You left before high school.
My mom and I, we moved to Michigan.
Yeah, moved here a few months ago.
So, you know...
Yup.
Yeah, that' s Roxanne.
She does that with, uh, bread, wine bottles and...
Anyway, uh, so what' s your deal?
No, I' m not.
I' m single.
Yeah, I haven' t taken the plunge.
Yeah.
Remember?
Hey, how you doing?
Wow.
Okay.
Last time I saw you, you were playing bagpipes in that movie.
Yep, that' s me.
[Laughs]
Polly, can I have a word with you?
Sorry.
Excuse us.
What happened to you?
Reuben, I' m in a situation here.
No.
Dude, no.
This is serious.
I just sharted.
I don' t know what that means.
I just sharted.
Now let' s go.
You' re the most disgusting person I' ve ever met in my life.
Polly?
Focus for one second, okay?
I' m sorry.
I got to go circulate.
So, Sandy, you' re good though?
I am.
Yeah.
It' s going incredibly well.
I' m actually headlining a new revival of Jesus Christ Superstar.
Yeah.
Well, it was really good seeing you guys.
Okay.
All right.
- Be good.
- Bye.
More wine?
Polly Prince.
It' s funny, huh?
Are you okay?
Great.
She looks good.
Let it rain!
So I did a lot of thinking last night, and there' s something I' m pretty excited about.
What' s up?
Nice.
Let it rain!
I feel like I might be ready to move on.
You know, get my life back on track.
So, I am going to ask Polly Prince on a date.
Oh, that' s a mistake!
She' s not right for you, dude.
Rain dance!
Hey, you guys want to play some twos?
Actually, we' re kind of in the middle of a conversation, so...
You douche bags bring your "A" game?
What was that?
I' m just messing with you, sasquatch.
Let' s get it on.
Pick and roll!
Outlet!
Rain dance!
Sandy, come on.
Sandy!
White chocolate!
Raindrop!
Old school!
I' m burning.
My lungs are burning.
Time- out.
[Panting]
You don' t even know this girl, Reuben.
You haven' t seen her since seventh grade.
How different could she be?
She was a "mathlete."
Her yearbook stats are really impressive.
Yeah.
So what?
Ball in!
I really feel like I ran into Polly for a reason.
I mean, I' m sorry if you don' t agree, Sandy, but I happen to believe in a little thing called destiny.
You guys ready?
You think maybe you could put your shirt back on?
You guys ready to play?
Good shot.
Could I have the ball?
Could we switch?
I' d rather not, dude.
I just found out how to cover this man right here, okay?
Come on, let' s play.
Yes, can I get the number for a Polly Prince, please?
Prince with a "P."
Okay, great.
And can I get the address as well?
[Polly]
- Oh, shit!
This is Reuben.
I am unable to get to the phone right now, No!
But please leave a detailed message after the beep.
If you' re calling for...
Gladys, I got to call you back.
I didn' t know you lived down here.
Yeah, yeah, I do.
Yeah.
No, I don' t.
I don' t live down here.
Did you call me last night?
Um, no, I don' t think so.
Are you sure?
'Cause I got a hang- up, so I did that star- 69 thingy, and I swore I got your answering machine.
You know, I heard that from a few people.
So maybe, I don' t know, the phone lines got crossed or something.
Oh.
L...
I spent like 200 bucks on this loofah.
And it' s supposed to be like specially made in Sweden or something.
Would you like to go to dinner sometime?
You know, I' m not...
I' m not sure.
Really?
I mean, not that I wouldn' t...
I' d like to.
It' d be great to catch up on stuff and all that.
I got to check my schedule.
Here you go.
Ah!
And on the back I' ve written my home and my cell number, so...
Right on.
And, um, there' s a pager number too.
Reuben Feffer, senior risk assessment "analysist."
Analyst.
Analyst.
Right.
- All right.
- I' il see you.
See you later.
[Fanfare]
Leland Van Lew' s office.
Hey, Deborah.
Ah, right.
The insurance man.
I' m afraid Leland' s in the hospital.
I' m sorry?
Swimming with who?
But don' t worry.
[Phone Ringing]
Gladys!
He' s due in Los Angeles next week.
Could you hang on one second, please?
No worries.
Reuben Feffer.
It' s Polly Prince.
Oh, hey, Polly!
How' s it going?
Good.
I' m just calling to say that, um, I' m free tomorrow night if you want to get together.
Yeah, I would love to get together.
That' d be great.
Should I pick a restaurant or...
You know what?
Okay.
Did you say you were free?
Yeah, no, I' m actually not sure.
Bye.
Hello.
Okay.
Hello.
What' s the buzz Tell me what' s a- happenin '??
What' s the buzz Tell me what' s a- happenin '??
What' s the buzz Tell me what' s a- happenin '??
What' s the buzz Tell me what' s a- happenin '??
What' s the buzz Tell me what' s a- happenin '??
Why should you want to know??
Don' t you mind about the future??
Uh, Sandy??
Save tomorrow for tomorrow?
Think about today instead?
Sandy.!
What?
That' s my song.
I know it' s your song, but I felt something, and I decided to go with it.
Judas.
Here' s the deal.
I' m the star of the show, okay?
So if I decide to bust out a solo, do me a favor and give me the freedom to rock out.
From the top, okay, Wonsuk?
So the play' s going well?
Yeah, I think it' s gonna be fun.
Uh- huh.
Isn' t that like the point of community theater?
Whatever, Reuben.
Where are you taking her?
I don' t know.
Some restaurant in the East Village.
She left the address on my machine.
How could you let Polly pick the restaurant?
Well, I had no choice.
Why?
What' s wrong with letting her pick the place?
You' ve got irritable bowel syndrome, dude.
Oh, my God.
You' re right.
Thank you.
You know, I doubt it' il get this far, but if she turns out to be easier than I thought, there' s something you need to know.
I' m not a virgin, Sandy.
No, not technically, but times have changed since you were last single.
Now, listen, when I' m making out with a girl for the first time,
What?
Nothing violent.
You just tap her real light right on the tushy and say,
I' m your daddy. "
Listen to me.
I' m blotting the grease.
That' s the best part.
Let me see that.
Listen, don' t be shy.
- It' s just a little tap.
It' s like saying, "Boop, I' m your daddy."
- I' m not gonna tap her.
Brings' em right back to childhood.
Trust me, they' re putty in your hands after that.
Really.
[Laughs]
Yeah, I actually think it' s not gonna work out, but I' m pulling for you, Reub.
Just pray to God she doesn' t go ethnic.
The place didn' t sound ethnic.
Al Hafez.??
[Middle Eastern]
In the late '90s.
Oh, yeah?
Like where?
Oh, God, where?
Let' s see, Austin, Istanbul, Sri Lanka, Portland,
Wow.
Were you in the Peace Corps?
No, I just like to move a lot.
I kinda get stir- crazy if I' m stuck in one place for too long, you know what I mean?
- Oh, yeah, completely.
Oh, my God!
I can' t believe you remember that.
Oh, of course.
You were like the greatest delegate in Model U. N. History.
I guess I did manage to pass a few resolutions.
Are you okay?
'Cause you' re sweating pretty profusely.
Yeah, no, I' m fine.
Okay.
Yeah, but I love it.
I can' t believe you' re not married.
I always saw you as that guy that would settle down at a young age, you know?
You were always kinda like an old young guy.
[Stomach Growling]
But, uh, what about you?
You ever gotten close or...
To the whole marriage thing?
Oh, God, no.
No way.
No, yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Why?
Are you coming out of a bad relationship or...
No, I' m kinda coming out of like eight bad relationships.
- Eight?
I' m good.
But if the right person came along, things might be different, right?
Oh, yeah.
You' re probably right.
Sorry.
Sure.
Oh, gosh!
Occupied.
I' m gonna be here all night, dude.
All right, well, this is me.
Great.
Okay, great.
I just gotta find my keys here.
Oh, shoot.
- They' re right there, I hear 'em.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, wow.
Thanks.
Did you just move in or...
Uh- huh.
Rat!
Rat in the house!
He' s a ferret.
I got him in Sicily at a flea market years ago.
He can' t really see anymore.
Cute.
Oh, sure, yeah.
Oh, actually, that' s not the bathroom.
- My bathroom' s right here.
I' il just be a second.
[Door Closes]
[Small Fart]
- [Squeaks]
Oh, no.
If you make this water go down,
I will sit at your feet, and I will serve you for all of eternity.
- No!
Oh, my God.!
This was fun.
If I' d known your grandmother had embroidered that towel,
Oh, really, you know what, that' s okay.
Okay, well...
Good night, Reuben.
Oh, okay.
All right, okay.
All right.
Dude, why would you make number two in her apartment?
She asked me to come upstairs.
[Woman Singing]
Guys.
I called her to apologize.
What was that?
I called her to apologize.
But it doesn' t really matter 'cause I doubt she' il ever want to see me again.
You know what?
Cool.
[Elevator Dings]
Yes.
Hi.
Reuben Feffer.
I recognized you from the Forbes cover.
You' re way early, sport.
Get in.
Yeah.
I don' t think we' il have a problem with this insurance business.
Sure, I take chances, but, hey, you can' t build a successful business without the occasional risk.
Oh, of course.
What I' m trying to determine are the kinds of risks you actually do take.
I only take the calculated ones.
Trust me, I plan on being round for ages yet.
Well, I know we' d really love to give you a policy if we can make it work.
We' il make it work, sport.
Great.
So, uh, what are we doing on the roof?
I' m just gonna do a bit of a BASE jump.
Keep the walkie on channel 13, all right?
I don' t know what you' re talking about.
A free- fall from an inanimate object.
Oh, no.
[Cell Phone Ringing]
All right, look, just don' t do anything, all right?
Hey, Polly!
How' s it going?
No, that' s not all right.
Polly, can I call you back in a second?
I just wanted to tell you I got your message, and you know what?
Let' s just start over and forget about that whole loofah thing.
No.!
Yahoo!
Holy shit!
- [Screams]
Leland' s meeting with the insurance guy right now.
- Oh, crap!
Oh, shit!
Bye!
Leland to Feffer, Leland to Feffer.
You there, mate?
Yes, Feffer to Leland, hello?
Come on down and give us a hand.
I think I might have fractured me coccyx.??
Oh, look at that.
You got me a new loofah.
Yeah, it' s from Finland, and the salesman said it has a very ergonomic design, so...
Oh, Reuben, that' s really... thank you... really sweet.
[Laughs]
I don' t believe this!
Oh, what are you doing here?
We' re having an early supper.
Really?
It' s only 3: 00.
It' s a crime to beat the dinner crowds?
Who is this young woman?
This is Polly Prince.
Irving and Vivian Feffer.
Polly, it' s so good meeting you.
- How are you?
- I can' t believe you' re eating Indian.
You hate spicy food.
- [No Audible Dialogue]
I' m gonna ask...
It' s okay.
Need big table, please.
Four people.
Many thanks.
Okay.
Now, how do you kids know each other?
Mom, we went to middle school together.
We were both delegates in the Model U. N.
Oh, you still work in government, honey?
I' m a waitress.
- She' s also writing a children' s book.
Oh, very nice.
Reu, you' il never guess who I ran into yesterday.
Who' s that?
Lisa' s mother.
That' s good.
What is this stuff called?
- Sag.
- Sag.
Did you try this?
Apparently, Lisa' s doing wonderfully down there in St. Barts,
- selling villas, happy.
- That' s good for her.
- Now, who' s Lisa?
- Not important.
Oh.
- Are we ready for the check?
I think I' il take the check.
- [Sighs]
- What?
Well, you know, your dad seems really nice.
[Chuckles]
I just, um...
I guess' cause I hadn' t seen you for so long and...
Oh, it' s so okay.
I understand.
No, I was an idiot.
I should' ve just told you the truth right from the start.
Reuben, I' m really...
But when did this happen?
Two weeks ago.
Two weeks ago?
Oh, my God!
Are you okay?
Well, it was a pretty big shock.
I walked in on her, on Lisa, with, um, a scuba instructor on the first day of our honeymoon.
Anyway...
I mean...
Uh, it' s Polly...
Prince.
Um, I don' t know if you have any plans tonight, but if not, you should swing by, uh, 37 Gansevort Street... around 9: 00 if you can make it.
You know, it' s no big deal, but it could be fun.
So, you know, think about it.
Okay, so, um, I' il see you later... or not.
I mean either way.
Oh, if you do come, you should wear comfortable shoes.
But you totally don' t have to.
I mean, I might not even be there.
Yeah.
I wore my comfortable shoes just like you said.
So what are we doing?
Oh, crap.
This place is a total secret.
It is the best underground salsa club in New York.
Yeah, you know, I' m not really a big dancer.
You know what?
Just feel it in your legs.
All right.
Okay.
Sorry, sorry.
Just step on my feet a little less than that.
Work it?
Looking good, Pollyanna.
- Hey, Javi.
You stop that.
This is my friend Reuben.
- This is Javi.
Hey, you mind if I dance with the beautiful lady?
Yeah.
- All right, thanks, man.
Really?
Yeah.
Are you having a bad time?
I' m just not into this whole dirty dancing thing.
What do you mean, dirty dancing?
I saw that movie.
Whoa.
Wait a minute.
First of all, he' s Cuban, and that wasn' t dirty dancing, that was just salsa.
Okay, it' s just I' m just really, truthfully not the kind of guy... that' s ever gonna be into these kind of clubs or any...
Okay, Reuben, you know, then tell me, what kind of guy are ya?
What kind of guy am I?
What do you mean?
Well, up until now, you haven' t exactly been the portrait of honesty, so just come clean, okay?
Just tell me who you are.
I hate spicy food.
I knew it!
Yeah, I don' t like it at all.
I have a mild case of I. B. S. And...
What is that?
What?
Irritable bowel syndrome.
That' s terrible.
Um, what else?
Look, the thing is,
I assess risk for a living, so I know that I have a. 013% chance... of being hit by a car on my way home, or a one in 46, 000 chance of falling through a subway grate.
Really?
So I try to manage that risk by avoiding danger... and having a plan and knowing what my next move is, and I guess you don' t exactly live your life that way.
I do it a little differently.
But I' m not gonna ever be a dirty dancer, and I don' t eat food with my hands, and I really like you, but I just don' t think this is gonna work out.
I just have to go pee.
Okay.
Just kidding.!
Funny.
- Hi.?
Did you just spank me?
No!
No.
'Cause it felt like you just swatted me.
I have a little crick in my wrist.
You just felt that little...
Do you hear that?
Really?
You hear that?
Well, I got it out.
[Reuben Thinking]
Oh, wow.
Oh, man.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, no!
You can' t be done yet.
Come on, Reuben, focus.
You have to last at least five minutes here.
Four minutes, 27, 26, 25.
Two minutes 20, 19, 18, 17.
You can do it.
Oh, God!
Fifty!
[Giggles]
Fifty?
Let it rain.!
I tell ya, I think I might end up marrying this woman.
Really?
After one night?
Did you spank her?
Yeah, I tried, but I don' t think she liked it.
Yeah, some women find it offensive.
Iceman!
I did not sleep with him out of charity.
You weren' t interested till you found out his wife boned some other guy on their honeymoon.
That' s not it.
He is a kind, decent, solid guy.
I' ve never been with anybody like that.
Thank you.
Do you have to use the word "bone" every time?
I use it when it' s appropriate.
Yeah.
Okay, so throw pillows go in this cabinet here.
Oh, you don' t... you don' t sleep on these?
No, no, they' re... decorative.
- For who?
- What do you mean?
You' re the only one who sees them, but you don' t sleep on them.
Then you take them off the bed every night, put 'em in a box, take them out of the box.
I just don' t understand the point.
I don' t know.
I mean, Lisa thought they looked nice.
I see.
I don' t see what the big deal is.
They make the bed look nice.
What are you doing?
That' s goose down!
I' m liberating you.
No!
I' m not gonna...
Come on.
Come on!
This is ridiculous.
It' s not ridiculous.
It' s not like driving a knife into a pillow is suddenly gonna make me feel...
That feels really good.
[Chuckles]
- You know what?
You' re right.
Bigger one.
No point.
They' re stupid.
Ha!
Not anymore.
You know how many minutes a day...
I spend getting throw pillows on and off the bed?
How many?
That' s eight minutes of my life.
I figured it out.
Ha!
[Yelling]
- Wait, wait, wait.
I really gotta go.
I' m late.
[Reuben]
You lose your keys again?
No, they' re just not where I left them before.
Hey, why don' t you use that key finder I bought you?
Reuben, I don' t...
Need the stupid key finder!
All right.
Anyway, I was thinking I' d come meet you.
[Beeping]
No, it' s just salsa.
I' il watch.
Hey, what' s that noise?
Nothing.
No, it' s so not the key finder.
Yes, it is!
I' il see you later.
Bye.
Yes, it...
How???
Yeah.
Doin 'all right.
Actually, me no estás too good, Javier.
I want you to stay away from Polly, all right?
Find yourself another dance partner.
- Why?
Because she and I are a couple, all right?
Yeah, we' re dating.
And I' m not gonna let some big shot salsa king... sweep in with your mambo moves and your Erik Estrada look... and come in and try to take her away, because I' ve had that happen before and it' s not gonna happen again.
- Reuben, I am gay.
What?
I' m homosexual.
Oh.
Hey, you think maybe you could give me some salsa lessons???
You hated it.
No, I don' t.
It' s just...
It' s very graphic for a children' s book.
You know, like this one:
"The Boy with a Nub for an Arm."
Well, that one has a moral.
You know, to teach kids they gotta be careful when they' re playing with fireworks.
Seriously.
I mean, like, you really convey... the pain and the fear, and I love the little doggy too.
And I don' t mean this in a bad way.
Right.
Just what were you thinking?
Which helps me finalize my recommendations.
BASE jumping.!
That is supposed to be so much fun.
That should be on the rewards side.
It' s one of the most dangerous activities a human being can do.
Really?
Have you done it?
No.
No?
So how do you know what it' s like?
I don' t.
Interesting.
Sure.
Yeah, thanks.
I actually like this.
Yeah, it' s good.
Now you look like a pro racquetballer.
How' s that shirt fit, all right?
Uh, yeah, it' s fine.
You know, I was thinking maybe we can just sit and talk.
No worries.
We' il just get up a bit of a sweat.
Have a few giggles.
So I' ve been running the numbers, and I gotta say... things aren' t looking too good from our end.
Bollocks!
Leland, I mean, it' s not just the BASE jumping.
Volcano luging, shark diving.
Bottom line is, unless you drastically alter your lifestyle, we won' t be able to insure you.
Reuben, I came to you for a reason.
I was told that you had more imagination... than any of the other blokes in the big firms... that you analyze the man and not just the numbers.
I guess I was wrong.
Are you trying to manipulate me?
Of course I am.
But I wanna hold onto me company.
- I' il tell you what.
I' m gonna be in Nantucket at the end of the month.
You' il come up and be my guest aboard the 'Roo Shooter.
Aboard the what?
My sailboat.
I' il take you for a bit of a sail, give you a chance to really get to know me.
And I guarantee you by the end of the weekend, you' il know what a safe bet I really am.
Uh, you' re bleeding pretty bad.
Yeah, I think I' ve swallowed a tooth or something.
No.
Got it.
Your serve.??
So I tell Leland we can' t insure him.
He responds by inviting me up to Nantucket for some Death Ray Sailing Challenge.
Yeah.
I' ve never been to Nantucket.
Well, can...
Is it all right if I invite myself?
That' d be great.
So you' re actually gonna commit to something in advance.
Yeah...
Oh, my God.
I think that would be really fun.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doin '?
No.
Everybody knows that.
What are you talking about?
Okay?
Dirty...
Why are their hands dirty?
[Gasps]
Yeah, so when you think you' re innocently eating a little bar snack, you' re actually ingesting potentially deadly bacteria from about 39 soil- handed strangers.
I mean, people wonder why they get E. Coli poisoning or salmonella or hepatitis, when all they gotta do is look at the snack bowl at their local watering hole.
No.
It' s an absolute hot zone in there.
How could you have eaten those?
L- l- l- I mean, I made such a compelling argument.
Oh.
Yeah.
You never know.
Reuben, I mean, you don' t have to do this.
I don' t care that you... that you don' t know how to dance.
No, I thought I' d give it one last try.
Hey, Javi.
Hey, Reuben.
You ready?
- [Polly]
- What are you doing?
I don' t even know where that "yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi" thing came from.
It was just awesome.
Holy shit.!
What are you doing here?
I' m back.
Who' s this?
Who' s this?
This is my girlfriend.
What?
- I' m not your girlfriend.
I mean, we' rejust kind of...
Lisa.
[Polly]
No, no, no, no, no.
I don' t want you to go.
I wanna go.
I don' t...
I don' t want you to go.
You gotta talk about it.
I' m just gonna go.
I don' t understand.
I thought you were really happy with Claude.
- Really?
- I missed you.
Reuben...
What was I supposed to do?
I moved on.
I' m in a relationship.
- What, with that Polly person?
- Yeah.
She doesn' t even call herself your girlfriend.
No.
Then let mejust ask you this.
Are you really gonna spend the rest of your life with her?
I don' t know, Lisa.
Because I' m ready to do that with you, Reuben.
I made a mistake and I took you for granted, but I promise you that I will never, ever hurt you again.
I love you, Reuben.
You know what?
I think you should, um, go stay with your parents, okay,
'cause I gotta be out of here in a week.
What are you talking about?
I' m going into the house, remember?
Let' s go move into our house.
I can' t...
No.
I can' t...
I don' t even know what to say right now, okay?
Okay.
If you wanna get back together with her, just let me know.
I wouldn' t be seeing you if I was planning...
You guys are married.
All right, Polly...
How' s it coming with Herb Lazare, D. D. S.?
I' m- I' m still working on Van Lew.
I thought you decided on Van Lew two weeks ago.
We' re presenting to AFLAC on Wednesday.
Polly, can you hang on a second?
No, I kinda have to go.
You better not be bonus hunting on me, Reuben.
Bonus hunting?
Stan, the man' s career is on the line.
I owe it to him to give him a thorough analysis.
All right.
I' m going to Barbados with my mistress for the weekend.
All right?
I am on it, and I' m gonna make it happen.
Good things.
[Doorbell Rings]
Hey, pal.
Hey, Larry.
Lisa dropped this off for you.
Thanks.
I met a real estate agent named Lisa Kramer... who showed me an apartment, which I rentedjust so she' d go out with me.
I gave him a good price.
Yeah, not good enough.
She' s a killer.!
[Rock]?
Hey, hey, hey, hey?
Can we please just focus for a second?
I' m almost finished.
What' s next?
Polly' s career prospects.
Risky.
She' s writing a children' s book where kids get maimed.
Yeah, see, I think her lack of career is actually a positive,
'cause she' d have more time to spend with the kids.
Why are we even doing this?
Because I' m confused, Sandy.
I mean, my goddamn wife shows up on my doorstep... wanting to get back together, Polly' s freaking out.
I just wanna make sure I' m making the right decision.
I don' t see how putting these two girls in the Riskmaster' s gonna help you make up your mind.
Interesting.
What' s it say?
Polly.
Polly?
Yeah.
No way.
You should just cut your losses and get back with Lisa.
Nah, I checked it, like, three times.
The program says she' s the safer choice.
Whatever.
By the way, dude, is your health okay?
I mean, you' re looking kind of thin.
Polly' s been making me eat ethnic food, so I' ve been throwing up a lot lately.
Cool.
Polly Prince.
Polly Feffer.
Polly Prince- Feffer.
You can' t cancel.
I thought you were so excited to go.
I know, but...
Hello?
- Hold on.
- So we had our designer use a similar color palette in here.
I' m on the phone.
It' s like I feel weird going away for the weekend when your wife' s just come back into town.
I don' t know why you' re making this into such a big deal.
I told you I' m not getting back together with her.
So are you coming or not?
I' m coming.
All right.
Okay?
Bye.
You' re pretty good at it.
[Polly]
This is amazing.!
Are those storm clouds up ahead?
We might just get a light dusting, that' s all.
Nothing to write home about.
Are you sure you' re all right?
[Reuben]
I don' t think I have my sea legs yet.
I' il be out in a sec.
All right.
Oh, God.??
So I know we haven' t been seeing each other that long, but I really feel like it' s time we take things to the next level, and I' d like you to consider moving in with me.
Why don' t we just...
Why don' t we just move in together?
We' re gonna have ourselves a tussle.
Rodolfo' s in your toiletry kit.!
Did you pack him, or did you... did you...
What- What is this?
I mean, why am I in your computer... on your Riskmaster thingy and...
I can explain this, Polly.
I learned a lot about myself.
I' ve learned that I have no career, I' m flaky, I like ethnic food.
Polly, would you let me explain this?
Lisa came back, and I, you know, I' ve been trying to figure things out.
What are you figuring out, Reuben?
Just about us and our future.
Future?
What future?
Reuben, come on!
Come on.
What, did you think we were gonna get married?
Whoa!
Maybe...
I was gonna ask you to move in with me first.
You expect me to move to the suburbs with you?
Reuben, are you insane?
People do that all the time.
You know what, though?
You do that, right?
I don' t live my life that way.
I don' t...
Yes, you do!
You' re on the non- plan plan.
I am not on a non- plan plan!
You are too!
I' ve never met anybody more afraid of committing to anything.
I mean, you were a senior delegate at the Model U. N., Polly.
What the hell happened to you?
You can do better than that!
I' ve been living my life, okay?
I' ve been in good relationships and I' ve been in shitty ones, and I' ve moved a lot, and I' ve been happy and I' ve been sad, and I' ve been lonely, and that' s what I' ve been doing, which is a lot more than I can say for some freak who thinks... he' s gonna get the Ebola virus from a bowl of mixed nuts.
Those nuts have pee on them!
It' s common sense!
Oh, trust me, that is so far beyond common sense, Reuben.
You don' t understand what I grew up with.
I had a mother who made me afraid of everything.
My dad had a whole second family.
- What?
- Yeah, on Long Island.
A wife and kids and a golden retriever.
A second family?
Hey, you know what?
Polly...
I' m gonna make this really, uh, easy for you, Reuben.
I have no interest... in getting married and moving to the suburbs.
And, obviously, that' s something that' s really important to you.
So here' s what I think your new plan should be.
I think you should get back together with Lisa, move into your house, and move on with your life.
And- And, uh, I think you guys will be really happy together.
Oh, dear Lord.
You' re not making myjob any easier, Leland.
Weather report said sunny skies.
[Polly On Answering Machine]
Hey, it' s Polly...
Leave me a message, or call back, or not.
[Beeps]
Hey, Polly, it' s me.
'Cause I feel really bad about what happened, and...
Just give me a call on my cell phone, all right?
?
Baby, you' re a lost?
Baby, you' re a lost cause?
Hi.
So, how' s the house?
The house is, uh... it' s great.
Yeah, it' s big, but, you know, great.
Well, I can' t wait to see it.
Hey, did you get the gift I sent you?
Thanks.
I really wanna see you, Reuben.
I don' t know, Lisa.
Fighting for a lost cause??
Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats.
The premiere ofJesus Christ Superstar is about to begin.
Reuby Tuesday.!
¿Cómo estás?
What are you doin 'here?
Ah.
I didn' t figure you a fan of musical theater.
No, my friend Sandy Lyle is in the show.
Hey, have you, um... have you talked to Polly?
She was upset, bro.
Must' ve been some kind of fight, huh?
I keep calling her up, and she won' t pick up the phone.
I don' t know, I was thinking about maybe dropping by tomorrow.
It' s a bit too late, papi.
She' s leaving town in about two hours.
W- Why?
Where is she going?
I don' t know.
She said good- bye.
Hi.
Oh, no.
Yeah.
Hey, Javi, this is Lisa, my... wife.
Her mother told me she was back.
You' re doing the right thing here, Reub.
I' m not promising anything.
It' s very exciting.
Reuben, Stan.
Change of plan.
The meeting with Van Lew' s board and the AFLAC people' s moved to 4: 00.
4: 00?
I don' t know if I can do that.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Get your ass over here!
Good evening, folks.
Uh, I' m Sandy Lyle, and I' ve got a very special announcement.
In addition to playing the role ofJudas,
[Man]
Sandy, what are you doing?
Wonsuk is playing Jesus.
I' m playing dual roles.
Give me your crown, okay, Wonsuk?
You' re a has- been.
No one even cares you were in that stupid movie.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, shit!
Judas is biting me.!
What just happened in there?
I am a professional, Reuben, and I' m not gonna put my reputation on the line for a group of freaking amateurs.
It' s always the same story with you, huh, pal?
You did this one movie a hundred years ago.
From then on, you thought you were better than everybody else.
Move on with your life.
It' s not about what happened in the past... or what you think might happen in the future.
It' s about the ride, for Christ' s sake.
There' s no point going through all this crap... if you' re not gonna enjoy the ride.
And you know what?
When you least expect it, something great might come along... something better than you even planned for.
You were funny as hell playing those bagpipes, though.
Did I ever tell you that?
L- I don' t think I' ve ever heard you speak before, Mr. Feffer.
So, Reuby, we' re gonna grab a bite after your work thingamajigy?
No, Lisa.
I shouldn' t have asked you to come down here.
I' m not getting back together with you.
What are you talking about?
Why?
You screwed a scuba diving instructor on our honeymoon.
I mean, what kind of cold, heartless bitch... would do that to someone they love?
I' d have to be an idiot to get back together with you after that.
Oh, and by the way, I destroyed all your little throw pillows.
Yeah, because throw pillows suck, okay?
They serve no purpose.
They' re purely decorative.
Dude, that was incredible.
Reuben.
Whatever you do, don' t ever take my advice again.
Your dad totally put it in perspective for me.
I was barely famous back then, and I' m never gonna be famous again.
The E!
Channel doesn' t even know we' re making this show.
What do you mean?
I hired Dustin and Vic myself.
And I was gonna try and sell it to the network when I' m done.
True Hollywood Story on yourself?
That' s the stupidest thing I' ve ever heard.
I know.
I' m such a loser.
So you gotta promise me just this one time you won' t screw it up.
Reuben, I' m your wingman.
Whatever it is, I will not let you down.
Your Reuben' s proxy?
What the hell does that mean?
Now, he' s dealing with a personal situation, so he asked me to fill in.
Now, you gotta relax.
I' m a professional actor, and these dudes will never know the difference.
I can' t freaking believe this is happening.
Be quiet, 'cause I' m... tryin' to prepare.
I' m gonna vomit.
I am so sorry for the delay, folks, but one of our senior analysts, Reuben Feffer, had his spleen burst just a few moments ago, and...
Is he gonna be all right?
Well, God willing, Leland.
But anyway, be that as it may, we have Mr. Feffer' s associate here, Mr. Sanford Lyle, who' s been briefed on the case and will present Reuben' s recommendations.
Thank you, Stanley.
I just need a little bit of water.
As you know, this is a highly complex case.
Um, let me see here.
Leland' s blood pressure is pretty solid.
And he' s, uh, at a decent weight, and he looks pretty damn healthy, right?
And he' s a sexy guy, right?
And he is sexually active in the community.
- Polly?
- J. F. K., please.
Let' s not bullcrap each other.
On paper, Van Lew is one of the riskiest sons ofbitches alive.
But, people, we cannot sum up a man' s life with a bunch of numbers on a computer screen.
All right, we all need to look into our hearts and go,
"Do I think this dude is gonna die in a few years or not?"
Is old Leland here gonna fight off a man... with the last name "Reaper," first name... who goes by the last name "Reaper," first name "Grim"?
Or will this BASE- jumping, crocodile- wrestling, shark- diving, volcano- luging, bear- fighting, snake- wrangling, motocross- racing bastard die?
And the answer is no, friends, which is why myself,
Reuben Feffer, Stan... and all of us here at Indurby and Friends... are willing to lay our asses on the line... and proudly recommend that Leland Van Lew... receive fifty million dollars in life and health... and automobile insurance... for a duration of no less than 20 years.
Hey, what do you think, guys?
Are you that kid from Crocodile Tears?
You' re goddamn right I am.
I thought so.
Impressive presentation.
He' s insured.
Bloody ripper!
Congratulations.
Love ya, son.!
Rodolfo, wait.!
[Beeping Intensifies]
Reuben, it' s too late.
I have to be on a plane in, like, 45 minutes.
I don' t think you really wanna leave here.
You have no idea what I want.
You left Rodolfo behind.
Does that mean anything to you?
I should' ve never put you in the Riskmaster.
Truth is, no matter what happened on our honeymoon, you' re much riskier than Lisa could ever be.
Yes.
That' s why it' s not gonna work out between us.
Reuben, you are a nice, safe, conventional guy.
It' s not gonna work out.
I don' t think that' s who I really am.
That' s okay.
What do I have to do to prove it to you?
What are you...
Hey, look.
Look, I' m eating nuts.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Those nuts aren' t even dirty.
Since we' ve been together, I' ve felt more uncomfortable, out of place, embarrassed... and just physically sick than I have in my entire life.
I couldn' t have thrown up 19 times in 48 days... if I wasn' t in love with you.
Maybe this is just a fling.
But if you get on that plane and you go to Cincinnati... or Tanzania or wherever you' re going, we' il never know if it could' ve been something more.
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
- Please don' t eat those.
No, really.
I don' t want you to go away, Polly.
I' m not gonna marry you, Reuben.
I don' t wanna get married.
I just wanna take you to dinner... sometime this week.
Can I pick the place?
Solid.
Hi.
Hello.
I see you two are new to the island.
I want to come have a meet...
Leuban!
I cannot believe it is you.
This is Polly.
Hi, Polly.
I am Claude.
Hi.
So how' s it goin '?
In truth, uh, it has been a little bit tough noogies for me.
Lisa, she... she broke my heart.
- I' m sorry to hear that.
That is life, huh?
Well, you have to be like the hippo.
Exactly.
Like the hippo.
You are here on honeymoon again?
This is your beautiful bride?
We' re just hangin 'out.
Oh, come on.
Well, yeah.
I' m just sayin 'we' re not married.
- No, definitely not married.
- It is possible.
We' re takin' things step by step, seein' how they work out.
Okay, I don' t really understand what you are talking about, but, uh, any chance you are for scuba today?
Actually, we are for scuba.
- No way, Jose!
- Yes way, Jose!
But we' re goin 'out with that guy.
Hey, Leland.!
We' il be out there in a minute.!
As long as you are for scuba, Leuban, I am happy.
Sweet.
So, au revoir, my good friend.
Thank you for everything, Claude.
It' s good to see you again.
Good- bye, Polly.
Nice to meet you, Claude.
You as well.
So you ready?
But you can' t seem to get enough??
The earth
Is in a blaze
The world
Is in a maze
The way
Of life today
Is strange and odd
What happened
Across the sea
May come
To you and me
Whoa, come
Let us go back
To God
Go back
- To God - Oh, come on
Let' s go back to God
- Come on - Let' s go back to God
- It' s mighty hard - Let' s go back to God
- Whoa, yeah - Let' s go back to God
- Left his mark - Let' s go back to God
- Come on, yes - Let' s go back to God
- Let us go back - Let' s go back to God
- Go back to God - Come, let us go back
Uh!

- What?
- And he been playing that music,
- Well, if you want, you know, I could...

And Othar don' t like that music neither,
- It' s been disturbin 'Othar then, has it?
"Left My Wallet in El Segundo"!
And, Sheriff, do you know what they call colored folks in them songs?
Have you got any idea?

- Let us go back - Let' s go back
- To God - Go back to God
Do you need somethin 'to eat, angel?
Othar, I went and complained about Weemack today,
Don' t know if it' il do any good,
That boy hangin 'by a thread, Over the pit,
Fiery pit!
"Left My Wallet in El Segundo,"
Ooh!
67 years of life, 46 years of marriage,
You mean to tell me you never once suffered from piles?
Well, it' s the human condition,
Most humans, anyhow,
"Them that' s got the piles and them that' s goin 'get' em,"
But you always was healthy as a ox,
Passed on 'fore you could get the piles, Mm- hm,
Ooh, thank the Lord you never was sick,
I just want to pass away nice and peaceful,
Whoo!
Pickles!
- Go fetch Pickles!
- Pickles?
Oh, he' s up that tree again!
You' d better shimmy on up,
Well, I do apologize, madam, but... won' t the feline eventually tire of his lonely perch and, pining for his master' s affection, return on his own initiative?
Uh, the point being, must we actually ascend the tree?
Look, I don' t want no doubletalk,
Now, if you not gon 'fetch him, I guess I gotta call the police,
- Police?
- And they not goin 'be happy,
Every time they have to fetch him, they swear they' il never do it no more,
No need to call the authorities, madam,
I did this often as a child,
I was a positive lemur, Here, kitty!
- Oh, don' t upset him now!
- I wouldn' t think of it, madam,
Harmless little Felix domesticus,
Here, Kitty, Come to G, H,
Come, come, Here, kitty, Here, kitty,
Come, come, come, No, no, no,
That' s not how Sheriff Wyner do it,
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Come, come, come,
Come to the professor,
Yes, Y...
Ah!
Uh... thank you, madam, for your act of kindness,
- Well, you let him out, - I certainly did, and for that I apologize no end,
Allow me to present myself, um, formally,
Goldthwait Higginson Dorr, Ph, D,
Like Elmer?
- I beg your pardon, ma' am?
- Fudd,
No, no, Ph, D, is a mark of academic attainment bestowed, in my case, in recognition of my mastery of the antique languages of Latin and Greek,
I also hold a number of other advanced degrees, including the baccalaureate from a school in Paris, France, called the Sorbonne,
Sore bone, Well, that fits,
You ever study at Bob Jones University?
I have not had that privilege,
Oh, that' s a Bible school, Only the finest in the country,
- I send 'em $5 every month, - That is very generous...
- I' m on the mailin 'list!
I' m a Angel, - Are you?
Yes,
Oh, they list my name in the newsletter every issue,
- Do they?
- Oh, I got the literature right over here,
- if you' d like to examine it...
- Perhaps when my head has recovered from its, uh... uh, buffeting,
Mrs, Munson, are you at all curious as to why I darkened your door, as the expression would have it, on this lovely, lovely camellia- scented morn?
Well, I was wonderin 'till you let Pickles out,
- I quite understand, - Then in all the excitement...
The fact is, I saw the sign in your window advertising a room to let?
And there are no other such signs among the houses
- on this charming, charming street, - Yeah, I got a room, $15 a week, I' m lookin 'for a quiet tenant,
Madam, you are addressing a man who is quiet and yet not quiet, If I may offer a riddle,
I am currently on sabbatical from the institution where I teach, the University of Mississippi at Hattiesburg,
I am takin 'a year off to indulge my passion, and I do not believe that is too strong a word,
- for the music of the Renaissance, - Mm- hm,
I perform in, and have the honor of directing, a period- instrument ensemble that performs at Renaissance Fairs and other cultural fora throughout central and southern Mississippi,
We perform on the instruments for which the music was originally composed,
Now, wait a minute, You got some kind of band?
Oh, no, The word "band" would be, in this context, something of a misnomer,
Though we do play together, hence the word "ensemble", the nature of the music is such that, well, one would hesitate to apply the epithet "band"
- with connotations of janglin 'rhythms, - So y' all ain' t playin' no hippity- hop?
"I Left My Wallet in El Segundo", Songs with the titles spelled all funny?
Oh, no, no, We play music that has been composed to the greater glory of God,
Devotional music, Church music,
Gospel music?
Well, inspired by the gospel, certainly,
The vintage, of course, is no more recent than the Rococo,
Rococo, huh?
Well, I guess that' d be OK,
But I don' t propose to inflict our rehearsals on you,
May I inquire, do you have a root cellar?
Yes,
Yes, yes,
This looks promising,
A little dank, ain' t it?
Marvelous,
Oh, these earthen walls are ideal for baffling the higher registers of the, uh...
lute or sackbut,
That is why so much music of the cinquecento was played in crypts and catacombs, This is ideal, This is perfect, This is more than perfect,
- I can scarcely contain my glee, - Oh, you containin 'it OK,
You gotta peel this shit out, man, Sometimes it stick to the bottom,
Hey, this shit smells like piles,
You wouldn' t even believe this, man, Even out here on the casino floor you gonna find goddamn mercy pads, Tucks...
I don' t know what the fuck people be doin 'here while they gamblin',
Man, I ain' t peelin 'no funky shit with my human hands,
- and shit attackin 'your fuckin' insides, - Oh, well, shit, you gotta do it,
'cause Mr, Gudge checks everything,
This tunnel leads back onto the land for all the people that work for Mannex,
Mannex Corporation, They own the Bandit Queen, three other boats,
Now, this is where they think on their corporate shit, Gudge and them,
I mean, the light' s as ugly as all hell, but, shit, ain' t as many Tucks,
- Let me in, motherfucker!
- What' s the password?
Kiss my ass!
Now, this is where they count the dough, Now, if you try to take any of it,
Elron over there' il shoot yo 'ass, Goddamn!
Dawg, this is a motherfuckin 'pigsty, man!
You are a squeakyass, motherfuckin 'pig!
Man, look at your ass, You got Cocoa Krispies on your uniform,
Got breakfast there, and you still eatin 'goddamn lunch, man,
I swear to God, if that ass was nickels, you' d be a motherfuckin 'millionaire,
Spread out, boy, Look at you, You a disgraceful fucka!
You is a fat motherfucker, man!
I swear...
Hey, Mr, Gudge, uh...
- How you doin 'this mornin'?
- I' m doin 'fine,
- All right, - So, how' s the new man?
Oh, shit, he a cleanin 'motherfucker, man,
- Is that a fact?
- What' s up, my nigga?
Cut!
Cut, cut, cut!
Goddamn it, his canteen fell off, Props!
- The goddamn thing' s canteen fell off, - OK, We' re prepared for that,
Mountain, put Otto into the apparatus,
- What the hell is this?
- World War I vintage gas mask,
It' s authentic, Strapped on, of course, so it can' t fall off,
Now, the animal is free to be as active as he wants,
It doesn' t inhibit his movement in any way, and......
I think it really sells the whole doughboy thing,
- It looks like a fucking joke, - Uh, you' re absolutely right,
The gas mask is a whimsical concept,
How the hell does it eat when it gets to the Nibbles Ready- to- Eat?
- Well, you' re absolutely right, - Don' t let the clients see this,
- Or that Humane fucker, - No, of course not,
They' il just shut the fuckin 'spot down, Pancake, They' il shut...... shut the fuckin' spot down, OK?
Put the goddamn canteen back on the dog, That says he' s a soldier!
Dented tin canteen, All right?
Strap it to his fucking collar!
Easiest thing in the world, I- I just thought...
What?... but you' re right, A canteen' s much better, Good concept, Let' s go with that,
- What' s he doing?
- Well, he' s, uh...
- Just breathe normally, Otto, - The fucking dog can' t breathe,
Oh, no, he can breathe, Eh, eh, that thing is...
- Just breathe normally, Otto, - The fuckin 'dog can' t breathe,
The fuckin 'dog cannot breathe!
Get the fu...
Get that fuckin 'thing off of him,
Of course, Easiest thing in the world,
Chitra!
Make sure that Humane fucker doesn' t come over here, OK?
Distract him, He' il shit if he sees this,
There we go, Mountain, have electric run me a stinger,
Don' t give up on me, Otto!
Mountain, I need two live leads!
Uh, eh, but, Garth, the gennie' s a hundred yards away,
Goddamn it, Otto' s gonna have irreversible brain damage in about 30 seconds,
Here we go, OK, kiss of life,
Otto is fuckin 'dead!
What the fuck are you doing?!
Otto is fuckin 'dead!
320!
320!
Ugh!
L- left, 90- tiger, x- slant, On one, Ready?
Break!
Hut!
Ooh!
Split left, 68, Z- go,
- You the man, Hey, butthead!
- Huh?
- You the man!
- Me the man?
On one, Ready?
390!
390!
Hut!
Oh, no!
Hudson!
Get your ass off the field!
Goddamn it!
Hudson, get your ass out of my game!
You couldn' t catch a cold!
We want that doughnut money,
OK, papa- san...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,... we want that doughnut money,
We ain' t fuckin 'around, Mr, Hi- Ho,
Look, this fuckin 'thing, it ain' t that complicated,
You give us all the fuckin 'money, you won' t get shot in the head,
A' ight?
You...
One, two, three, You understand?
- I' m a count uno, and two and...
Ah!
- Light from the lighthouse - Let it
- Oh, let it - Shine on
- Come on, let it - Shine on
- I need you to let your - Light from the lighthouse
Let it shine on me
- When you' re walkin 'in darkness - Shine on
You' ve got to come on and let it shine
Shine!
- Let it shine - Shine on
- Let it shine - Shine on
- he caught them Israelites red- handed, - Yes!
- a golden calf, - Yes!
He caught 'em worshippin' a false god,
He caught them Israelites in decline,
In decline!
What did Moses do when he saw those... declinin ', backslidin', never- mindin 'sinners?
What did he do?
Mosses smote those sinners in his wrath!
Yes, he did!
Y' all know what "smote" is?
I smite, you smite, he smites, we done smote!
To smite is to go upside the head!
Because sometimes, brothers and sisters, that' s the only way!
The only way,
To smite is to remind we got to stop that decline and scramble back up to the face of the Almighty God!
- Amen!
- Instead of worshippin 'that golden calf, that earthly trash on that garbage island,
That garbage island in the shadowland, wa- a- ay...
way outside the Kingdom of God!
That garbage island, where scavenger birds feast on the bones of the backslidin 'damned!
And so...
let us pray,
My dear lady, I do so hope this is not an inopportune time for our first practice,
Somebody die?
I beg your pardon?
Oh!
No, no, no, No, I' m not bereaved,
Though it is so kind of you to inquire, The hearse is simply a vehicle commodious enough to accommodate all the members of our ensemble,
And, of course, our instruments contrived in an age ignorant of miniaturization,
Allow me to introduce my friends, my colleagues, these devoted and passionate musicians,
Ain' t no smokin 'in this house,
Oh, Sorry,
What do you think, General?
Present any problems?
Good then, Gentlemen, why don' t we crowd around and go over the plan?
Gentlemen, this is the Bandit Queen, Gambling den, Cash cow,
Sodom of the Mississippi Delta and the focus of our little exercise,
Here is Orchard Street,
Here is the residence of Marva Munson, the charming lady whom you all met moments ago,
Gentlemen, I' m sure you' re all aware that the Solons of the state of Mississippi, to wit, its legislature, have decreed that no gaming establishment shall be erected within its borders upon dry land,
They may, however, legally float,
While the gambling activity is restricted to these riverboats, no such restrictions apply to the functions ancillary to this cash- besotted business,
The casino' s offices, locker rooms, facilities to cook and clean, and, most importantly, its counting houses, the reinforced, secret, super- secure repositories of the lucre, may all be situated... wherever,
- Gawain, where is "wherever"?
- Say what?
- Where' s the money?
- Oh,
OK, look, At the end of every shift, pit boss brings the cash down to the hold of the ship in a locked cashbox, and once a day all the cash is moved down to the countin 'room,
And where is the counting room?
Uh... it be right there in that square where you pointin ',
And what, to flog a horse that if not dead is at this point in mortal danger of expiring, does this little square represent?
Offices, Underground,
Ha!
Underground!
Underground,
During the casino' s hours of operation, the door to this counting room is fiercely guarded,
The door itself is of redoubtable Pittsburgh steel,
When the casino closes this entire underground complex is locked up, and the armed guard retreats to the casino' s main entrance,
There, then, far from the guard, reposes the money, behind a five- inch- thick steel portal, yes, But the walls... the walls are but humble masonry behind which is only the soft, loamy soil deposited over centuries by the Old Man, the meanderin 'Mississippi, as it fanned its way back and forth across the great alluvial plain, leaving earth,
This earth,
The General here, whose curriculum vitae comprehends massive tunnelin 'experience through the soil of his native French Indochina, shall be directin' our little old tunnelin 'operation,
Garth Pancake, though a master of none, is a jack of all those trades corollary to our aim,
He will be doin 'such fabricatin' and demolition work
- as our little caper shall require, - Happy to be on board,
Gawain is our proverbial "inside man,"
He has managed to secure himself a berth on the custodial staff of the Bandit Queen,
- Damn skippy!
- And this brings us to Lump,
To look at Lump, you might wonder what specialized expertise could he possibly offer our merry little old band of miscreants,
Well, gentlemen, in a project of such risks, it is imperative to enlist the services of a hooligan, a goon, an ape, a physical brute,
Someone who will be our security, our battering ram, our blunt instrument,
And, on our behalf, I wish him a warm Mississippi welcome,
- Fuckin 'A, - Whassup, my nigga?
Well, gentlemen, here you are,
Men of different backgrounds and differing talents,
Men with, in fact, but two things in common:
One, you all saw fit to answer my advertisement in the Memphis Scimitar, and two, you' re all going to be, in consequence, very, very, incredibly... rich,
Let us revel in our adventure, gentlemen,
Let us make beautiful music together, and, by all means, let us keep this to ourselves,
What we say in this root cellar, let it stay in this root cellar,
There' s no "l" in "team",
Trouble in, trouble out
Pass me the body bag watch me dump 'em
I came to O Z and broke the laws
Bring on the casket ain' t too glad
It' s OK, Don' t stop on account of me,
Not at all, We were about to take a break anyway,
Well, I just thought maybe you' d like to see...
What have you gotten into, honey?
Why you sweatin 'like that?
Uh...
That boy right there?
He plays one bitch barrel full of a sackbut!
- Ain' t that right, Lump?
I' m tellin 'you, he can tear it up, Right, Lump?
Ain' t nobody play the sackbut like Lump right there, He...
Hoo- hoo- hoo!
Don' t be shy, Lump, Don' t be shy, Lump, that boy, he go... at it like it was some pussy!
- Oh, shit!
- Mind your mouth!
This is a Christian house, boy, No hippity- hop language in here,
- Sometime it' s the only way, - Now listen, you ain' t gonna hit me...
I' m tryin 'to help you, boy, better yourself!
And so you should, madam, So you should,
Gawain is so far transported by his love of the music of the early Renaissance...
Don' t make me no never- mind, he transported!
- I understand, - You been smokin '?
Oh, certainly not, ma' am, I understand your indignation, ma' am,
And I was offering an explanation, not an excuse,
- I myself am...
- Hey, hey, hey...... don' t be explainin 'me, dawg!
You can' t read my motherfuckin 'mind, man!
You might got yo 'Ph, D,, but I got my GED!
- Yes, - Nigga!
A fiery lad... but then youth is fiery,
A fact often remarked upon by the poets of the Romantic era,
My youth, I was in church, I wasn' t walkin 'around fiery,
Youth ain' t no excuse for nothin ',
Anyhow, I just came to show you the fife, Othar' s fife, Burned his own,
I thought maybe, you bein 'a man of music, you' d be interested,
Oh, indeed I am,
Cut it hisself and burned his holes,
The Israelites called it a khalil,
Yeah, you can read all about it in the Bible, Ain' t nothin 'new under the sun,
Indeed not,
Gone these 20 years,
He was some kind of man,
Blowed the khalil,
I don' t suppose Othar ever turned his hand or, or turned his lip to blowing the shofar?
The ceremonial ram' s horn sounded by the priests of the Hebrews,
No, I don' t know nothin 'about that, Othar never blowed no shofar!
- Of course not, - Not to the extent of my knowledge,
The khalil was good enough for my Othar,
He was some kind of man,
Some kind of man,
Oh, goddamn!
Come on, girl, let me get one little peek,
Don' t be cruel, Come on, just one butt cheek,
Pull that ass out and make it clap,
Aw, just 'cause I' m dressed like a janitor, don' t mean you gotta do me dirty,
This muthafucka' s hit the jackpot, Come on, girl,
Come over here and blow on these dice,
You know, I' m a seven on the roll now, but I' m a 10 the hard way, and I ain' t just talkin 'crap,
Mr, Gudge, she had a ass that could pull a bus,
I mean, Gudge, it was more than an ass, it was literature,
Yeah, I don' t care how big her ass was, MacSam, You' re fired,
You say what?
There is no fraternizing with customers on the Bandit Queen,
- Clean out your locker, - But, Mr, Gudge, I wasn' t fraterniz...
I said get outta here, You' re fired,
You can' t fire me!
I' il sue your ass!
Sue me?
For what?
For fuckin 'punitive damages, man!
- Punitive damages, - Yeah,
Punitive damages, You goddamn skippy!
- Punitive damages, - I see why you firin 'me, Mr, Gudge,
Yeah, it' s simple and plain, You firin 'me' cause I' m black,
MacSam, everybody on the custodial staff is black,
Your replacement is gonna be black,
His replacement, no doubt, will be black!
Well, the fuckin 'judge is goin' be black, muthafucka,
- Oh, - And you?
- You gon 'stand tall before the man, - Oh,
And your replacement' s gonna be black,
- muthafucka!
- Thank you,
Oh, my,
Oh, my, my, my, my, my, my, my,
This is a severe setback,
I am distraught, I' m more than distraught,
I am devastated,
I- I' m beside myself, I' m at a positive loss for words,
- You still talkin 'OK, though, - Have you all decided?
Madam, we must have waffles, We must all have waffles forthwith,
We must all think, We must all have waffles and think, each and every one of us, to the very best of his ability,
Perhaps if you apologized to the man and gave him flowers,
Or perhaps a fruit basket with a card depicting a misty seascape and inscribed with a sentiment,
I ain' t apologizin 'to that muthafucka, He fired me' cause I' m black!
He can' t do that, You could sue him, Open and shut case,
- Fuckin 'A, - Surely a chocolate assortment has been known to melt the heart of even the hardest misanthrope,
That man ain' t rollin 'over for no fucking candy bar,
Uh, we' ve had a bit of a setback on the tunneling front, too,
- We' ve run into a pretty large rock, - Rock!
- Very bad, Very bad, - Oh, my,
Seems that the poet was right,
Troubles never singly come,
Oh, no, we can get through the rock, No worries there,
Easiest thing in the world, Why, we just blow right through it,
I got a pyro license, Just, uh, bore a hole in the rock and pack in a little plastique, Igneous blows pretty good,
- And then we could...
- Hello, Garth,
- Am I ordering the primer cord?
- Yes, Mountain,
We were just talking about that, and some plastique,
- What the fuck is this?
- Oh, this is Mountain Girl,
Mountain is my right hand, She helps me out with ordnance,
- Helps me with... damn near everything, - Hey,
You brought yo 'bitch to the Waffle Hut?
I must confess myself to be puzzled as well,
I thought it was understood that when it came to our little enterprise,
"mum" was the word,
Of course, I understand that, but this is Mountain Girl,
I don' t keep secrets from Mountain,
That' s not how you maintain a loving, caring relationship,
You brought yo 'bitch to the Waffle Hut!
The man brought his bitch... to the Waffle Hut!
All right, look, you, I will thank you to stop referring to Mountain that way,
She is the other half of my life,
Everybody lookin 'at me like I' m some kind of fuck- up for losin' a sorry- ass job, and this muthafucka brings his bitch
- to the muthafuckin 'Waffle Hut!
- Son- of- a- bitch punk!
- Shut your goddamn mouth!
- You better raise the fuck up, fucka!
You gon 'back that shit the fuck up!
- Gentlemen, please, - What?!
What?!
Please, gentlemen, this behavior does you no credit in the eyes of your colleagues, nor in those of the other patrons of this Waffle Hut,
Little punk,
Oh, look at this, I got blueberry syrup on my safari jacket!
Gentlemen, I propose that we consider the matter of this woman,
- Mountain Water...
- Mountain Girl,
I' m so very sorry, I propose that we consider this matter closed,
And we shall choose to trust her since we have no choice, and since she shall share only in Mr, Pancake 's portion of the booty,
Of course, Wouldn' t have it any other way,
- Yeah, you damn right you won' t, - Up yours, punk,
- Oh, fuck you and the Swiss Miss, - The matter of disposing
- of our igneous impediment is also...
- C- Coach...
Coach...
- C- C- Coach, I...
-... closed, Settled,
That leaves us only with the question of Gawain retrieving his job,
- Coach, I...
- Yes, Lump?
Couldn' t we just bribe the guy?
You are a readin 'fool, aren' t you, Mr, Dorr?
Yes, I must confess,
I often find myself more at home in these ancient volumes than I do in the hustle- bustle of the modern world,
To me, paradoxically, the literature of the so- called "dead tongues" holds more currency than this morning' s newspaper,
In these books, in these volumes, there is the accumulated wisdom of mankind, which succors me when the day is hard and the night lonely and long,
Mm, The wisdom of mankind, huh?
- What about the wisdom of the Lord?
- Oh...
Yes, yes, The Good Book, mm, I have found reward in its pages,
But, to me, there are other good books as well,
Heavy volumes of antiquity freighted with the insights of man' s glorious age,
And then, of course, I just love, love, love the works of Mr, Edgar Allan Poe,
Oh, I know who he was, Kinda spooky,
No, madam, no, no,
Not of this world, it' s true,
He... he lived in a dream, An ancient dream,
"Helen,
Thy beauty is to me
Like those Nicean barks of yore,
That gently, o' er a perfumed sea,
The weary, wayworn wanderer bore
To his own native shore, "
Who was Helen?
- Some kinda whore of Babylon?
- One doesn' t know who Helen was... but I picture her as being very, very... extremely... pale,
Mrs, Munson, I have been trying to figure out some way of expressin 'my gratitude to you for takin' in this weary, wayworn wanderer,
It' s just a little old present, Why, it' s hardly anything at all,
Oh, why, Mr, Dorr!
You are a gallant man,
Oh, madam, I blush, I melt, No...
I just happened to hear of this gospel concert tomorrow night,
"The Mighty, Mighty Clouds of Joy", and I thought you and a friend from church perhaps would...?
Ah?
Why, Sheriff Wyner!
How you doin '?
Good evenin ', Mrs, Munson,
I just stopped by here to let you know I did have a talk with Weemack, and he told me he' s gonna comply with your request in keepin 'that music down and neighborly,
So you just go and have yourself a pleasant evenin ',
I' m...
I' m a little pressed for time,
You got a gang of bank robbers youse chasin '?
Come on in here and say hello,
Yeah, we was in here, havin 'tea and...
Huh!
Bussed his own dishes, You can always tell a gentleman,
- Somebody was in here, ma' am?
- Yeah, with me and Othar,
Maybe I' il catch him the next time,
Oh, come on up to his room with me and say hello,
I got a family, My wife got dinner on the table,
I really have to be goin ',
- Oh, my, He is neat!
- Yes, ma' am, he very neat,
He probably went down to the cellar to play with his friends,
Ma' am, I really got to be goin 'now,
- What...?
- Ma' am, I really need to be gettin 'back,
You don' t have to...
Why, Professor!
Uh...
Oh, Lord Jesus,
- Mrs, Munson?
- Land of Goshen, child!
- Come on out from under there!
- Mrs, Munson, my pager just went off,
I got to go, Mm- hm, I' il meet you and your friend later,
That was refreshing,
Y' all have a good evenin 'now!
As you know, we academics are inordinately fond of wedgin 'ourselves
- into confined spaces, - Mm!
At Yale, the students will see how many of their number they can enclose in a telephone booth, At Harvard, a broom closet,
Hope I didn' t spill my tea,
Well, what the hell is this?
I guess it' s just my way of sayin ', um...
Oh, well, goddamn it, Mr, Gudge, Look here, I...
I don' t know what it' s like walkin 'in your shoes,
You know, with you bein 'a tight- ass and all,
And I' m pretty sure you don' t know what it' s like walkin 'in my shoes,
See, Mr, Gudge, there' s the custodian, right?
And then there' s the man inside the custodian,
And that' s the motherfucker we got a problem with,
See, 'cause that man, he got needs, Mr, Gudge, and normally those needs gotta do with women with big asses,
I guess my point bein 'is I realize I' m a bunkie junkie,
But if you woulda seen the kettle drums on this girl, Mr, Gudge, whew!
Well... we all human,
This apology buys you a one- week probationary period,
Thank you, Mr, Gudge,
Stay away from the customers, MacSam,
This drill bit' s getting awfully hot,
Gawain, maybe you could fill a Hudson sprayer and spritz it down while I drill,
Fuck you, I ain' t your motherfuckin 'house nigger, I' m the inside man,
All right, look, are you gonna have a bug up your ass for the rest of the time we work together?
- I' il get the sprayer, - Oh, no, no, No,
Me and this gentleman here have to get square,
Let me tell you somethin ', MacSam,
I' m gonna tell you about how I came down to Mississippi,
I wasn' t born here, you know, I' m from Scranton, Pennsylvania,
What the fuck?
Scranton, Pennsylvania, Came down here in 1964, Greyhound bus,
With the Freedom Riders,
Do you know who the Freedom Riders were, MacSam?
No, and I don' t give a fuck,
Just tell me when the fuck they gonna leave, Damn!
The Freedom Riders, my fine young man, were a group of concerned liberals from up north, all working together, just like we are here,
Involved citizens who came down here so that local black folk could have their civil liberties,
So that people like you could have the vote,
- You know what, man?
- What, brother?
- I don' t vote, So fuck you, - You little fuckin 'ingrate,
- And the bus you rode in on, jackass!
- Let' s step outside, MacSam!
Fuck the outside!
Come on!
What?!
My friend Mrs, Funthes is here, so I' m about to go out,
Just thought I' d leave y' all with some cinnamon cookies,
Why, that is lovely,
Ooh, y' all sound good!
(chuckles) Maybe you could come by the church one Sunday...
- give us a recital, - Why, how kind of you!
Our music, however, is, uh... well, how shall I put this?
Uh, a bit Roman in its outlook,
Uh, many of our pieces were commissioned by the Holy See,
Oh, I see, all right, but we don' t make no big whoop- dee- do about denomination,
Everybody welcome at our church, Yeah, we had a Methodist come in,
Episcopalian, Back in the '60s, we had a Jew come in!
- He had a guitar, - (chucking) A Jew with a guitar,
If you will excuse me one moment, madam, I shall, uh, I shall see you out,
If you gentlemen can labor harmoniously in the course of my absence, perhaps upon my return we shall be prepared to explode that vexin 'old piece of igneous,
Oh, Professor!
This is Mrs, Funthes,
Enchanté, Mrs, Funthes, Allow me,
Rosalie, this is Professor G, H, Dorr, Ph, D,
Oh, my, That' s an awful lot of letters,
Oh, well, no,
Of course, in my youth, I was known simply as Goldthwait,
Uh- huh,
All right, safety meeting,
Let' s listen up, General, can you hand me the primer cord?
Before we set the charge, we will run through our procedure,
I have earplugs for whoever wants them, Just wedge those right in your ears,
Now, here we have...
Not yet, Lump,
- Oh, - Now, primer cord,
Gelatinite, C- 4,
Time comes, we pack the hole in the rock with the C- 4 and insert two leads:
A and B,
I remember my father sayin 'to me - and it' s one of the few memories I retain of the man from one of his visits home, and how I do cherish it - he said to me, "Goldthwait, you are not formed as other boys,"
He a man of learnin '?
This is the same procedure we will be using when we collapse the tunnel after entering the casino vault and returning to the root cellar,
He was a self- educated man, Didn' t have a career as such, but the government did recognize the breadth of his readin 'by makin' him librarian of the state nervous hospital in Meridian, where he was a distinguished inmate,
Once these materials are combined only the professionals may handle them,
That means me or the General,
Separately they are harmless, completely inert,
Why, you could light this stuff on fire, hit it with a ham... (explosion)
What in the name of heavens was that?
I' m quite certain there' s absolutely no reason to be alarmed,
Why, I' m not even absolutely certain I heard anything at all,
Didn' t hear nothin '?!
Well, something perhaps,
Nothing that need discompose us was the sense I was tryin 'to convey,
Now, Mrs, Munson, I will not have you missin 'your musical recital, Off you go!
I shall call the gas company, or the water company,
Whatever subterranean utility is implicated in this contretemps,
Blood!
Blood, Professor, blood!
Blood, blood, blood!
(Pancake) It' s nothin 'to make a fuss about, It' s perfectly all right,
Jackass!
- Really, I' m perfectly all right, - Perfectly all right?
Jackass, you just blew your goddamn finger off!
The muthafucka down there flappin 'the fuck around!
You better get yo 'ass back down there and find it!
I' m tellin 'you right now, nubbie, I ain' t pickin' up your goddamn finger!
I gather there was a premature detonation,
Would you tell this muthafucka he can sew this shit back on?!
It' s like that dude whose wife cut his dick off, threw it on the freeway?
She just called Triple A, they towed the dick and sewed the muthafucka back on!
Listen up!
Jackass, I saw the muthafucka in a porno!
The thang still worked!
It looked like a chewed- up frank, but that little muthafucka be workin 'that muthafucka!
Oh!
Your fuckin 'finger just moved!
The muthafucka movin 'slow now!
I' m not gettin 'that shit, Fuck that!
You' re on your own there!
They usin 'the house to practice music... of the Rococo,
I propose we get our fallen comrade to the hospital,
The General will follow when he manages to recover the severed digit,
No, no, really, I' m perfectly all right, I don' t know what all the fuss is about,
- Good news!
Good news!
- Pickles!
Go get him!
The house is in apple- pie order, though we do have to get medical attention for Mr, Pancake, who, durin 'the disturbance, pinched his finger in the valve of his sackbut,
You let the cat out!
Wha...?
The General is even now exercisin 'every effort in retrievin' your mischievous little Pickles, Please, go on,
Go on and enjoy the concert!
Driver!
Au revoir, mesdames,
(Dorr) Despite our setback, we find ourselves on schedule to penetrate the vault here this afternoon, while Mrs, Munson is at church, havin 'blasted that little old rock to pieces durin' Mrs, Munson' s choir practice,
Garth, can you run us through the game plan for what remains of our tunnel?
Of course, Why, it' s child' s play now, Easiest thing in the world,
Only a couple of feet separate us from the vault,
Just the usual spadework until we get to the masonry of the vault, and then we just drill through,
And will you be able to wield the drill with your maimed extremity?
Oh, well, yeah, I should think so, Yeah, it' s, uh, it' s only one finger,
Inhibits me in doing finer work of course, I' il always have to live with that, (clears throat)
I should get a little extra compensation for the accident,
Somewhat larger share,
Why, if this was any other line of work, I' d be getting workman' s comp,
Wouldn' t I?
Might even have a pretty good lawsuit,
Wait, so you gonna sue yourself for blowing your own goddamn finger off?
- Well, now that is simply asinine, - Yes, but you see, Garth, this is not what you just called "some other line of work,"
Yeah, no, no, no, but if it were...
This is a criminal enterprise, not to put too fine a point on it, entailing any manner of risk not involved in honest labor,
Governmental regulations and civic safeguards cannot be assumed to apply to antisocial pursuits,
- Yeah, but he lost his finger, - We don' t give a fuck!
That fool could blow his goddamn dick off, it don' t make no nevermind to us!
We not payin 'this jackass for goin' around blowin 'off goddamn body parts!
Get yo 'fuckin' head out yo 'ass, man!
Look you, there is no call for...
No extra share!
OK, Majority rules,
Like I say, it was just a trial balloon, Hand' s not so bad really,
I even get some phantom feeling,
Yeah, you pull on your prick, you get some phantom feelin ',
- Fuck you, - Fuck you,
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you, nubbie!
Well, now that that matter is settled, why don' t we synchronize our watches before Gawain reports to work,
In 20 seconds, it will be exactly 12: 16,
- Fifteen...
- What, it' il be 12: 15?
No, 15 seconds, Well, 11 seconds now, It' il be 12: 16,
- Eight, seven...
- Professor?
Prof...? -... six...
- Professor?... five...
Yes, Lump!
I don' t have a watch,
Home to live with God Oh...
I' m goin 'home to live with God
Troubles of this world
I' m goin 'home to live with God
Soon I will be done with the troubles of this world
I' m goin 'home to live with God
Oh, soon I will be done
Troubles of this world
Yeah, soon I will be done
I' m goin 'home to live with God
Troubles of this world
I' m goin 'home to live with God
Whoo- hoo- hoo!
Ain' t that somethin '!
- I, B, S, - You be what?
Is there a men' s room down here?
Quickly!
You one disgustin 'individual, you know that?
Come on, Follow me,
I feel 30 pounds lighter,
- Come the fuck on with your stinkass, - Thank you for being so understanding,
Not everyone is, of course, which is why the biggest challenge of I, B, S, is educating the public,
Afflicts over two million people, yet most of us have never heard of it,
And it strikes without regard to age, gender or race,
Oh, fuck, man, I don' t wanna hear about this shit,
Well, that' s exactly the kind of attitude we' re fighting,
I guess I never told you that' s how Mountain Girl and I met,
They had an I, B, S, weekend at Grossinger' s up in the Catskills,
Of course, the tourist business there has suffered with the demise of the Borscht Belt, so they have various promotions, mixers, so on,
This was a weekend for Irritable Bowel singles to meet and support each other
- and share stories, - Man, look here,
I don' t want to hear a single one of them stories, OK?
- Now, some of them are very moving, - Not one fucking story!
- Look, I didn' t choose to have I, B, S, - Man, shut the fuck up!
There' s no cure, you know, Only control, Lifelong condition,
Yeah, you know what?
Bein 'an asshole' s a lifelong condition, too,
Just drop the fuckin 'tools,
I' m not complaining, I did meet Mountain Girl,
Man, get back in the fuckin 'hole!
(laughs) Marvel...
Marvelous, Marv...
This way!
This way, gentlemen!
Oh!
Excellent!
Excellent, Flawless, flawless, Thumbs up,
Can' t stop shittin ', Can' t stop talkin' about shittin ',
Gentlemen, to we few, We who have shared each other' s company, each other' s cares, each other' s joys, and who shall now reap the fruits of our communal efforts, shoulder to shoulder, from each according to his abilities, so forth and whatnot,
We have had our little differences along the way, but I' d like to think that they' ve only made us value one another all the more,
Each of us coming to understand and appreciate the other' s unique qualities and potencies and, yes, foibles,
I suggest that we shall look back upon this little caper one day, one distant day, grandchildren dandled upon our knee, and perhaps a tear will form and we shall say,
"Well, with wit and grit and no small amount of courage, we accomplished something on that day, a feat of derring- do, an enterprise not ignoble,"
We happy few,
- Gentlemen, to us!
- (all) To us!
Charge shoulda gone off already,
I do beg your pardon?
The charge to collapse the tunnel, I set it for eight minutes,
Well, that much time and more has certainly elapsed,
I need not remind you, it is of the essence of this plan that the money should appear to have simply vanished without a trace,
- spirited away, as it were, by ghosts, - Of course,
The conundrum of the undisturbed, yet empty vault, the unsolvable riddle of the sealed yet violated sanctum, is of the utmost importance, not only to make our caper more intellectually satisfying, it is exigent as a matter of practical fact,
I remind you that if any tunnel is ever found leading to this house, the owner knows all your names,
(stomach rumbling)
("Trouble of This World")
Nope, nope, I' m fine, Perfectly all right!
Not a problem!
There' s no hole left,
Professor!
I' m surprised!
Well... uh... properly speaking, madam, we are surprised, You are taken aback,
Though I do acknowledge that the sense that you intend is gaining increasing currency through its use, yes,
You have returned from your devotions betimes,
I had to make tea,
I want to talk to you, Professor, so don' t you be leavin '!
And you!
I told you I don' t want any smokin 'in this house!
Oh, come on in!
How you doin '?
Tea, ladies,
Now, I don' t know what you boys been up to, but I know mischief when I see it, Now, I want an explanation, but first,
I want you to get your fannies up here with all y' all' s period instruments,
Now, I been tellin 'the ladies about your music, and they want to hear you play,
- Professor?
- Yes, Lump?
I can' t really play the buttsack,
Madam, or rather, mesdames, you must accept our apologies for not bein 'able to perform, for, as you see, we are shorthanded,
Gawain is still at work, and we could no more play with one part tacit than a horse could canter shy one leg,
Perhaps I could offer, as a poor but ready substitute, a brief poetic recital,
Though I do not pretend to any great oratorical skills, (laughs)
I would be happy to present, with your ladies' permission, verse from the unquiet mind of Mr, Edgar Allan Poe,
"Ladies, thy beauty is to me
Like those Nicean barks of yore,
That gently, o' er a perfumed sea, The weary, wayworn wanderer bore
To his own native shore, "
- (ladies sigh) - My, my, my,
"On desperate seas long wont to roam,
Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,
Thy Naiad airs have brought me home
Hm?
(Dorr) Bye- bye, ladies, It was... it was my pleasure,
- (tea lady # 1) We have to do this again, - (tea lady # 2) Yes, we do got to,
Such a pleasure, Safe home, Safe home, (Mrs. Munson chuckles)
- Now I want to know what' s goin 'on, - Oh, indeed, indeed,
The thirst for knowledge is a very commendable thing,
Though I do believe that when you hear the explanation you shall laugh riotously, slappin 'your knee and perhaps even wipin' away a giddy tear, relieved of your former concern,
Lump here is an avid collector of Indian arrowheads, and having found one simply lying on your cellar floor -
- a particularly rare artifact of the Natchez tribe? -
He enlisted the entire ensemble in an all- out effort to sift through the subsoil in search of others,
And apparently, in doing so, we hit a mother lode of natural gas,
I myself became acutely aware of the smell of "rotten eggs,"
And it was just at this inopportune moment that the General here violated the cardinal rule of this house
- and lit himself a cigarette, - So sorry,
Well, what about all that money?
Ah,
The money, Well, the money is Mr, Pancake' s,
- (clears throat) That' s right, - Who only just remortgaged his home in order to raise the money for a surgical procedure that will correct the wandering eye of his common- law wife, Mountain Water, who suffers from astigmia, strabismus and a general curdling of the vitreous jelly,
Mr, Pancake is an ardent foe of the Federal Reserve, and is, in fact, one of those eccentrics one often reads about hoardin 'his entire life savings, in Mr, Pancake' s case, in a Hefty bag that is his constant companion,
- The Steel Sak, - Don' t trust the banks, Never have,
Mm- mn,
It don' t smell right to me,
- I' m callin 'Sheriff Wyner, - No!
Madam!
Please, please, Madam!
No, no, I beg of...
Yes!
Yes!
It is a lie!
It is a fantastic tale!
You have us dead to rights, but, madam, please, please, please allow me to tell you the truth in private,
Madam...
Madam, we are not musicians of the late Renaissance,
- Nor of the early, nor mid period, - Mm- hm,
We are, in fact, criminals,
Desperate men, Mrs, Munson,
We have tunneled into the nearby offices of the Bandit Queen gambling emporium
- and relieved it of its treasure, - Lord have mercy,
It is true,
The Bandit Queen is a den of iniquity, a painted harlot luring people into sin by exciting the vice of greed with her promise of easy winnings, Oh, yes,
Her gains are ill- gotten,
But, I offer no excuses - save one,
We men have each pledged one half of our share of the booty to a charitable institution,
In compensation for the use of your home, we had planned to donate a full share to Bob Jones University, without burdening you with guilty knowledge by informing you of same,
But now you have wrested the information from me,
There you have it, It is on your table, Mrs, Munson,
The "awful truth,"
- Stolen money, - But find the victim, Mrs, Munson,
I challenge you, Even the casino itself, that riparian Gomorrah, shall suffer no harm,
It has an insurance company,
A financial behemoth that will cheerfully replenish its depleted vaults,
That is its function,
And that insurance company has tens and tens of thousands of policyholders,
So that...
We have done the calculations, Mrs, Munson,
So that at the end of the day, at the final reckoning, each and every one of those policyholders shall have contributed one penny,
One, single, solitary cent to the satisfaction of this claim,
- One penny?
- One penny, Think of it, Mrs, Munson,
One penny from those thousands upon thousands of people so that Bob Jones University can continue on its mission,
Why, I have no doubt that, were those policy holders made aware of the existence of that august institution, each and every one of them would have volunteered some token amount for the furtherance of its aims,
Well, that' s prob' ly true,
Sadly, the criminal stain is upon my soul, but the benefit shall accrue to any number of worthy causes as long, that is, as the secret stays with us,
Well...
I can' t hardly see the harm in it,
- One penny?
- (mouthing) One penny,
- I' m sorry, - Excuse me?
No, I' m sorry, it' s wrong, and don' t you be leadin 'me into temptation,
- No, no, madam, I must strenuously...
- I' m sorry, it' s just plain wrong,
- Stealin '!
- No, madam...
- I know your intentions was good, - No, they weren' t!
And I won' t call the police if you give back the money and y' all go to church with me next Sunday,
And engage in divine worship?!
I' ve made up my mind,
Now, you can doubletalk all you want, It' s church or the county jail,
Think it over, I gotta feed the cat,
(plucks strings)
- Motherfuck!
- Yes,
Unfortunately, Mrs, Munson has rather complicated the situation,
Yeah, well, I know how to decomplicate it,
You bust a cap in that old bitch' s head, everything be simple,
Not easy to do, Many reasons,
Practical ones:
Quiet neighborhood, sleepy town,
Reasons of moral repugnance:
A harmless woman, a deed conceived and executed in cold blood,
Oh, no, Gawain, would that it were simple,
What we gonna do?
Give the money back and go to church?
I shudder, I quake,
You, sir, are a Buddhist,
Is there not a "middle" way?
Must float like a leaf on the river of life...... and kill old lady,
Yes, yes, I suppose you are right,
It is the active nature of the crime, though, that so abhors,
The squeezing of the trigger, the plunging of the knife,
But... let us think a moment,
What other tools do we have at hand?
We have the cellar,
We have the cavity,
We have masonry and trowel,
Perhaps we could simply... immure her,
Sure, Easiest thing in the world, I can whip up a little mortar in a snow saucer,
Lay the bricks, Anchor in some chains,
Mountain Girl could outsource the manacles,
Ah, gentlemen, gentlemen, we delude ourselves,
No, shortest and painless is best,
Gawain' s gun, retort muffled by a pillow, into the brain, (claps) The affair of an instant,
The only question is who wields the weapon?
I believe it is traditional in such circumstances to draw straws,
Fair enough, Here you go, Lump,
I' m thinkin ', though, that since I lost a finger -
- and I mean literally lost it 'cause of that fuckin' cat - maybe I should be excused from this thing,
Hard for me to squeeze a trigger anyway,
You one whiny muthafucka,
I' il come over there and squeeze your fuckin 'nutsack, you keep that bullshit up,
Shut up, punk!
- I' il kick your goddamn ass, sweet- legs!
- Gentlemen!
No special pleading, No exceptions,
Well, OK, it was just a trial balloon,
Fuck you,
Motherfuck!
Lord, I' m troubled
Lord, I' m troubled
Lord, I' m troubled Oh, Lord, by my soul
- Oh, Lord, I' m troubled - Lord, I' m troubled
Lord, I' m troubled
- (TV) Oh, would you like a hot cross bun?
- No, just an explanation.
Coming up!
- Ouisie, I' il take some cocoa.
- Hi, George.
What' s goin 'on?
George!
How did they get in here?!
- What you got there, Gawain?
- Why, nothin ', Mama,
Nothin ', my ass!
You got a dog there!
- No, Mama, - A filthy, noisy little pest of a puppy dog
- gonna shit all over the house!
- He won' t shit in the house, Mama,
I' m gonna train him, I promise, I' il train him real good!
I' m gonna train you real good!
You wait till your daddy get home, He gonna lay into you proper!
No, Mama!
Please, Mama!
I love you!
Your daddy gonna kick yo 'ass!
Mama' s whuppin 'Gawain' s ass!
Ain' t you gonna use the strap, Mama?
I love you, Mama, I' m sorry, Mama, I love you,
Yeah, I' il wipe the dog' s ass and everything, Mama,
I' il train him to shit in the toilet, Mama,
- I' il wipe his ass and everything, Mama, - What you doin '?
What you doin 'with my pillow?
- Ugh!
- I' m displeased with you!
- Fine colored boy like you
- Ugh!
Now, I know your mama taught you better than that!
I can' t do it, She remind me of my mama,
- Look, man...
- Why, this is most irregular,... y' all muthafuckas just gonna have to draw straws again,
Wait a minute, You' ve got to accept your responsibilities, young man, and shoot that old lady,
Hey, man, fuck you and your irritated bowel!
Must shoot,
Now, look here, it' s the easiest thing in the world,
Just pretend her head' s a casaba melon and the gun is a melon baller,
What the fuck are you talkin 'about?
A melon baller?
- Look, man, you do it, - Oh, this is most irregular,
Now, look, with equal rights comes equal responsibility,
I' m afraid Mr, Pancake is correct, We cannot draw straws again,
The exercise would lose all credibility if you show the loser can simply beg off,
Must shoot,
Hey, look, man, she' s just an old colored lady to you,
Come on, man, you do it,
- Why, you sniveling little coward, - What did you say to me?
- Sniveling little coward, - You whiny muthafucka,
I will come up yo 'stankin', irritated asshole with this gun and give you a lead colonic, muthafucka!
You think you scare me, you mewling punk?
You don' t scare me, Bull Connor and all his dogs didn' t scare me!
Now, be a man,
You fuck!
You ain' t no fuckin 'man!
- Oh, my, this is most distressin ', - Be a man!
You ain' t no fuckin 'man!
Fuckin 'a 60- year- old with pigtails!
Why, you bastard punk!
Mountain Girl is 53!
- She could ride your ass to jelly!
- Oh, yeah?!
(gunshot)
Oh, my God,
Oh, no,
Oh, my,
- I think he' s hit, - (Lump) Oh, no,
I' il just check the carotid artery,
- That' s a negative, - Is he dead, Professor?
Oh, sure he' s dead, Lump, I just checked his carotid artery, (Dorr) Well, this is most irregular,
We shall need a Hefty bag,
She is in the kitchen,
You steal out with the carcass while I dazzle her with conversation,
My dear Mrs, Munson, I have outlined your position with my colleagues, and I now return to you to render our collective verdict,
There was much spirited discussion and an atmosphere of frank give- and- take,
Some of our number were initially appalled at your proposal that we simply return the money, Some were more receptive,
I don' t care if they was receptive or not!
And that attitude, madam, was a factor in our discussions,
To a man, I must say they were devastated at the prospect of not being able to contribute to their respective charities,
- Well, that is a shame, - Indeed, but at the end of the day, your position prevailed,
So we have decided to return the money, every last cent of it, and attend Sunday services, rather than spend the remainder of our days wastin 'away at the Mississippi Men' s Correctional Facility, (thud)
(grunts)
You are not assistin 'with the cadaver,
Oh, no need,
Just chuck it off the bridge, Easiest thing in the world,
- I' m just cleanin 'up here, - (door shuts)
Oh!
That' s them, Back already,
I' il just go dump these in the hearse,
Yeah, easiest thing in the world,
General!
(grunts/ stomach rumbling)
- Mountain?
- Garth?
- I, B, S,, dear?
Oh, come
- Go back to God - Oh, come on
- Let' s go back to God - Let us go back
- Let' s go back to God - Come on
Let' s go back to God
Get Garth,
Let us go back
Go back to God
(continues snoring)
They crucified the Savior
They crucified the Savior
They crucified the Savior
And nailed Him to the cross (song continues)
(grunts)
Now, Lump, it falls to you to finish the job,
- The comedy must end, - You know,
- I' ve been doin 'some thinkin', Professor, - Oh, dear,
Maybe we should be goin 'to church, Maybe she is right,
Ooh, dear, Lump, I feared those would be your words,
I am a professor, The professor, as you yourself so often say, The thinker,
Trained, in fact, in the arts of cogitation,
Yeah, I know, but...
Ah, ah, ah!
No buts, dear boy, Do not repeat the error of thinkin ',
Now is the moment of praxis, Now, Lump, you must act,
Well, I can' t do it, Professor, A nice old lady like that,
Think of the riches, Lump, that you and I alone shall divide,
Yeah, I know, but...
And reflect also that if you decline to act, thus forcin 'me to do so, you shall no longer have any entitlement to the money,
Your offices shall have been nugatory,
You mean you' re gonna kill her?
Of course, yes, My hand shall be forced,
I can' t allow you to do that, Professor,
- Mm- hm,
Not allow?
What presumption!
You stupid boy!
You very, very, extremely stupid boy,
Oh, yeah?
Who looks stupid now?
No bullets?
Perhaps it had to be thus,
In yon brilliant window- niche
How statue- like I see thee stand... "
A raven,
The agate lamp within thy hand! "
Uh- huh,
Professor?
Couldn' t face the music,
I appreciate that, but we don' t know what to do, Tried that, too,
Oh...
- Uh, Mrs, Munson...
- Gotta make a statement, Sheriff,
Ma' am, could it possibly wait?
We' re kinda busy down here today,
Oh, well, I suppose it could wait, but it' s about that casino money,
Let me call you back, You know somethin 'about it?
Somethin '?
Everything!
I got it at home,
- You got what at home?
- The money! $1, 6 million dollars,
- It' s down in my root cellar, - How did it get there, Marva?
Well, a bunch of desperate men stole it and put it there, that' s how!
- The ringleader spoke in dead tongues, - Does he now?
- That night, - Yes, ma' am,
And I guess I made 'em feel real bad,
And they let Pickles out!
So you want us to come over and fetch him,
- Keep it?
It is just a penny off of everybody' s policy,
- Yes, ma' am?
Pickles!
I know I' ve got religion and I ain' t ashamed to let
Angels in the heaven done wrote my name
Let your light from the lighthouse shine on
Oh, let it shine on
Oh, let it shine on
Let our light from the lighthouse shine on me
- Oh, let it - Shine on
- Let it shine - Shine on
- Let it shine - Shine on
- You want to see the light - Shine on
Let it
Come on
Let it shine Ooh
- Oh, you gotta shine on me - Shine on
- I said shine on me - Shine on
On
Me!
Let it shine on me, yeah
Shine on!
Shine on!
- From the lighthouse - Shine on
Yeah- ah- ah
Hallelujah!
Yeah
We all start off in life with a dream, don' t we?
For a tennis player, it' s being in the final of the Grand Slam... center court, a high lob, a smash.
Game, set and match... you' re a champion.
You' re number one.
But for most tennis players, that' s all it ever is... a dream.
The reality is another story... my story.
You see that good- looking fella?
No, not the kid in white.
The other, tired, good- looking fella.
Him.
Well, that' s me.
British Davis Cup a long time ago.
Two singles titles even longer ago.
Presently ranked 119th in the world.
Sport is cruel.
Now, I know it doesn' t sound too bad.
Four million tennis players in the world, and I' m 119th.
But what that really means is this... 118 guys out there are faster, stronger, better and younger.
And it gets you thinking.
You' il be 32 in...
The prime of my life.
How long can Peter Colt keep playing this game?
Time to retire gracefully.
Stop it.
These young guys... where do they get the energy, the focus?
No fear.
You see, the one thing you can' t have is fear.
And for the first time in my life, I' m afraid.
I' m not even afraid of the kid.
I' m afraid of what happens if that ball keeps going by me.
What happens then?
I hope you don' t mind, but I took the liberty of having it engraved.
- Wow.
- Exactly.
Frankly, my biggest problem is parking.
Right.
Mm, not for you, of course.
Nameplate again.
Oh, good.
Hello, Ian.
Mm- hmm.
Peter Colt, the one and only.
Once ranked 15th in the world, I hear.
Yes.
Peter' s got himself a wild card at Wimbledon.
- Then we' re hoping he' il be hanging his racket here at the club.
- Well, we' il see.
We shall look forward to giving you a peek at our ground strokes.
Won' t we, ladies?
Good luck at the championships, young man.
- Thank you very much.
Yes.
Carry on.
Peter.
Watch the ladies.
Occupational hazard.
Of course.
Oh, look at this.
Completely new hybrid.
Yes, developed by the Yanks.
Firm but springy.
I can' t wait forever.
There' s no one else I' d rather...
Ian.
Look no further.
You have your tennis director.
Oh, that is splendid.
So splendid.
Oh, look.
That' s Peter Colt, the new pro.
Once ranked 17 th in the world.
I was ranked 11 th in the world.
What makes one tennis player different from another?
But the great ones have something else.
Some say it' s a supportive family.
Others say it' s being hungry, really hungry.
But as you can see, I' ve never been hungry.
And as far as a supportive family goes...
Dad?
Anybody home?
Hello, Carl.
Life still giving you trouble, is it?
"Deep Throat." Director' s cut.
Hey.
They' ve been at it like that...
like cats and dogs... for weeks.
You all right, Dad?
Yes, yes, yes.
'Cause, you know, I don' t wanna miss your grand finale.
Interesting bit of trivia actually.
I' ve never won a match at Wimbledon with my family in attendance.
We' re not invited?
No.
- She' s not gonna like that.
- What won' t I like?
Hello, darling.
You' re looking rather gaunt.
Thank you.
Oh.
Ridiculous man.
For some reason, he believes I' m having an affair with Eliot Larkin.
He saw you snogging in the club car park.
Well, that would do it.
Not in the kitchen.
I wanted your father to see us.
Shake him out of his stupor, compel him to act.
Not what your father and I had in mind all those years ago cheering you on.
Because I believe you to be a truly great tennis player.
Oh, God.
You' ve just always been afraid to admit it to yourself.
I' m old.
Oh, don' t be absurd.
Thirty- one is not old.
It is in tennis years.
I might as well be your age.
Thank you, dear.
And I' m tired of hotels, and I' m tired of airports... and long- distance love affairs that never go anywhere and...
- Losing?
- Yeah, losing.
Thanks, Carl.
Tickets?
Oh, God.
You really are a wanker, aren' t you?
Harsh but fair.
Why doesn' t he have the tickets?
I mean, do you know why?
Does he think we' re going to sit here watching it on television?
Dad, what are you doing up there?
Right.
Well, I' m off up to Wimbledon then.
Righto.
Peter.
Yeah.
Remember I always told you that tennis was a gentleman' s game?
Yeah.
Total bollocks.
Everything I ever told you... total bollocks.
Right then.
- Welcome to the Dorchester, Mr. Colt.
- Thank you.
You have a suite, top floor.
Wonderful view.
Really, I think you might have made a...
Thank you.
Well, they weren' t wrong about the view.
You need something?
Yeah, I...
I' m so sorry.
I was given the key to Room 1221.
Your 1221.
Well, that makes perfect sense.
- What makes perfect sense?
- You see, I' d reserved a more modest room.
Now I' il go down to the front desk and... thank them for this dreadful error.
Good- bye then.
Yes, good- bye.
And may I say good body...
Luck!
I meant...
Oh.
This way.
See now?
Yeah.
I get a lot of questions about my personal life.
- I usually don' t answer them.
- That' s why it' s called a personal life.
I mean, I just want to focus on my game, you know?
I have to agree with my dad on this one... all that other stuff just gets in the way.
Some of the players think you go out of your way to disrupt a match.
I really don' t.
I mean, you know, maybe I go a little over the top sometimes, but, you know, maybe that' s what I need to do to play my best.
And that' s why I came to London... to win Wimbledon.
We' il be watching.
Good luck.
Gonna knock 'em dead this year, Peter?
That' s the idea, Danny.
Thanks, Danny.
- See you later.
- Hey, Dieter.
You wanna go for dinner?
Afraid not.
There' s a chance I may get lucky tonight.
Oh, really?
Intriguing Irish girl.
Her father owns much of Dublin.
Excellent.
She have a sister?
Only child.
Tragic.
I should stay and work on my serve anyway.
I wanna go out in style.
Well, that' s the spirit, old man.
Bugger.
Wrong court.
Forgotten me already?
God, no.
Uh- huh.
Lizzie Bradbury, right?
And you' re?
Peter.
Peter Colt.
Nice to meet you, Peter Peter Colt.
- Mm- hmm.
Ten bucks says you can' t hit two in a row.
You' re on.
Lovely form.
Thank you.
You' re exceeding my expectations.
Mine too.
Ooh.
The pressure' s on.
Lovely toss.
- Fish- and- chips it is then.
- Lizzie, sweetheart, what the heck are you doing?
- Oh, just one more serve, Daddy.
Two seconds, okay?
It' s funny.
You don' t seem the "Daddy" type.
Hit this one, and I' il sleep with you.
I' m so sorry!
Too bad.
You could' ve used the workout.
Hello, and welcome to day one of the championships, where the players meeting on center court today... include Andy Roddick, Serena Williams... and Britain' s best hope for a title, Tom Cavendish.
Other Brits in action include journeyman veteran Peter Colt.
And today marks the Wimbledon debut of American Lizzie Bradbury.
We' il see if she can live up to her lively reputation.
What are you talking about?
The chalk flew up.
There' s a mark right there.
- The ball was out.
- Get on with it!
You know what, I' il let it go.
'Cause you obviously can' t see it, and I feel sorry for you.
30- 15.
Quiet, please.
Yes!
How are you doing?
3: 00.
Ajay Bhatt.
You ever heard of him?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Look.
Oh, my God.
Shouldn' t he be off discovering masturbation or something?
Played him at Bogota.
He' s like all young men... out to destroy us, to kill the father.
And you taught him that lesson in Bogota?
Sadly, no.
He killed the father... straight sets.
Watch out for his backhand.
Twenty pound to win...
Ajay Bhatt.
Hold on.
Isn' t he playing your brother?
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Yeah, but, curiously, I' m not.
This is the end.
This is what it looks like.
1, 000 balls a day, 300 days a year, for 25 years.
Six million balls.
And it all ends here, at 2: 00 in the afternoon on Court 17... while they' re over on center court screaming for the latest Russian teenage beauty.
Ajay.!
Come on, Ajay.!
- Good luck, Mr. Colt.
- Thank you.
Bhatt to serve.
First set.
Right then.
Play.
Love- 15.
Okay, nice.
Not embarrassing.
Oi.!
Bloody rabbit.!
Crowd Cheering, Announcer, Indistinct]
Come on.
I must say he' s playing with newfound confidence today.
Yes.
Yes.!
Come on.!
Get it.!
Yes.!
Good shot.!
Well done.!
Come on.!
Yes.!
That' s it.!
He' s done it.!
He' s done it.!
He' s through round one!
Not interested.
What?
I expect, one day, to be the answer to the trivia question:
Who beat Ajay Bhatt in his first ever Grand Slam?
It' s my 13th actually.
Jake.!
Come on, man. tennis.
That' s my retirement from tennis... effective the moment this tournament ends.
Tomorrow morning, I want you at the rear entrance, 9: 00 sharp.
We can avoid all of this, all right?
Yeah, you' re probably right.
Excuse me, ladies, if you please.
Come on, sweetheart.
Hey, Lizzie!
Lizzie!
How' s your injury?
Congratulations.
Uh, say, 7: 00?
Room 1221.
That' s my 1221.
Oh, bollocks!
It' s open.... kuiper belt appears tonight in the northern sky.
Once mistaken for a shooting star, the comet gained its name... from two U. S. servicemen on patrol in the South Pacific.
It' s the first time in 67 years it' s appeared... and will be visible to the naked eye for the next two weeks.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Um...
What?
Let me just...
Oh, geez.
Are you hungry?
I' ve got a question for you.
All right.
Where do you come down on the whole "fooling around before a match" issue?
Well, that' s a very intriguing question.
'Cause I think a little fooling around can be really good for your game.
You know, help you relax.
Um, I' m not sure I' ve done enough research to have a definitive opinion.
Yes, it is, isn' t it?
It is... very sad.
Don' t get me wrong.
Are you?
I' m interested.
Peter?
No one can know about this, okay?
Really?
I had been planning a brief press statement.
Seriously.
Especially my dad.
He' s convinced, if there' s a guy around, my first serve gets mushy.
So... we' il keep it light.
Okay?
Absolutely fine with me.
We' il just keep it, you know, fun and... relaxed.
Good.
Peter?
More research.
And that' s another point lost.
The truth is that Dragomir... seems to have completely seized control on this court, known as "the graveyard of champions."
For some reason, Peter Colt' s game this afternoon... has been less than inspired.
Oh, God!
Oh, God, I' m tired.
Of course you are.
Stay up all night doing research, you' re bound to be.
Game...
Dragomir.
What a pity.
Dragomir leads five games to four in the fourth set and by two sets to one.
Hello!
Do you mind?
He was doing so well.
I wouldn' t write him off just yet, Pauline.
Some young men, I find, have a stamina that' s... really quite deceptive.
That' s not so bad.
He did win the French Open.
At least you got three games off him.
Three games?
Three lousy games?
Last match of your career, and you got three games?
It' s pathetic.
Come on, Peter.!
Well, at least there' s no one here to see you lose.
Come on, Peter.!
Oh, great.
Come on, Pete.!
Love- 15.
Who would have thought, 40 minutes ago, that we' d be in a fifth set?
But here, Peter Colt... who hasn' t beaten a top- 10 player in the past two years, remember... is at 5- 4, three points from winning the match.
30- love.
- You were with me last match.
- Yes, sir.
Brilliant play, sir.
- Do you think I could trouble you...
- Sorry.
40- love.
And we have our first match point.
- Out!
Colt.
- Three sets to two::
6 - 4, 4- 6, 2- 6, 7- 5, 6- 4.
I thought I' d done my last one of these.
So did we.
Yeah.
Peter, did you know that Dragomir is the first seeded player you' ve defeated in three years?
Uh, two months and 14 days.
But who' s really counting?
What do you think of your next opponent?
Truthfully, in all the excitement, I haven' t even checked to see who it is.
Dieter Prohl.
So two friends must now face each other as enemies.
An intriguing existential dilemma.
Room 1221, please.
Is your elbow playing up?
That' s terrible.
Is that what our friendship' s come to?
Dodgy shoulder maybe?
The truth is, most everything aches.
What doesn' t, I can' t feel at all.
Tell me about it.
Hello?
Mm!
We should still practice together.
We must stick to the routine.
The hotel offered me a better room.
At such moments, our superstitions are all we have.
Even when I' m taking a shit, I must do it exactly the same.
I' d never thought of that.
That' s genius.
You think of everything important... you do it the same.
Oh, wait a minute.
Oh, that' s okay.
Lizzie, listen, don' t say a word.
I was thinking a repeat of the other night...
Sh...
Mr. Bradbury, hello.
Mr. Bradbury?
Yeah?
- Peter.
- Billi.
Come stai?
You are the Dragomir slayer.
How are you?
You look a million... lira.
I try.
No.
Hi.
So?
I' m looking for Lizzie Bradbury.
No.
Maybe you should ask Jake Hammond.
Why?
Why do you think?
Ah.
Well, I' d better get a move on.
Ciao.
Good luck tomorrow.
Thank you.
- Yeah.
- Wouldn' t happen to be my daughter?
Yes, it would.
It' s Colt, right?
Yes, but please call me Peter.
S - Sorry.
Just to clarify.
Do you see me as a distraction?
That' s exactly how I see you.
Is that clear?
I suppose, in a few thousand years, the English will evolve webbed feet.
Yes.
No, no, no.
No.
I' m laughing at you, not with you.
Somebody wants you.
Oh, you know what?
I think I' il...
I think you will too.
See?
Now that was quite funny.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, get some rest tonight.
I don' t wanna win too easily, what with you and that, what is it, bad knee?
I have a little confession to make.
When you, uh, walked into my room the other day,
I knew exactly who you were.
You did?
Mm- hmm.
I saw you play Tommy Haas at the Lipton last year.
Oh, shit.
Yeah.
You were ahead, but then you totally fell apart, remember?
You gallantly carried her off the court.
To lose like that when you were playing so beautifully?
Until finally you walked into my hotel room.
Like a knight in shining armor perhaps?
Trouble is, I' m the one that needs saving.
Yesterday, I was losing, and then I saw you watching.
What?
Perhaps my first serve' s getting a little mushy.
Mm- hmm.
This year' s love had better last
Oh.
Hey, look.
See, with the little tail behind it?
Hardly anything, is it?
We have to wish on it.
Did you wish on your next match?
It wouldn' t work if I told you.
Who do you play?
Good friend of mine actually.
A friend?
Then you should know how to beat him.
What are his weaknesses?
Um, sausages, Wagner, men in leather shorts.
In his game.
That' s why I gave up having girlfriends in tennis.
You have to dig extra deep to kill your friends.
Now I have to kill him?
Without thinking twice.
And I don' t envy you.
You practice together, you travel together, you practically live together.
Do you really have what it takes to close out a friend in the third round of Wimbledon?
Because that is killing him.
It' s a bullet to the heart.
That' s what' s tough about this game.
There' s a winner, and there' s a loser.
And tomorrow, one of you is going to be a loser.
Bloody pedals!
Vij.
Man, Roddick lost toJake Hammond in four sets, mate.
What about Peter and Prohl?
Didn' t hear?
Straight sets, man.
Pete decimated him.
Shit!
Oh, what, you bet against him again?
You know, that bastard usually comes through for me.
He' s been on such a good losing streak.
Are you, uh, Peter Colt' s brother?
I' ve seen you in here watchin 'the matches.
Yeah.
- You could say tennis is my life.
- My passion' s chat rooms.
Really?
Hmm.
Broadband.
Of course.
You may have humiliated the kraut, but you' re not done with him.
You change your routine not one iota.
I' m still your practice partner.
Thanks, mate.
Anyway, you know it was a hell of a lot closer than the score.
A let- cord here or there, it would have been a different story.
Bullshit.
You annihilated me.
You...
You hit from the soul, the heart.
Something' s happened to you.
The girl in the taxi.
That' s...
Admit it.
Do you think that, in the middle of a championship... and for the first time in years I' m actually winning,
I' d be dumb enough to get involved with a woman?
Well, aren' t I popular?
Peter.
Well done.!
Take as long as you need before you start with us.
Oh, and the, uh... the ladies send their regards.
You were incredible today.
I have a free day tomorrow.
I' il call you later.
Peter, remember me?
It' s your mother.
- I hear congratulations are in order.
- What did I always say about ya?
I don' t know.
Remind me, Ron.
So, uh, cucumber and cucumber?
What are you doing here, Ron?
You' re not still my agent, are you?
What are you talkin 'about?
What am I talking about?
Okay, well, I called you about a year ago, and I' m still waiting for you to return my call.
Yeah, I' m into e- mails now.
I don' t do the, uh, phone thing anymore.
Ron?
That' s a lie.
Yeah, it' s a lie.
You want me to be completely honest with you?
We can' t sell a product that doesn' t exist.
But here you are existing again, so I' m back selling again.
You know what, Ron?
I genuinely despise you.
And you know what, Peter?
Because this could all be over by Monday.
Cavendish is a serve- and- volley guy, and you' ve always played shit against them, so I' d like to capitalize now if that' s not a problem with you.
I don' t want you to go down in history... as that English guy who beat his best friend, the German guy, only to get beat by the other English guy.
You got a problem with that?
You' d have to cut your commission.
Okay, look, unfortunately that' s a no- go area.
Everybody pays 10%.
Say five percent, or the next offer' s four.
You know, success has really changed you.
And I' m loving it.
Screw it.
Besides, I have a funny feeling that Cavendish is going down.
Yes.
I' d love some.
Now let' s get down to business.
- I have a thing later.
I' il call you back.
- I' il ring you tomorrow.
That' s fine.
Tomorrow' s fi...
Lizzie.
Ronny.
There she is.
How they hangin '?
Fine.
And yours?
Who' s your new friend?
You going to introduce me?
I' m Lizzie.
Peter.
Peter Colt.
"The" Peter Peter Colt?
- The one and only.
- Oh, I' ve heard a lot about you.
Oh, really?
That you' re a man who' s not afraid to come to the net.
Every chance I get.
If this works out, do I get the, uh...
You can have 10% of our kids.
The kids.
That' s a...
Are you all right?
Thank you.
You come along and play matchmaker?
I' m sorry.
We can talk over this whole Nike thing, and you' il still have her home before she turns into a pumpkin.
One day, none of this will be ours.
Oh, no.
4: 00.
Lizzie, what' s the deal?
I' ve left you, like, half a dozen messages.
Oh, really?
How about that?
Hi.
Do you know Peter Colt?
Yeah, we did meet once.
First round, San Jose, last year.
A memorable match.
Yeah, which I, like, won.
Peter' s in the quarters.
Did you hear?
Wait a second.
Are you screwing him?
- You know what?
- You are, aren' t you?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you, grandpa, ranked, like, 120?
I thought all those things they said about you were just rumors, but you really are a cheap little...
Jesus!
Are you all right, sir?
I' m fine.
Good night, Jake.
Hey, yes, don' t get up.
Leave me alone.!
I' m fine.!
That' s the first time I' ve ever hit anybody in my whole life.
Lizzie?
Other side.
I' ve never had anyone fight for my honor before.
Jesus Christ!
Wait till you see me drive.
So, these are the wild streets of my youth.
The drugs, the sex, the milk shakes.
My parents live here, and I still keep a flat.
Oh, so we can stay there tonight.
Yeah.
But what about your dad?
Aw, let him find his own place.
Parents are such a responsibility.
They' re worse than children.
Oh, definitely.
My parents got divorced when I was 13.
My mom was always on the road trying to be a singer.
What went wrong?
She couldn' t sing.
So mainly my dad brought me up.
Mine are still together.
Which proves that love' s not just blind, it' s bloody stupid.
Everything they used to love in each other now seems to drive them crazy.
I can' t imagine ever wanting to get married.
No.
I mean, that' s why we love the tour, isn' t it?
There' s always another country, another airport.
Another girl.
That' s right, Leslie.
Lizzie.
I meant Lizzie.
You said "Leslie." Who' s Leslie?
As you can see, we' ve, uh, we' ve had to fire the builders due to creative differences.
And truthfully, Peter' s had a little bit of a liquidity problem.
Oh, my nan liked to drink.
Sherry.
Right.
Just a bitty.
- Carl, what are you doing?
- Uh, Pete.
And...
Shit!
That' s Lizzie Bradbury.
No, you bloody can' t.
- It' s digital.
- Look what I found.
Oh, hello.
Give me that.
Who are you?
Oh, I only got four pizzas.
Oh, for God' s sake!
Get out.
You too, sunshine.
Bugger!
I' m sorry.
Move it.!
Change of venue, girls.
Come on.
- Big fan.
- Come on.
I am so sorry.
Hi, Daddy.
It' s me.
I know you' re probably going nuts and wanna kill me.
Really.
Um, it' s hard to explain, but I really needed to do this.
And...
I' il...
I' il see you at practice in the morning.
- Everything all right?
- Everything' s great.
Aren' t we gonna have a workout?
I thought we just had one.
Now, are you sure about this?
I usually do 10 miles.
- Why are you running behind me?
Snip by snip
I' m oozin' it bit by bit Yeah
I' m takin' it step- by- step
Boy, here and now
And I won' t let it go
Hey, look at that.
This is where my dad taught me to play tennis.
Look at it now.
It' s a shame.
Yeah.
Come on.
Ace!
What' s the matter with you?
Are you scared of a girl?
- There' s something I haven' t told you.
- What?
This is my last tournament, no matter what happens.
But you' re doing so great.
- Hey, you just have to...
Right.
Oh, finally.
Colt returns with a somewhat demure crosscourt forehand.
Ah.!
With unladylike effort,
Oh.!
It' s an extremely high lob.
What' s happened to the ball?
Good- bye.
Hundred quid on Cavendish in the quarters.
Hold your horses.
It' s tactical.
If he loses, I get rich.
Where the heck did you get a hundred quid anyway?
I trust you slept well after your night of debauchery with young master.
I declare, I surely did.
Good.
So did I. God.
No wonder the English never win Wimbledon.
I' d love to see an English guy in the finals, but give me a break.
Oh.
Wanker.
God, it' s incredible how much that actually looks like your dad.
Oh, shit.
Incredible how much that building...
Shit!
Quick.!
Hide.!
Oh, Carl!
Oh, hello.
Mr. Bradbury.
She...
Sadly, gone.
She had to go and work on that first serve.
I expect she meant to meet you at the practice courts.
Are you bullshitting me?
Absolutely not.
I wouldn' t dream of it.
So, how was your trip down?
We left early.
Well, the early bird does catch the worm.
Uh, wou- would you like a cup of, uh, tea?
Maybe something stronger.
A shot at me.
It' s Peter, right?
Yeah.
Look, Peter, I got nothing against you personally.
- You seem like a nice guy, and, uh...
- Oh, good.
I' m not an idiot.
I know that Lizzie likes to... have her fun.
And it keeps her relaxed.
Um, if you were just another easy...
Well, that would be one thing.
But you' re not, are you?
As a matter of fact, I was incredibly easy.
No, no.
This time, it' s different.
She' s... falling for you.
- Oh, I see.
- Which is a total disaster.
But why?
She' s hardly lost a set.
Look, her footwork is off.
Her serve is a mess.
She' s gotta get her head back in the game.
And what do you think that is?
- I still want it.
- Oh.
I want to win Wimbledon.
I' m sorry.
That' s all right, sweetheart.
Well, we' d better get going.
- You' re gonna go?
- Yeah.
He' s right.
I' m sorry.
Lizzie?
Lizzie.!
This is my decision.
We can be together after the tournament.
After the tournament?
What does that mean?
She won' t be at the hotel.
If you' re together, she can' t play.
- Tom.!
Tom.!
Well, this may be an all- British affair, but Tom Cavendish is clearly in control of the crowd and the match today.
He' s up a break in the first set, and Peter Colt... with the expectations of an entire nation upon him... seems to be withering under the pressure.
Ladies and gentlemen, quiet please.
40- love.
So that' s set point for Tom Cavendish.
Linda, to the patio door.
Well, talk to Sergei.
She hits short, you come in.
Daddy, stop bugging me.
She' il never pass you.
I' m focused.
I know the game plan.
Yeah, right.
He' s out of my head now.
It' s over.
Stop freaking out on me.
It was definitely his ankle.
Cavendish.!
Cavendish.!
Cavendish.!
Peter Colt may havejust got himself a free pass to the semis.
Think you can go on?
Not so fast, Chrissy.
Listen to the crowd.
They worship the kid here.
The question is, will Colt be able to take advantage of Tom Cavendish?
He' s never shown much of a killer instinct.
Quiet, please.
- 40- love.
There' s your answer, John.
Look at that smile.
Watch out, Tom Cavendish.
Can we take another route?
Her match is at 3: 00.
I doubt it.
It' s a chocker.
What' s the score, sweetheart?
It' s match point.
He' s done it.!
Peter Colt has done it again.!
Another seeded player goes down, and Colt will now take on fifth seed Pierre Maroux in the semifinals on Friday.
Congratulations, my friend.
What?
I' ve just destroyed their best hopes of winning a championship.
Oh, ridiculous.
Everyone loves a winner.
Everybody but the British.
Thank you.
See, I was right.
Everything' s good.
Everybody loves you.
Almost everybody.
30- all.
What do you think makes her so extraordinary?
No embarrassment, no fear.
She makes a decision, she goes for it, all pistons firing.
It' s a turn- on for the rest of us' cause most of the time, let' s face it, we' re all scared shitless.
Me?
I hate making a decision.
Like right now, I' m very, very afraid.
If you don' t see that girl again, it' s going to mess with your head, screw up your confidence.
On the other hand, I' m terrified...
Where' s the girl camped out, Ron?
First- floor apartment.
I made a decision.
Miss Bradbury.
Me too.
Shh.
No.
Hi.
It' s not what you think, so don' t start...
I will.
You want that on you conscience?
Thank you.
Lizzie?
Lizzie?
Lizzie, it' s me.
Shit!
Hey!
Shut up!
Bugger!
- Peter.
- Yeah.
- What are you doing here?
- That' s an excellent question.
That sad fact of the matter is, I can' t seem to get through 24 hours without you.
I missed you, Peter Peter Colt.
You have?
But I need you to go.
No, you need me to stay.
Peter.
Lizzie.
Is that what we' re doing here?
Good thing you didn' t get the wrong room.
I did, but your dad' s a very quick shag.
Good morning.!
BBC London 94. 9.
The lark' s on the wing and everything' s for the best... in this best of all possible worlds, 'cause it' s semifinals day.
Which means it can only get better as Peter Colt stares down the racket of Pierre Maroux.
Game point.
Whoa.!
Peter Colt must have had his Wheaties this morning.
He' s off to a roaring start.
But remember, Chrissy, the last time these two met... was in '97 U. S. Open semis, a day I' m certain Peter Colt wants to wipe from the memory banks.
No kiddin '.
It was the greatest opportunity of Colt' s career.
He was up two sets, and then he completely choked.
And I don' t think he' s ever fully recovered from it.
You know, John, choking can be instigated by the smallest thing.
Absolutely.
You wake up in the morning, and something just isn' t right.
Or maybe a little superstition you have goes wrong.
And a seed of self- doubt is planted.
Lizzie.!
Then everywhere you look, that feeling of doubt seems to be looking right back at you.
Once that happens, all it takes is one point.
One decisive point that can make or break your confidence... and completely determine the outcome of a match.
Miss Rupesindhe.
Colt.
Well, there' s no trophy here today on number two court.
Thank you.
And incredibly, just two points away... from the Wimbledon final on Sunday against America' s Jake Hammond.
Come on, Pete.!
Quiet please.
- That was an almost impossible passing shot.
Match point.
- Yes!
And he seems to be having trouble getting up from that awkward tumble just now.
Peter Colt' s clearly in pain.
- Shit.
- It' s hard to tell.
This could spell disaster for the man who' s captured the hearts...
Come on, Son.
Come on.
You can do it.
Mr. Colt, are you okay?
It' s my back.
Can you get up?
Come on.
He can' t actually hear you.
- Oh, yes, he can.
- This is an eerie echo of the Tom Cavendish match.
- Well, he' s back on his feet.
- Oh, yes, he can.
- Oh, my God!
The stress.
How does he deal with it?
How does who deal with it?
My back is killing me.
But remember you' re one point away from the finals.
I' d love to see an English guy in the finals, but give me a break.
Do you remember Australia?
All right!
Peter Colt is the luckiest man in tennis.
This is gonna hurt.
Game, set, match...
Colt wins three sets to love::
6 - 2, 6- 1, 6- 3.
Yes!
I knew he could do it.
Who would have bet, two weeks ago, that the man time had forgotten,
Rabbit.
Caught it messing with your lettuce.
Good man.
Congratulations, Peter.
Can we just do a quickie?
No, not right now.
How' d she do?
It' s just one of those days where I couldn' t do anything wrong, and Lizzie just couldn' t do anything right.
Bugger.
It' s not as if she can blame you, is it?
I told you I needed to focus, to be away from you for just a few days.
But, no, instead you sneak into my room, you don' t even have the decency to spend the night...
- I had the earliest start, and I thought you' d want the extra sleep.
- I was some chick you picked up.
- Well, this chick is going back home to work on her serve.
Lizzie, I am sorry about your match.
But please don' t go.
Because you need to screw me before the finals.
It' s not.
Aha.!
I know you want me to think... that we' re falling in love or some bullshit, but the only thing you fell in love with this week was winning.
- That is absolutely not true.
- Oh, yes, it is.
More than anyone.
- Don' t say that.
- I do.
Love means nothing in tennis.
It only means you lose.
She' s dropping her arm too soon after the toss.
Honestly
Love is shit, just like she said.
Yeah.
He' s absolutely right.
Just ask my soon- to- be ex- wife.
Ask all my ex- wives.
Thanks for the words of wisdom, Ron.
Shouldn' t you be off sucking up toJake?
I took care of that at breakfast.
You gave her a taste ofher medicine.
You' re in the finals.
Ow!
Look, I' m not making any promises, but if you keep relatively still, you should be in a decent state for the finals.
We got it.
Frito- Lay.
- What?
- You are the new spokesperson for their brand- new chip.
Surprisingly Zesty, it' s called.
That' s you, pal.
I' ve gotta get out of here.
No way.
You heard the good doctor.
Let' s get you some room service.
- You Brits got a name for everything, huh?
There' s a distance between us
There' s no turning back
Why, Jennifer?
I move on from this pain
I' m going.
Oh, for God' s sake, Carl.
Carl!
For God' s sake, what...
Didn' t I tell you always to knock before entering a room?
Well, it' s a bit late now.
You better come in and have some breakfast.
What do you want?
Eggs and soldiers?
- Oh, eggs will be fine.
- Sit down.
Morning, Son.
Where' s the marmalade?
Well, uh, I' m out of the tree house.
Yeah, you certainly are.
Your mother and I seem to have found some common ground at long last.
- Oh, really.
What' s that?
- You, Peter.
You' re, uh, probably aware that things have been a bit sticky for the last few, well, years actually.
The fact is that, uh, in the end, the only thing we shared was the downstairs toilet, and she wasn' t really keen on that.
I think what I' m trying to say is that... we' d forgotten just what an inspiration you are to both of us.
That' s meant to be the other way around actually, I know.
But how very proud we are of you.
It' s been a long time since we' ve done this.
Too bloody long.
Dad?
Hmm?
Oh, God.
Well, it' s been quite a fortnight, hasn' t it?
Not just for Peter, but for all of us.
But we could all do better... to love and support each other unconditionally.
Without judgment, without...
- For God' s sake, Carl, stop biting your fingernails.
You' re not a bloody infant!
- Augusta!
- You were saying, darling?
- Yes, I' m sorry.
I just wanted to propose a toast.
Our family.
It' s a trick.
Our family.
Our family.
Oh, bloody marvelous.
We' re bad luck.
If we came and you lost, I would never be able to forgive myself.
I don' t believe in luck anymore.
And I can' t imagine the three of you not being there.
So, please.
So what you' re saying is Jake' s the safe bet then.
Good morning.
It' s Radio 1 at 7: 00.
I' m Chris Moyles.
So today' s the day.
It' s the big finals.
Peter Colt, what an amazing man.
Who would have thought?
BBC London 94. 9.
It is Wimbledon finals day.
I' il try to be detached, I try to be cool, but I' m carried away.
Come on, Colty.!
Good luck, Mr. Colt.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
All the best, Mr. Colt.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
An Englishman in the final.
Fantastic!
If you could win that cup, sir, we' d all be so proud.
I' il do my best.
Ready, sir?
Peter Colt, seen here in his teens, has already declared this to be his last competitive match.
Only a matter of days ago,
Colt had become no more than a fading blip on the radar of tennis history.
Now he' s become the man who...
Not to add the pressure, Peter, but you know the entire United Kingdom is cheering you on today.
Yes.
Well, let' s hope I don' t disappoint them.
Did you have any realistic hope two weeks ago that you would be here today preparing to walk onto...
Lizzie, I love you more than life itself, but I can' t turn off every goddamned television set in the United Kingdom.
I' m going for a walk.
Flight board' s in half an hour.
What do you attribute this remarkable run to?
You were supposed to make a very early exit.
Well, I had a bit of luck against Tom Cavendish in the quarters, and I played a more focused game... passionate game, uh...
I suppose the real answer to your question is, uh, well, love really.
Love of the game?
Yeah, love of the game.
But, listen, you may have read about Lizzie Bradbury and myself... being involved, so to speak.
But, um, I' d like to take this opportunity to set the record straight.
I read the papers this morning, and, uh, they seem to imply... that Lizzie had let me down in some way.
That' s just not the case.
The truth is I let her down.
I' il always be truly sorry.
Listen, I' m not in the habit... of pouring my heart out on television.
I' m not really in the habit of pouring my heart out at all.
Lizzie, sweetheart, something I think you ought to see.
So if this comes out wrong, forgive me.
Lizzie is the reason that I' m here today.
That' s all I really came here to say except thank you.
Thank you, Peter.
I, uh, have a new theory of our life of tennis.
Tell me.
Oh, it' s simple really.
You hit the ball back over the net... as hard and as deep... and as often as possible.
Sorry to disturb you, Peter.
Oh, no.
Thank you, Danny.
I think I' d rather stay here.
Right.
That' s what I told 'em you' d say.
Good luck, my friend.
In a few minutes, Colt and Hammond will be making the walk... through the tunnel onto center court.
A little stroll, Chrissy, that I' m sure you' d agree is about the number one highlight of a tennis player' s career.
Except for the butterflies I always felt, absolutely.
No, he can' t just wear the hat.
No, we don' t 'cause we don' t have an endorsement deal.
Well, then he knows the number.
Peter.
I tried to warn you about her.
By the way, how' s the weak back?
Thanks.
How' s the weak mind?
Gentlemen.
Fuck a duck.
Jake Hammond has been on an absolute tear.
Hewitt, Federer.
Well, with the exception of Dragomir and Tom Cavendish,
But he' s played some great tennis.
But my guess here is that he' s more than a little overmatched today.
First set.
Hammond to serve.
Peter!
Peter!
Peter!
Ladies and gentlemen, quiet please.
Play.
15- love.
Yes, thanks.
I' il be needing that.
He said, "Thanks.
I' il be needing that. "
- Quiet please.
- Go, Jake!
Come on, Jake.
30- love.
40- love.
Oh, that poor kid.!
He was on the receiving end of one of the fastest- recorded serves in professional tennis.
144 miles per hour.
Well, we certainly hope he' s all right.
And that reminds me how lucky I was, Chrissy.
I ball- boy' d in the old days when they used wood rackets.
And things were a lot slower.
- Or maybe not.
- Colt to serve.
Love- 40.
Hammond.
40- love.
Hammond.
30- love.
Hammond.
New balls, please.
Love- 15.
Hammond leads five games to two.
Hammond.
15- 30.
15- 40.
Peter Colt finds himself once again at break point.
He really can' t afford to go down another break this early in the third set.
He seems completely lost out there, John.
Lost and confused.
We may be witnessing... the near total collapse of a player' s game.
Please, God.
Game...
Play suspended.
What are you doing, lad?
Get in here.
It ain' t over till the handshake, lad.
Danny, I' m not really in the mood for a pep talk right now.
Hi.
I thought you' d gone.
Me too.
Having a tough day?
Sorry.
Why are you British apologizing all the time?
Don' t apologize to me.
I love you.
Apologize to the people who are rooting for you out there.
What' d you say?
I said that the whole country has been waiting...
No.
The other bit.
I said I love you.
See, that' s very good news.
I thought I was alone in the love department.
Well, turns out you' ve got company.
I am so sorry.
If you say sorry one more time, you' re going to be sorry.
I meant about the other night.
Shh!
Stop it.
Forget about that.
This is about you.
Go out there and decide who you are.
And who might that be?
Please be patient, Mr. Hammond.
Please sit down.
The question is, where' s Peter Colt?
Did he flee the building with the rain?
I think he' s in the lavatory.
Is it?
They are allowed one.
If he' s got a jumpy tummy.
So, if he doesn' t come back...
He' s gonna lose.
I do.
But he' s just better than me.
He' s not.
I' m two sets down.
My back' s killing me.
I' m too tired.
My legs are like lead.
Find a second wind.
It' s what winners do.
No, it' s not.
It' s a bundle of tells.
- What?
- His serve.
It' s like a book.
You just have to know how to read it.
You know I really don' t care who wins.
I mean, I represent both players.
It' s like asking me which one of my kids I love more.
Which one of my kids do I love more?
I' il talk to you later.
Well, Peter Colt is back.
Let' s hope he' s better.
So far this match has been a blowout.
Peter!
Ladies and gentlemen, as play resumes, Hammond leads... two sets to love and one game to love.
Hammond to serve.
Play.
Go, Pete.!
Ifhe bounces the ball once instead of twice, he' s going for the body.
Ifhe shifts back on his left heel and shows you his toe, it means he' s hitting deep.
Colt sure seemed to have Hammond' s number on that one, Chrissy.
Which is a good sign ifhe' s gonna climb out of the giant hole he' s dug himself.
Ouch.
You all right?
Yeah.
Welcome back.
Same to you, sir.
Station ident ready to roll.
Eight, top of your shot.
John, did you see who just came in?
That' il give an immediate adrenaline burst.
- Yes!
- He did it, Chrissy.
Oh!
After a great comeback in the third set, Colt' s game has leveled.
And he and Jake Hammond are even at 5- all in this tie- break.
Come on, Peter!
5- 5 in the breaker.
Here we go.
Hammond.
Jake Hammond is up 6- 5 in the tie- breaker, and he' s finally gotten himself a championship point.
This could be the final point of Peter Colt' s pro career.
Right here, right now.
- Ladies and gentlemen, quiet please.
- This could be it, Chrissy.
Or is it the toss?
I - I- If he tosses high, i- it...
Oh, sod it!
- 6- all.
- Incredible point.
I' m doin' a complete 180 on Peter Colt.
This is amazing persistence from thejourneyman player.
I was already thinking about gettin' to the airport.
We may be going to a fifth set, and if I was Jake Hammond,
I' d want to close this thing out right now.
The last thing he wants is another set with the momentum going in the other direction.
First one to win by two.
Ladies and gentlemen, quiet please.
Colt.
Wow.
A double fault.
Peter Colt now has set point to force a fifth and deciding set.
Aw, give us a goddamn break!
Please, shut off all mobile phones.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Unbelievable.!
Advantage...
Rising star Peter Colt has battled back.
Colt.
Game point.
Colt leads five games to four.
Final set.
Well, Colt has broken Jake Hammond.
And after this changeover, he' s gonna be serving for the Wimbledon title.
Listen, an hour ago, I didn' t think he' d find anybody to give him a ride home.
I mean, he' s finally got a chance to serve out the match.
Time.
Break you right back, asshole.
Did you see that?
That is some definite gamesmanship from Jake Hammond.
Come on, Peter.
15- love.
Come on!
Peter Colt is now three points away from winning Wimbledon.
One point at a time, Peter.
It' s just another point.
You could be the champion of Wimbledon, which means you wouldn' t have to take the pro job for starters.
Lizzie could help with that.
Oh, God knows what taste she has.
Oh, shut up, you silly ponce.
30- love.
Make that two points away, Chrissy.
- Ladies and gentlemen, quiet please.
Oh, my God.
Come on, Pete.
30- 15.
Chrissy, we talked about Colt' s reputation in the past... as a choker when it comes to big points.
Well, this is primo choke time.
I wouldn' t be surprised if Colt got real tight now.
Thank you.
Peter.!
Peter.!
Don' t choke.
Please don' t choke.
I' m not gonna choke, damn it.
40- 15.
Do you believe it?
Peter Colt is serving a championship point.
Quiet please.
Ladies and gentlemen, quiet please.
- Out.
- 40- 30.
- I don' t believe it.
- No!
- What the hell?
- What?
- Look at the chalk fly.
The ball was definitely in.
- It was on the line.
- It was on the line!
I' d be torching the stadium about now.
Excuse me!
The ball was good.
Oh, come on.
In.!
He' s done it.!
He has done it.!
You bet on Jake?
Can I retire now, Mum!
Certainly not!
Augusta!
There' s so much I want to say to you.
Oh, yes, you are.
That dream finally come true.
What else could ever come close?
Except this, maybe.
I did take a job at a club.
Yeah!
The ball was in.
Well, most of the time.
But the truth is, it was reallyjust beginning.
Oh, and by the way, Lizzie did win the U. S. Open.
And Wimbledon.
Twice.

But I feel high
I was lucky.
I came from the most beautiful place on Earth...... where music was everywhere.
And people believed there was no difference...... between being awake and dreaming.
For as long as I could remember, I wanted to be a musician.
That' s my mother.
She' s the one who taught me how to sing.
That' s me.
Whenever I heard her voice, all I wanted was to be held in her arms...... so I could be closer to the source of the magic.
When my mother suddenly died...... I felt like everything around me had died too.
I couldn' t feel anything anymore.
The only thing that kept me going were the letters from Uncle Alfonso.
He' d gone to Los Angeles and made it big in the restaurant business.
He said the streets really were paved with gold if you worked hard enough.
I didn' t know what to do, so I asked my grandfather, a very wise man...... what he thought.
And he told me that all of life is a dream...... and I should choose my dreams carefully...... because they' re very powerful things.
Los Angeles, City of Angels.
Well, yet to unfold.
Who would' ve thought I' d end up like this?
It turned out that Uncle Alfonso wasn' t the taco king of L. A.
He didn' t even own the place.
But he was the assistant manager and he did get me this job...... so I shouldn' t complain, but I can' t take those hats.
Okay.
- Hello.
What can I do for you?
I' il have a Happy Burrito combo with extra cheese.
And she doesn' t even know that I exist.
- To go.
Absolutely.
Hi there, baby doll...... angel...... precious...... beautiful pussycat.
You make me chase my tail in circles.
Okay, that' s going to be 3. 75.
And I' m really sorry about him.
Yeah, whatever.
That' s 3...... and that' s 4.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
I know it.
Don' t bet on it, taco boy.
Dude, you suck.
You know that women don' t like your macho comments.
What they appreciate is to be spoken to with respect.
Respeto, that' s what it' s all about, chivo.
She was hot.
Didn' t you see that?
I' il be like, "Call me taco boy!
Call me taco boy! "
It' s amazing what depths a person will sink to when they get desperate.
But as long as I could play my music, I didn' t care.
Most people have forgotten about the dreams that brought them here.
But then again, so have I.
Thank you very much.
This next song is "Lonely Girl."
Thank you.
Clean this up.
Thank you very much.
We' re gonna take a short break...... and I' il be right back, so please don' t go away.
Come here.
Wake up.
You guys...... are so losing your Game Boy...... as soon as I get this in the house.
- Gonna give me a hand?
- I' il give you a hand.
I got it.
It' s okay.
- Yeah.
- And where do you live?
- I live next door.
Well, I hope you' re not planning on making too much noise, okay?
Let' s do this right.
- Hi.
- What' s your name?
Mirabela.
- Let' s get started.
I can get the rest.
Just this one will be good.
Hi.
I just wanted to say to you that...... that I' m really sorry about my co- worker' s behaviour the other day.
He' s not very smart sometimes.
- You' re the guy from the taco place.
- Yeah.
I' m Antonio.
- How are you?
Look, I wanted to ask you...... I don' t know if you wanted to go to dinner or dancing this Friday...... I was wondering if you were available to do me the honour?
Is that a date you' re asking for?
I think so.
I' m flattered, but I will have to say no.
- Okay.
I' m sorry.
Maybe some other time.
I' m gonna be there anyway, Friday night at La Zona Rosa...... if you....
- If you change your mind or....
- Okay.
- Bye.
- Thank you.
Who was that?
I don' t know.
Just some guy.
What' s up, uncle?
Antonio, look around this place.
It doesn' t take all these people to roll a burrito.
We have way too many workers.
We' re gonna have to let someone go.
Since you were the last one hired...... l guess you have to be the first one fired.
It' s corporate.
But I' m family!
I' m your blood!
I' m really sorry.
Take it!
Take it!
It' il hold you over...... for a while at least, until you find something else.
You' il be okay, Tonio.
You' re young, you' re strong.
- Sure.
Thanks for everything, uncle.
You know, I would if I could...... but I can' t because I' m a total failure.
So what?
Yeah, but nobody wants to hear my music.
I don' t know.
I' m scrawny, I' m short.
People get tired of being sold the same old thing over and over again.
After a while, they look for something real.
- Yeah, that' s why I took this NPR job.
Oh, the NPR job, right.
Because that pays the big dollars.
Maybe you should enter that contest.
What contest?
It' s only the largest Latino band competition this side of Tijuana.
- I don' t know.
But I' il tell you this:
The winner gets to open a concert for a world- famous mystery musician.
Ten thousand dollars?
Wow.
Ten thousand dollars.
Keep the noise down.
I' m sorry.
If you' re gonna play music...... then play music.
You might wanna hear something from my collection.
I gotta see this.
Let me just see what you have.
- The oldies.
- That' s the good stuff.
Come on.
Come inside, we' il play them together.
No, thanks, I' ve heard them.
I gotta get back to my card game.
What are you playing?
Solitaire?
Oh, come on, by yourself?
Come over here, we' il play the songs.
José José.
You know, my father used to play with him.
He said that José José' s father...... only wanted classical music in the house...... because he was an operatic singer...... and forbade him to play that pop.
- I want to see that.... let' s see if you know who this is.
- Okay, I don' t wanna see it.
- I know how to do this, thank you.
I know that.
That' s Paquita la del Barrio.
Also known as Francisca Viveros Barradas.
- She' s from my hometown.
Yeah.
She sings about getting dumped.
Do you know who this is?
- Perfidia.
That' s Alberto Dominguez, and his Xavier Cugat version.
When they told Xavier Cugat that his music...... was too much middle- of- the- road...... he said, "Well, I' d rather play 'Chiquita Banana'...... and have a swimming pool than play Bach and starve."
- Yes, he did.
- How come you know so much?
- Because I' m a geek, that' s why.
What are you doing?
What are you talking about?
It made the hair on my arm stand up, look at that.
- You should be singing all the time.
- No, I' m too old.
But that was a long time ago.
With my ex, Javier.
Back in Veracruz, we had some really good times.
-... and dumped me.
- You know what...... forget the loss, you know, just be happy that it happened.
Yeah.
I gotta get back to my kids.
Okay.
Making your intention your reality.
My 10- step program for making the intention...... of creating a stress- free, tranquil mind your daily experience.
Remember that your natural state is joy.
That' s Latin America' s best music.
Now settle back...... here' s a groove for you that' s gonna warm up your afternoon.
Look at that.
I' m gonna do it.
- You' re gonna go back to Mexico?
- Yeah, that' s what I' m going to do.
No.
I want to enter the contest.
- I knew it.
- What do you mean, you knew it?
- I knew it.
- But I gotta change my sound.
I can' t do that 18- year- old, hormone- crazed --
I don' t know.
- Why?
- I think it' s young.
- Yeah.
- I don' t know.
I mean, I wanna keep the old- school sound vibe.
You gotta help me find a band.
Help me find some guys I have a chemistry with.
I think I' ve got a couple of guys that could be just the right guys for you.
Okay, we' re back.
Hello?
Hello?
Oh, sorry.
You had a "Help Wanted" sign out there?
Someone' s here for the job.
Raj, I' m right here.
There' s no need to yell, son.
- So you' re looking for a job, huh?
- Yes, sir.
You ever pump gas before?
No, sir.
Well, that' s all right, because we don' t have any gas pumps.
You got the job.
You start tomorrow morning, 8 a. m.
That' s okay, it' s great.
I' il be here a half- hour early then.
- You' re very welcome.
Thanks a lot.
Sorry about that.
It' s all right.
Okay.
- Clumsy fellow, huh?
I like him.
Papá, please eat your food.
Why aren' t you dressed yet?
I don' t think I should leave him.
He' s gonna be fine.
You don' t do anything anymore except study and worry about your dad.
You' re turning into a geek.
Are you gonna be all right without me, Papá?
Sure, mija.
You go out and have fun.
Okay, I' m gonna change really fast.
- Yeah.
- I know.
- Yes.
That' s him, right?
He looks super cute tonight.
- What are you talking about?
He looks like a nice guy.
I' m very sorry.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
May I have this dance with you?
- No, no.
No, don' t look.
You' il see.
Okay, here we are.
All right, you ready?
It looks so small.
Nothing like it feels.
You know, sometimes when I just feel like...... the whole city' s gonna swallow me up...... and I don' t want to crawl on all fours anymore...... I come up here and I feel....
I feel like anything can happen up here.
I can, I don' t know, suck the moon.
I could be president.
What do you wish?
I wish that...... my mother was still alive.
One day...... I told her that...... I would be the first one in the family to be a doctor.
A veterinarian.
And I' il never forget...
... she smiled at me and she said:
"Paloma...... you' re gonna be the best...... veterinarian in the world."
You' re going to be.
I feel it.
No.
Because she' s gone now.
I know, I know.
Oh, my God, you' re beautiful.
Inside and outside.
I' m sorry.
I don' t know, I couldn' t help myself, I....
What?
Come here.
I' il help you into bed.
Papá?
- Hi, Miss Acosta?
- Hi.
Thank you, doctor.
He had a stroke, but it was only a minor one.
He' s gonna need some extra care for a while, but he' s gonna fully recover.
- Thank you.
- This way.
- Stop.
All right, all right.
That is what you do.
I can' t.
You are not over him, are you?
I am so completely over that pig of a man.
You know what I' m gonna do?
- I am gonna do a psychic reading.
- Oh, God, no.
That' s what you need right now.
- And are you ready?
- No.
Here we go.
There' s a man nearby.
- What do you mean, clues?
Well, so that you' il recognize him when you meet him.
First, he will be a great lover of music.
Oh, that' s nice.
Second, he will cherish the colour red.
He will serve you...... the greatest meal you have ever had.
So fabulous that you will scream with joy.
I don' t know.
But either way, there' s food involved, for sure.
When do I meet him?
I don' t know.
Nina.
Nina.
I thought I was gonna lose you too.
Why did you even worry?
You know I wouldn' t leave you.
Not yet, anyway.
You know, Nina...... I died for a minute, and guess what.
I saw Mamá.
Really?
- How is she?
- Oh, she is doing great.
And you know what else?
She says she will wait for me until it' s my time to cross over.
And she will have a big plate of my favourite spicy tamales...... just for me, so I can smell my way to the other side.
That' s sweet, Papá.
Just as long as you' re not planning on having those tamales too soon.
Mamá told me it is not my time yet.
No, it was amazing.
He actually talked to his dead wife.
How did he end up...?
What was the communication between them?
It was tamales.
- Tamales?
- Yeah.
Imagine that.
Now, let' s go.
They' re great, huh?
Nobody knows who they are yet.
But they' re on their way up.
That' s Pancho on the guitar, Enrique on the bass...... and José on the drums.
Hey, Raj.
How long you been together with your girlfriend?
And I' ve known her for about three years.
- Raj?
How did you know that she was the one?
First time I saw her, I knew.
And did she know too?
Are you kidding?
I had to chase her around like some crazy fool.
It' s black and white for us men, no grey stuff in between.
That' s right.
Raj.
How did you hook her?
What did you do?
I bought her a lot of beautiful gifts.
And most importantly, I made her confident I' d be able to provide for her.
Women wanna know that a guy can take care of her...... a guy that can really bring home the bacon.
I say this even though I' m a vegetarian.
- Well, thank you.
- You' re welcome.
Look, I hope I' m not bothering you.
Nothing more.
No, really.
She wouldn' t believe that.
Thank you, mija.
Here, let me close the curtains so you can watch your show better.
I like them open.
Look, I' m not stalking you.
No, why would l?
It' s better like this.
Stop!
- What?
- What was what all about?
The band is not all about you and your guitar.
You have to open them wide up or else it doesn' t sound good.
All right.
Pancho!
Pancho!
You told me you were not the lead vocalist type.
Look....
Look, we came here together for the contest, all right?
And exposure is something...... that each and every one of you needs right now.
So let' s drop the egos...... and let' s get out of the way of the music, okay?
I don' t know what' s wrong with me, man.
I' m sorry, man.
I don' t know what' s wrong with me.
You know what I mean?
I think he plays good.
Well, yeah, I mean, the guy can play.
He doesn' t have the mojo that we need for the band, you know?
Look, guys, just go with me on this one, all right?
- We' re gonna win the $10, 000 -- - Thank you.
We' il open for the mystery musician.
- I just want to play.
We all want to play.
- Come on.
Hi.
I came to see how the two of you are.
I left so many messages.
Hi.
I know.
I haven' t been able to return your calls.
I' ve been really busy with Papá.
That' s not what I meant.
I mean, that' s why I came by, because I wanted to help you.
Well, there' s nothing that you can really do.
I just have to be here.
That' s why he got in trouble in the first place...... because I wasn' t here for him.
But now is when you really need your friends, right?
- I brought you something.
- No, I can' t take it.
I want you to have it.
I can' t.
I can' t be with you, Antonio.
Why?
I just can' t.
Please understand.
Don' t make it harder on me.
X marks the place.
Thank you.
I got some bad news.
They just called.
They' re not coming.
- Quit?
- Yeah.
That' s great.
That' s great.
That' s a really classy move.
Like, three days -- Right before the tryouts!
Tonio.
Come on.
I' il buy you one.
He thinks because he went to the right schools...... he came from a better neighbourhood....
Listen.
I hear you.
Thank you for giving me that.
Always has all those airs.
You guys have any requests?
Requests?
What do you call yourselves?
Los Hermanos Solitos.
"The Lonely Brothers."
Why so lonely, huh?
- We' re all single.
- We have no girlfriends, no wives.
No problem.
Right, that' s how it is.
You have anything original?
You got it.
- I always want something original.
Javier, you wanted me to sign the papers, I signed them.
That' s what you wanted, that' s what you got.
- No way.
But, Javier, look...... don' t forget to be a father to our babies, huh?
You just can' t drop them too.
You can' t divorce your children.
Very good.
Where have you been?
For you.
- They' re red.
- Yes.
I just wanted to thank you for reminding me...... that my world is music.
- I don' t deserve this.
- What, are you kidding?
Don' t ever say that.
Here.
- Come in.
- Oh, no, I can' t.
I gotta go down to Los Lobos and meet my new band.
Do you want to come with me?
- Laundry?
Kids.
Doesn' t look like they' il notice.
- Okay.
But these are so beautiful.
I feel like a queen.
That' s because you are one.
Okay?
- And he walked out of the studio.
That' s what I do.
- What if they don' t like you?
No, no.
- Mirabela.
I wasn' t sure if you were gonna come.
You look beautiful.
Alberto, a. k. a.
El Zorro.
Thank you for coming.
You devilish charmer, you.
I want you to meet the rest of the group.
We have Rafael, el guitarrón.
Welcome.
- Glad you could make it.
- A pleasure.
Mirabela.
And since you' re here, why don' t we...... take this opportunity...?
Now you sing with me, come on.
Nice meeting you guys.
- Thank you.
I don' t know.
- Antonio.
You complete the band.
Did you hear the way the room loved you?
It was just like my mother used to sing.
I' m not your mother.
I' m not that old yet.
That' s not what I meant.
- Look.
I' m not young or sexy anymore.
I do.
I really do.
I just can' t.
Oh, Mirabela.
- Oh, yeah.
I' ve never seen you eat this much, Papá.
I' m a new man now.
I feel so good that I could eat the whole world.
Well, you can start with your breakfast.
Where' s that nice young man you' ve been seeing?
I haven' t seen him around lately.
Since when did you notice such things?
I had a dream about the two of you last night...... and you were very happy together.
Well, that' s nice, but....
I don' t have time for dreams right now.
Our dreams are the most important thing in this life, preciosa.
Mirabela?
Come on in.
I' m back here.
Where?
So, what else do you do besides laundry?
Housecleaning.
- What thing?
- Hey!
Give me that.
- You want your laundry?
- Have you lost your mind?
- No, I wanna help you regain yours.
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, God.
- I hate the thought of even doing it.
You love it.
It' s your whole soul.
Oh, God.
- What?
- I thought you were different.
- You' re like all men.
You think that all a woman wants to do is play house?
Let me tell you something, okay?
Big ones.
I wanna sing.
I wanna sing in front of Javier, that two- timing cheater...... in front of his girlfriend...... in front of everybody who thinks I' m not thin enough.
In front of the whole damn world.
Oh, my God, yes.
I' m laughing at you.
Because you' re funny to me.
Oh, yes, you are.
You' re very funny to me.
I -- I --
I' m gonna see you at rehearsal, at 5: 00 today.
And don' t be late, okay?
You know how to do laundry.
Five o' clock.
Can I ask you something?
Have you ever been truly in love?
I' m talking about, like, really, really in love?
I thought I was with Javier, but that was something else.
Right, but....
Look, but what if you were in love now, let' s say...... with somebody new today...... how would you tell them?
Who is she, anyway?
Well...... she' s this woman who doesn' t know her own beauty.
And I just -- I don' t know how to tell her.
Well, you don' t tell a woman anything...... just show her.
Show her you love her.
She' il understand.
Not in her head, but in her heart, where it counts.
Is that in a song somewhere?
Hey, come on.
Come on in.
Come on.
Hey, look, I' ve been working on this electronic loop and....
Welcome to the Super Estrella Mystery Musician tryouts.
Welcome to the Super Estrella Mystery Musician tryouts.
Only three lucky bands will advance.
So let' s kick it off with band number one, Bolivar.
What did she say?
She said five minutes.
Five times.
Okay, you can take the 5 to the 110 to the....
That was band number one, Bolivar, straight out of Monterrey, Mexico.
- Let' s hear it for Bolivar.
- Where is she?
Your votes and our judges' votes will be tabulated.
And up next, Las Ultrasónicas.
I' m gonna make them late.
- Do I look fat?
- You look fabulous.
Thank you, babies.
Kiss.
Kiss, kiss.
Enough of that.
You listen to your mom on the radio, okay?
No more food.
- Thank you.
I love you.
- Good luck!
Here she comes.
- Let me see.
You' re gorgeous.
It looks like you guys liked them.
Cartel de Santa is up next.
Where you guys been?
Come on.
Zorro, I' m sorry.
Traffic was terrible.
- Thanks.
- No, no, no.
Looks terrific.
Let' s go.
What an amazing group.
Come on.
Up next, All Star Gringo Star.
What' s the matter?
Come here.
- What' s the matter?
- What if they don' t get me out there?
What do you mean, what if they don' t get you?
- What?
Listen to me.
You' ve got it.
This is gonna be terrific.
Enjoy it.
Get ready.
Come on.
We worked really hard for this, given it everything we' ve got.
Go, go, go.
Hello, 818.
We' re El Gran Colectivo.
- Come on in.
- So is it hard being in a band?
You know, performing in front of all those people?
I usually do it in front of my family and friends...... but I guess there' s a first time for everything.
- Let' s not talk about it.
- No.
Thank you.
You.
You.
What are you gonna do with the...?
- Dr. Lopez!
- How you feeling?
- You look terrific.
- Hey, how are you?
Who' s that guy Nina' s with?
Some doctor.
Looks like someone' s got Nina' s attention.
Good for him.
Not at all.
Make sure you don' t spill.
You don' t look like someone who doesn' t care.
I know I know you from somewhere.
Well, I live two blocks away from you.
- Beatriz.
- Yeah.
I see you almost every evening...... when I come back from work.
- How do I look?
Nina, will you help me make outfits for the band?
Sure.
Zorro, I don' t know, I don' t know.
Nina' s driving me crazy.
My mind' s on fire.
You' il be fine.
- Hey.
That' s me.
What can I do for you?
- Yeah?
We' d like to talk about your career.
We think you' ve got potential.
Well, thank you.
That' s very nice of you to say.
There' s a great deal of talk lately from the major record labels...... about recruiting a fresh, new Latin talent.
A solo act to be the next big crossover.
- But I' m not a solo act.
Playing mainstream songs in English.
I don' t know, maybe you have the wrong guy.
- Okay.
I' il be right back.
- Of course.
You really do look gorgeous, you know?
It would look a lot better on you.
No way.
I' m too skinny.
I wish I could have some nice curves like you do.
I' m a stick.
We' re never satisfied, are we?
I' ve decided that I don' t need a man.
But there is...... someone that you' re crazy about, isn' t there?
Why do you say that?
I saw you and Antonio at the party.
I' m not ready to get serious with anyone.
Do you love him?
I don' t know.
He loves you.
Really?
Oh, I' m sure of it.
-... and set you up as a solo act.
But I already have a manager.
Look, I know your manager, and he' s a really nice guy...... but he hasn' t been in the game for years.
He just can' t do for you what we can.
You know, Antonio, sometimes you just have to forget about the past.
This is a fast- paced industry.
If you don' t grab your chance when it comes around, you get left behind.
- Yesterday' s news.
I mean, to be honest with you...... it has always been my dream to just make an album.
You really think so?
I still have a chance?
We wouldn' t be here if we didn' t.
Sure.
This one is on us.
- I got it.
- Thank you.
I' il take it over there for you.
- Well, thank you for coming.
- It' s okay.
I mean, they' re not dirty, they' re just greasy.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
- Here you go.
- What' s up?
So you got a record deal, huh?
- Maybe.
- Well, good for you, man.
- Can we talk later?
We' re late.
Please, I gotta talk to you.
If you were me...... and all of a sudden you had opportunities you worked so hard for --
When we' re done...... you' il have more than you ever know.
No, I know, but listen to me.
-... that you really wanted -- - Listen.
Let me tell you something.
This is the reason I became a manager to begin with...... to bring beautiful music to the world.
We' re gonna bring boleros back to life.
Are you excited?
Come on.
Let' s go.
I had a sofa made out of this material.
You look wonderful.
- No.
You look very handsome.
Thank you.
No.
Oh, my goodness, she looks beautiful.
We' re back with Pancho from All Star Gringo Star.
Do you think you got a good chance?
Yeah, I think we do have a really good chance.
Now you told me earlier...... that the contest has generated so much publicity...... that there' s talk of record industry interest.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, not for us, unfortunately, just yet.
But I did hear that the lead singer from El Gran Colectivo...... is signing up with a new manager...... and is going solo right after the contest, so....
So he' il be going out on his own?
Yes, the best of luck for him.
You are too kind.
Thank you very much.
- Antonio, we need to talk to you.
- What is this we hear in the news...... that you have a new deal with a new manager?
And that you' re going solo?
How could you do that to us?
- I' m really sorry.
I should' ve told you what was going on.
- Yeah, what' s going on?
- I feel really bad.
- Oh, please.
- No, Mirabela, wait.
And let me tell you, it was really tempting, but --
Just don' t do it behind our backs.
Our music is all of us.
- Of course I' m sure.
Because I don' t have a big office downtown.
Who cares about a big office downtown?
Those big- office people never believed in me like you did.
And what happened to:
- Okay.
All right.
How are you?
- Guess what.
- I' m going to vet school.
I' m so happy for you.
That' s everything you wanted, right?
It' s great.
Sorry for what?
I think I' ve been really stupid.
You couldn' t help but be stupid.
I' m just kidding.
I mean, what' s important right now...... is that you become everything your mother said you should become.
But...... what about us?
What about us?
You think that...... maybe we can...... start again where we left off?
But why?
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don' t.
Yes, you do.
You' re gonna go off to vet school...... find some vet and do some animal experiments.
Dissect animals and....
Thank you for shutting me up.
- Really?
My name is Marco Mendez from Super Estrella...... and welcome to the Mystery Musician Contest.
Tonight, one lucky band is gonna be named the winner...... and will open for the mystery musician next week.
Because that band...... is gonna walk off with $10, 000 cash today.
Zoé!
So...... how' s everybody feeling?
Have you seen how many people are out there?
- Three hundred people.
Nothing.
I' m not gonna lie to you, this is a big night.
But all those people out there...... they' re your friends, they' re your family, they' re your supporters...... they' re on your side.
You gotta forget about competing.
This is about doing what it is that you do.
You play.
Yeah.
- That' s right.
They' il feel that.
Trust me.
- What' s up?
I wanted to know, why did you do that to me on the radio?
Look, man, I....
This whole thing just got out of hand.
I guess I wanted it all.
Maybe I was expecting too much, I don' t know.
Yeah, well, don' t expect too much and you won' t regret too much.
Okay, now give it up for All Star Gringo Star.
I' m just gonna take a little peek at the crowd.
Oh, no, no, no.
Don' t let the crowd psych you out.
Mirabela.
Javier.
That bastard.
She' s so...... young.
So...... skinny.
I can' t.
What' s the matter?
- Why not?
No, you sing the song.
I told you not to let the crowd get to you, didn' t l?
-... and he' s with her.
- Oh, God.
I' m not gonna let you do it, okay?
This means so much to you, and you mean so much to me.
I do?
You made me believe in myself.
I did?
Absolutely.
Thank you.
Oh, it' s okay.
Is everything okay?
We' re on in, like, very soon.
Her ex is out there.
- That' s bad?
- Her ex is out there.
That' s bad.
Oh, right.
- Listen, he' s....
- Yeah.
- A real loser.
If he did not know what a good thing he had when he was with you...... then he' il never find out.
That' s right.
Get up on that stage and show him what you' re made of.
I don' t say much...... but you were born for this moment.
Now you get up there and you be fantastic for you.
- For yourself.
And now let' s give it up for El Gran Colectivo!
- Yeah.
- Yeah!
Hello, Los Angeles.
We' re El Gran Colectivo...... and this next song is a pretty song...... that I want to dedicate to somebody very special to me.
Ladies and gentlemen, we' re gonna recount the votes...... and we' il be right back, so don' t go away.
I just want everyone to be ready for whatever happens...... because this is gonna be very, very close.
Let' s just....
It doesn' t matter.
We have the most important thing, right?
We have each other.
- To the winners.
Antonio' s right, because before this contest, I was solito...... and I met a beautiful girl and I have beautiful friends.
You know, it' s true, if it wasn' t for this contest...... I never would' ve met you, Mirabela, my beautiful corazón.
What?
I' ve been crazy about you from the first moment I saw you.
I didn' t know you felt that way.
Thank you.
Allow me.
If you believe you' re a winner, then you are.
- To the winners.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the mystery musician:
El Señor José José!
Thank you very, very much.
I would like to introduce to you right now...... the winners of the Mystery Musician Contest:
El Gran Colectivo!
And now allow us to sing to you...... a very special song.
In the end, winning or losing didn' t matter.
Because together, we made something greater...... than if we each had stayed on our paths alone.
And isn' t that the beauty of life?
The love that we give and receive.
Our dreams are very powerful things.
Adam?
Sorry I' m late.
Call me lvan.
I' m a bit flustered but I' ve been looking forward to meeting you.
Let' s get going.
Let me take your bag.
Come on.
People who have been in prison are often a bit protective of their stuff.
Have you lived in the country before?
This is our small church.
Just take a look at this.
This is our apple tree.
There are lots of apples this year.
It' s probably because of the warm summer.
Don' t eat that.
Come with me.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Adam will stay with us.
This is Khalid and Gunnar.
I won' t talk to egghead.
There will be lots of time for that kind of talk.
Come on, Adam.
What does the O stand for?
In Adam O. Pedersen?
What' s the story about the O?
Your parents must have told you.
- I forgot to ask.
- That' s a good answer.
It says here that you' re a neo- Nazi.
Are you really?
It' s not the first thing that springs to mind by looking at you.
Here it says you' re EVlL.
It' s rude to write that on a person' s CV.
Are you really evil?
I didn' t think so.
We don' t believe in that.
If you only look for evil then the world is evil.
That makes everything easier.
In later years the Devil has sent his troops to test us -
- but we have conquered them all.
All of us here have found God in some way.
I saw that you did.
He was just to stay three months, but he chose to stay.
Gunnar was what you would call an alcoholic.
- and is studying theology.
He' s not the only one.
There' s also Khalid.
He used to rob gas stations.
- No.
- Khalid is still not allowed at Statoil.
A few hostage dramas later he' s learning Danish and is doing well.
Tell me what I have to do.
I can' t do that.
You have to discover that for yourself.
All I want is for you to set yourself a goal.
Are you listening to me?
Yes, I believe I am.
In any other situation I would say that you are rude -
What do you want your goal to be?
I would like to bake a cake.
Bake a cake?
Oh, an apple cake?
Yes, an apple cake.
- My goal is to bake a big apple cake.
- With the apples from our garden?
- Yes, the apples from the garden.
- That' s a good idea.
I think we found your goal.
You' il look after the tree until 1 st of August.
Then you' il use them to bake an apple cake.
I just wanted to give you this.
It has both the old and the new testament.
It' s a good thing to have.
Sleep tight.
- and it can be difficult to tell them apart and choose sides.
Especially these days where so many things are said in this and that town.
Everything has so many nuances.
Also we humans.
- the queen would be in front, the rooks would be crooked -
- and the pawn would be the main piece.
We no longer know who we are and this rootlessness...
Are we boring you, Poul?
Is the word of God boring to you?
- Are we boring you?
- I need to go to the loo.
- Can' t it wait?
- Not really.
We finish in 20 minutes.
- I think that Poul can wait that long.
- So we can song sing now.
- Okay, democracy has spoken.
Go, Poul.
Go take a crap.
- But you can' t come back in.
- That' s okay.
You have to use the hospital loo because you can' t use ours.
- Why not?
- It' s locked during the service.
- Why?
- For security reasons.
Let' s continue if it' s okay with Poul.
We' il sing 634 "You know my heart".
There' s fried pork.
It was a good sermon today.
At least it was shorter than usual.
Too bad for old Poul Nordkap.
Ivan is always on his case.
It' s not nice of him.
He always does that.
It' s because he was in a concentration camp during the war.
He' s 86.
It won' t be any fun when that age comes.
Don' t worry about lvan.
He' s okay.
Just don' t venture into an argument with him.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Me?
- My phone!
- I thought you were sleeping.
And my wallet!
Are you stealing my stuff?
Have you gone insane?
- I' m sorry.
- Piss off, fatso!
- Sleep tight.
- Piss off!
- They' re not moving.
- They cheeky for sake of fuck!
Fly home bird for sake of fuck!
What are we going to do?
There won' t be any apples left for your cake.
Let the paki monkey climb up and shoo them away.
- I' m not talking to you.
- I don' t know anything about birds.
What do we do in a case like this?
You leave them alone, I think.
- Can' t we let them eat the apples?
- They' re Adam' s apples for the cake.
- For sake of fuck, he can' t bake.
- You don' t know that.
If Adam wants to bake us a cake it' s our job to support him.
- I can tell.
- What the fuck do you know, paki?
That' s the right attitude.
That kind of attitude will get us some cake.
- There' s more of them coming.
- That' s just plain rude.
That' s good.
- No bird will come back now.
- Reverend Fjeldsted?
Yes?
Call me lvan.
- Hi.
This is my assistant Adam.
I' m not from around here.
I wanted to come to the service but I couldn' t.
Don' t apologise.
You only cheat yourself.
What' s this?
You' re in a bad way.
Let' s go inside and talk.
- The milk has gone bad.
- Fine.
- Me too.
- No, you didn' t.
Are you?
This may be the right time and place.
John says:
"He came to Canaan after having turned water into wine."
Jesus said:
Don' t call me inconsiderate.
- It' s okay.
I don' t take milk.
- Maybe we have some cookies.
Adam, could you go see if there' s a few cookies for Sarah and me?
- Maybe I shouldn' t have come.
So you met a guy?
I have been in Indonesia working for the World Wide Fund for Nature.
I made love to a man and got pregnant.
I used to drink a lot before.
Now I' m in AA and I' ve been sober for 341 days.
Now they' re saying that the baby may be handicapped.
- I don' t know where the dad is...
- Just a second, Sarah.
Why do I get three cookies and Sarah only two?
Don' t you find that odd?
Hers looked bigger.
I don' t think so.
Have you measured the cookies?
He never does that.
Let' s stop this discussion.
- Yes...
There' s a 60% chance that the baby is handicapped.
I have to decide within a week before it' s too late.
I can' t handle a handicapped child.
60 per cent is a lot, right?
It' s just statistics.
When we were expecting our son we were told that he could be disabled.
We could have been intimidated by statistics and reason -
- but we chose to look at the bright side, and now...
- we' re happy that we chose to have him.
You won' t find anyone to say otherwise.
The Devil is testing us all the time.
We have to make the right choices.
If we all listened to reason the world would be a gloomy place to live.
You need to follow you heart and have the baby.
- Good morning.
Fuck, that hurt!
Why the hell haven' t you turned the cooker off?
This looks bad.
What did reverend Fjeldsted say?
He' s a frigging idiot.
He may be weird, but he' s a good boy.
His life sure as shit hasn' t been easy.
Everything went wrong from the start.
His mother died giving birth to him.
- Ivan?
They took lvan away?
No, nobody took lvan away.
Henning.
Why?
He was fucking those kids black and blue.
They could hardly walk.
- Shut up and fix this.
- Pardon my forthrightness.
I' ve learned it' s best to tell it like it is.
You' re best served by being told the truth.
The cooker bit you?
- Gunnar forgot to turn it of.
I' d like to talk to you.
Do you know why all this is happening?
Why are all these birds in the tree?
And the cooker.
Why did you burn yourself all of the sudden?
I think someone is trying to tell you that you shouldn' t go near the cooker.
You can' t bake a cake without a cooker.
I think Satan is testing us.
By not letting me bake the cake?
He' s trying to fight us.
He' s testing your strength to withstand him.
Look at your hand.
Nobody is doing anything.
- Gunnar just forgot to turn it off.
- He always makes sure to turn it off.
- Hey, fat and drunk!
So many accusations, but there may be an explanation.
You should know that he was the best Danish tennis player in his youth.
He won all his matches but then a ball was mistakenly called to be out.
Gunnar lost and everything went downhill.
What about Khalid?
This was in his coat pocket.
- What are you saying?
- You' re a joke.
- Let' s forbid people to wear hats.
- It' s a balaclava during summer.
- Khalid is from a hot climate.
- Here' s fucking 17, 000 in cash.
- You' re reaching, Adam.
Khalid is saving to buy new clothes.
You didn' t know.
Give me my phone and my wallet or I' il smash your face in.
That' s not fucking mine!
Stay away from my stuff.
Do you understand?
You' re lucky that I' m going back in because I would beat you every day.
- I' m going to the casualty room, - Will you pass the market?
- I could.
- Could you get my cough syrup?
- Sure, what' s it called?
- Von Osten.
Think about what we can do about the birds, if you have time.
Here you go.
It can' t be traced but throw it away anyway.
Can you shoot with that hand?
He' s fucked up.
- Now he' s all turn the other cheek.
- But you' re getting out in 11 weeks.
We' re waiting for you.
- I' m not going to shoot him.
- I just want to understand.
Does it involve the pear pie?
Espen says you talk about a pie.
It doesn' t matter.
I said that I would bake a cake and the idiot won' t let up.
He says that the Devil is testing us because birds are eating the apples.
Do you need help?
Who the fuck do you think you' re talking to?
See you.
Go on.
Get them!
Don' t be afraid.
Get them.
- He' s making them nervous.
- They care fucking not about the cat.
- Yes.
Lambert is not working.
My granddad had a cherry tree.
It was attacked by birds, so he shot a few in the morning and evening.
Shot them?
With a gun?
No, a waffle iron.
Of course it was a gun.
What gun?
One like this.
I think that we should try it.
Can you take them from there?
For sake of fuck, why you not said?
- Lambert?
Lambert, are you okay?
What just happened?
He' s dead.
- It was a shit cat anyhow.
- He shot my cat.
It was an old cat.
He just happened to fall down while we were shooting.
Okay.
We talked about your grandfather.
I think it' s going to be a good day.
It' s too bad that Khalid won' t come in when we' re making his favourite food.
- Where did he get the gun?
- Is he a terrorist?
You should see his dream house.
It' s really nice.
With a bit more Statoil money he can go home.
- Why not just rob a bank - Khalid is very committed to politics.
He only robs multinational companies.
That' s why he robs Statoil.
Statoil stole his father' s land for the oil.
Khalid is taking back his property.
- No, I don' t think so.
- Statoil is Norwegian!
- Remember to tell Khalid that.
- Yes.
Ivan just want him to be calm.
Ivan is not exactly normal.
The anniversary of his wife' s death is coming up.
- He had a wife?
- Yes, Linda.
She ate some pills and killed herself because they got a handicapped son.
He' s got cerebral palsy.
He can' t move at all.
She couldn' t take that.
Can I come in?
Adam, there sure is no shortage of recipes for apple cake in this world.
It looks like we' ve won round one.
Your father?
- That' s Hitler.
No, Hitler had a beard.
You' re right.
I' m thinking of that Russian guy.
I' il leave you to it.
Hitler' s enemies didn' t take him seriously either.
That' s just plain rude.
- he was a bigger Nazi than anyone.
Why do you think they ask me to cheer him up?
Sure.
He was working there.
He met Goblins and all those folks.
- Goebbels?
- He was probably also there.
Then we can see who takes who seriously.
Deal?
I' m glad that you could make it.
He won' t last through the night.
I broke it to him gently.
Well, let' s give him a good sendoff.
- How' s the hand?
- Okay.
What about the honker, lvan?
It took quite a beating.
You don' t have to waste money on perfume anymore, lvan.
Yes.
Come on, Adam.
What' s up with you, Poul?
Have you lost your appetite?
- I' ve brought a guest for you.
Adam Pedersen.
- Are you feeling a bit low?
- I' m scared.
What have you been up to?
- Don' t make them.
I don' t deserve it.
They have been nagging Poul because of this past but we put a stop to that.
Has Miriam been nicer to you?
Yes, she made me hot chocolate yesterday and tucked me in.
- They are all so nice to me.
- That' s good.
Don' t be upset.
- Everybody deserves to be tucked in.
- Did she fluff your duvet and pillow?
There, there.
I apologise for trying to cheat.
I just don' t like being inside the church.
- That' s all forgotten now.
I' m scared, lvan.
I dare not sleep.
You have nothing to worry about.
Let' s focus on the people who cares for you and all your lovely memories.
Poul, don' t cry anymore.
Don' t be so hard on yourself.
All has been forgiven.
If you only knew what we did...
All those poor people.
- It can' t be forgiven.
- Stop it.
Nobody remembers anymore.
Oh God!
Stop your whinging.
It' s not as bad as all that.
We all make mistakes but we don' t let it bring us down.
You' re crazy, man.
Why do you say that?
Why spoil the mood by being plain rude?
Let' s focus on the word of God.
God forgives all, Poul.
God forgives all.
It' s difficult.
Even though you seen it before it' s still difficult every time.
- Yes, I talked to lots.
- A wife' s suicide must be painful.
- Yes, that can' t be nice.
- Linda didn' t take her own life.
- But she took pills?
Yes, but it was an accident.
Accident how?
Christoffer had been playing with her pills and had put them in a candy dish.
Linda always had a sweet tooth and she thought they were yellow M& Ms.
Your son Christoffer?
- So he' s actually able to move?
- Why wouldn' t he be?
- No, I wish.
There' s no stopping him.
Just yesterday he was playing rounders.
I don' t believe you, lvan.
- I just don' t.
- I' ve never heard anything that crazy.
Has Gunnar told tall stories and played fast and loose with the truth?
If it is that' s just plain rude.
Why don' t you bring him tomorrow?
He' s already coming.
- Good.
- Then you can see for yourself.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Christoffer, this is Adam.
Adam, Christoffer.
Yum, eggs.
Small mouthfuls.
- He' s paralysed.
- What did you say?
- I have to go in tower.
- You two stay here.
- I need shoot black bird.
- Sit down.
He' s paralysed.
Christoffer, go into daddy' s office.
This will not be pleasant to watch.
He' s paralysed.
Isn' t he paralysed, lvan?
Is he really, Adam?
Yes, he has cerebral palsy.
That is just crazy.
Khalid, what do you have to say?
Khalid?
Him is it.
Ivan, he' s spastic paralysed.
Your son' s a spastic.
Your wife killed herself.
Your dad raped you.
Look at me, lvan.
Look at me.
You bleeding from an ear.
You bleeding from an ear, for sake of fuck!
The other way.
- Ivan was bleeding from an ear.
- That has happened to me.
Plenty of milk.
Just give up, lvan.
There' s something you should know.
I' m the first to admit that he' s been a bit sluggish lately.
- Shut the fuck up!
- If he hurts you turn the other cheek.
God is on my side.
What is his problem?
He needs to be locked up!
I' m not one to gossip -
- but he' s always been considered a phenomenon.
- I don' t know if you know?
- How the hell should I know?
- He' s sick.
Very sick.
- I bloody well know that.
No, not like that.
Well, he is that too -
- but he' s terminally ill.
- What' s wrong with him?
He has a brain tumour the size of a volleyball.
I' ve never seen anyone with such a large brain tumour.
I' il bash your face in if you call him a walking miracle.
Have you heard about the Ravashi syndrome?
- who lost both his feet in a go- kart accident in 1957.
In a state of shock over the accident he ran home on the stumps of his legs.
His brain blocked the fact that he had no feet.
- He kept his midfield position.
- Without feet?
They were a bad team.
They were maybe in the fifth league.
- that he needs to find an explanation in order to live with it.
That' s why he thinks that the Devil has it in for him.
Ivan would say that everything is a test.
You' re a test, his cancer is a test, his son' s handicap is a test.
In lvan' s mind he' s locked in fierce battle with the Devil himself.
Ivan has no mind to lose and he blocks out everything like Ravashi.
He' s in denial about all the bad stuff.
Death, mutilation, hardship, evil.
That simply doesn' t exist in lvan' s world.
Why does he bleed from his ears?
We have asked ourselves that.
I think it' s when something comes too close.
Someone once got through to him.
He bled from his ears once before.
That was three years ago.
- What happened?
- You don' t know his sister Katinka.
A total slapper.
She fucked everybody.
I even fucked her when she was here to have her adenoids removed.
When she died lvan almost fell to pieces.
He bled from his ears and got sick.
- What happened then?
- You know lvan.
A few days later he was jolly as ever.
You could kill him by making him understand?
Yes, in theory.
Give up, Adam.
God is on my side.
Never forget that.
Hi.
The cooker is broken.
- I wanted to make Christoffer a pizza.
- Let' s fix it.
- We' il get by.
- Where did Christoffer go?
- He' s in your office with a woman.
She' s quite upset.
Her name is Sarah and she' s a real hottie.
When she saw Christoffer she started screaming.
She didn' t want coffee.
Well, we' d better...
So nice of you to visit again.
- Has he been good?
I can' t because this is Christoffer.
Have you two been introduced?
- Say what kind of things?
You said that nothing was wrong with him.
Yes, he can.
Even the complicated kind.
Adam, maybe you should go get some of the cookies that Sarah likes.
I' il come too.
Is anyone hungry?
We' il see if this one lasts a bit longer.
- What are you doing?
- Gunnar is good.
- But you' re pregnant.
- It' s a bit late for that.
- About what?
- The tigers in the Orient.
Here they write that there' s only 400 left.
That' s a sure way to make them extinct.
- Like last round at the pub.
- What do you do then, Gunnar?
- You buy a pint an a chaser.
- The fuck you do!
Gunnar is right.
We have to do something.
- Shut up, man!
- Stay out of it.
Yes, Adam, stop disturbing us because we' re busy.
- Five tigers is dying every day.
Six tigers a day, Adam.
They can really jump high those tigers.
I' il come right out and say it.
You better come with me.
There' s a new apple problem.
Shall we say in five minutes by the tree?
I look fruit and see worm.
No, I actually discovered it, but I don' t need any credit.
For sake of fuck, is on all fruit.
That' s just plain rude.
Yes, Adam, it never stops.
Let' s do something about it.
Take down the sick fruit and spray the rest.
Gunnar, come with me.
We have to arrange Poul' s return to God.
- lived a long and full life.
In his life Poul learned that to know God you must dance with the Devil.
If any Poul Nordkap surely did that.
Poul learned that it' s futile to fight good because -
- he realised in the end that this was just a mere moment.
The world continued and good prevailed as always.
That' s why Poul can return to God with peace of mind.
Adam and I were by his side when he passed quietly away.
"I' m not afraid.
I' m ready. "
But this is not all about Poul -
- because today Christoffer turns nine.
Before we gorge ourselves on cake -
- let' s honour Poul with a hymn.
Kaj Munk' s number 634.
"You know my heart".
There you are.
I thought you had gone to bed.
- I' d like to talk to you.
- Can' t it wait?
It has been a long day for Christoffer with all this attention.
- I' d like to talk to you now.
Go into dad' s office and cuddle up under a blanket.
What' s up with you?
Is the business with the birthday cake?
- What if the Devil isn' t testing you?
What if it isn' t him who' s been dogging you?
I see.
You' re reaching again.
If not the Devil then who?
A little elf?
Maybe all the birds, the cooker and the worms are just a coincidence?
- Is that what you' re telling people?
- God.
- Pardon?
- God.
- I don' t understand.
Why would he do that?
Because he hates you.
I' ve read this book.
Book of Job.
- You' ve read it, right?
It' s about a crocodile.
That' s what I' ve heard.
Yes, it' s about a crocodile, but it' s also about much more.
His seven camels and his ten kids?
He takes everything away from him and makes him a leper.
Does that remind you of anything?
Look at me, lvan!
You know that God is behind this, right?
God is not on your side, lvan.
Yes, he is.
I don' t believe any of this shit.
I just want you to know that it' s God.
The Devil hasn' t wasted any time on you.
God wants to kill you.
You' re just so dense that you don' t get it.
Because I' m evil.
You can' t change that.
There fire in sky.
Him lvan gone?
He forgot moron kid.
For sake of fuck, it was all fresh!
Every night we now go to bed hungry.
You could use him as a crapper.
- No.
Is he going to...
You bet your ass he is.
Why do you think that the bloke began bleeding from all orifices in his skull?
I give him four weeks, five tops.
From a medical point of view it doesn' t matter.
He' s come to his senses.
Somehow you' ve managed to take away his faith.
- That' s why I want to buy you coffee.
- It doesn' t matter.
Well excuse me.
Are you ready?
Get up, lvan, we need the room.
Go with Adam.
Are you coming?
Call me when he gets to weak.
We' il give him a room and a shot of morphine.
God hates us, Christoffer.
He' s always hated us.
It doesn' t look too good.
Gather the others.
Well, the fact is...
Adam already knows but...
I' m dying.
- Die how?
- I' il sleep with the worms.
- Are you not going to stay?
- No, that would be difficult.
What are we to do?
Well, I hope that you...
I don' t know.
I don' t know what you should do.
I don' t know anything anymore.
If I said anything that you can use then do that or don' t.
I don' t care.
That' s all.
- Where you' re going?
I' ve earned that.
- Gunnar...
- Leave me alone.
- Gunnar, that' s stupid.
You had a hair.
Here' s one more.
We have three.
- Ivan deserve good cake.
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I' m picking apples.
- With a paki?
- What happened?
- Lightning.
What' s wrong with you?
Are you fucking kidding us?
- You climb trees with a nigger.
- Esben, just go home.
- He say go away and take fat friend.
Jørgen, let' s teach our little Black friend some manners.
What the fuck are you doing?
I feel stress.
- Here witness.
Him done before.
- He shot me!
- Take him with you.
- You' il regret this.
And you, nigger, you' re dead.
- You stupid?
I have gun.
- You can' t just shoot people.
He came with that shoulder.
There' s his back.
Stop it!
I are off balance.
I no like seeing lvan like that.
It' s a shitty day.
I want leave this faggot country.
You have to talk to him.
He has problems.
Gunnar is also behaving strangely.
They need you.
- Leave me alone.
Yes, but just have a talk with them.
They' il listen to you.
I' il put the apples in the fridge.
Do as you please.
Gunnar, what are you doing?
- Nothing.
- Where' s Sarah?
- She' s gone home.
- What' s with all those things?
- It' s just an aubergine...
- And the racket?
It was in.
Everyone said that is was in.
- Go on in.
- Not while you are here.
Can I see how you live?
No.
- She got very drunk.
Nothing yet.
She just got drunk.
- Put that stuff down.
It' s her fault for getting that drunk.
Let' s go to bed.
You come with me.
- Wow, so many guns.
- Khalid, where are you going?
Statoil must die.
- Wouldn' t you rather stay here?
- No.
- You won' t shoot anyone, right?
I no want to shoot you.
You meddle and I shoot your face.
- Can we go with you?
- You want rob with me?
- So nice.
No.
Get in.
I' il go in first.
I have to use the loo.
Okay, but no shooting anyone before me come in.
Hat on, Gunnar.
Is there a back door?
Get out of here!
Get out!
Run!
- Where' s employee?
- They ran.
For sake of fuck!
- Are you done?
- Don' t you want some cigarettes?
Stop it!
Let' s go!
Are you hurt?
That went well.
You have to talk to lvan.
You need help, both of you.
He also needs help.
Come on.
- Take of that hat.
- Yes.
- Hi.
Where did you go last night?
- We were at the gas station.
- Was I very drunk?
- No, you were nice.
What are you doing?
Where are the other apples?
- We ate them.
- Have you eaten seven apples?
- He was hungry.
You only had beer.
- For fuck' s sake!
You look good in that outfit.
Did we fool around yesterday?
The girlie boys are here again.
There are more.
- Go into the church.
- I no hide from that bunch of faggots.
Look how many they are.
Go into the church.
You can go fuck yourself.
- We just want the paki.
- Will you stop that noise!
I really shouldn' t have come out here and ask for some peace and quite.
I deserve to be able to nap.
I can' t manage you rude people.
Please leave.
We just want the paki and do him.
Do what you want.
You can take him to the woods.
I just want peace.
- Get him!
- That is just plain rude!
We' il do this another way.
Give me everything that makes noise.
What the fuck was he doing?
Asshole!
- I wasn' t my fault.
- Let' s get out of here.
In medical terms this is called a half Kennedy.
In medical terms this is called a half Kennedy.
I can assure you of that.
Well, you just say your goodbyes and I' il stick the kettle on.
It' s for the dead.
Shut up, Gunnar.
So goodbye to you all.
- You could stay.
Ivan may return.
I have to go home.
What you say, Adam.
I don' t know.
You decide.
I sorry about lvan.
I sorry that you can' t make cake.
See you, Adam and the Sarah.
Fuck you, Gunnar.
Well, okay.
- Go to your room.
- Don' t get angry, but...
- Where is that from?
- Don' t hurt me.
I' m sorry.
I' il never do it again.
- Enter.
- Yes.
- Where is he?
It doesn' t make sense.
I believe in figures.
- and don' t go sit in the garden with a cheese burger after having been shot.
- Yes.
He just got up and went for a walk.
The bullet simply shot the tumour away.
Now they' re telling me that the bloke is well again.
I' ve bloody well had it.
Hi, Adam.
- I baked an apple cake.
- Yes.
Should we have a go?
- What' s the name of the child?
- Ivan Lambert Andersen.
Ivan Lambert Andersen...
Amen.
- Thank you.
- You' re welcome.
- Come back.
- No time.
- Interesting.
Because of the tigers?
No, I plan to play tennis again.
They have the best courts.
It' s because of junior.
With his Down' s syndrome he' il just look like the others.
Yes, tigers are really fascinating.
- We have to go.
- Don' t you have to change?
I' il do it in the car.
Come on, Gunnar.
Arne and Noller.
Call me lvan.
This is my assistant, Adam Ole Pedersen.
Well, let' s go.
I' il take the bags.
What the fuck is wrong with your eye?
- What do you mean?
Really?
I think that' s just a rude way to break the ice
We' il come through town so let' s ask what they think of me.
This is not the place for that discussion because you' il lose.
We' il discuss it in the car.
Good idea with that discussion.
How' s that?
Gotta hand it to you, Rico.
The old bean' s working all the time.
- What' il it be, gents?
- Spaghetti and coffee for two.
All right, sir.
"Underworld pays respects to Diamond Pete Montana."
What' s that gotta do with the price of eggs?
Plenty.
Diamond Pete Montana.
He don' t have to waste his time on cheap gas stations.
He' s in the big town doing things in a big way.
And look at us.
Just a couple of nobodies, nothing.
Is that what you want, Rico?
A party like that for you?
"Caesar Enrico Bandello.
Honored by his friends. "
I could do all the things that fella does and more.
Only I never got my chance.
And what' s there to be afraid of?
Why, sure.
Shoot first and argue afterwards.
You know, this game ain' t for guys that' s soft.
Yeah, there' s money in the big town, all right.
And the women.
Good times, something doing all the time.
Exciting things, you know.
The clothes I could wear.
And then I' d quit, Rico.
I' d go back to dancing, like I used to before I met you.
I ain' t made for this sort of thing.
That' s what I wanna do.
Dancing?
Women?
And where do they get you?
I don' t want no dancing.
I' m figuring on making other people dance.
- Oh, I ain' t forgetting about the money.
- Money' s okay, but it ain' t everything.
Be somebody.
Look hard at guys and know they' il do anything you tell them.
Have your own way or nothing.
Be somebody.
- Yeah.
- You' il show them.
- You know...... this was our last stand in this burg.
We' re pulling out.
- Where are we going?
- East.
Where things break big.
So I beat it east, like I told you.
That' s all there is to it.
I wanna run with your mob, if you' il let me.
What do you say?
You won' t be sorry for letting me in.
I' il do anything you say.
I ain' t afraid of nothing.
You think you' re a hard guy?
There' s nothing soft about me.
I don' t quit.
- You got an idea you' re good, huh?
- Give me a chance to show you.
- What do you know about me?
- Oh, I heard plenty.
How you run things this end of town.
About this here Club Palermo, how it' s your front.
- I guess you' re good with a rod too?
- Quick with it and sure.
Well, that don' t go around here.
That' s old stuff.
This ain' t the sticks.
Yeah, I get you.
All right.
You stick around.
And I give all the orders.
And when we split, we split my way.
- And no squawks.
You get me?
- Yeah, sure, Mr. Vettori.
- All right, come on in, meet the boys.
Every one of them.
There' s Tony Passa.
Can drive a car better than any mug in the town.
He' s little, but he' s the goods all right.
Bat Carilla.
Killer Peppi.
Kid Bean.
And this one here, Scabby.
What a smart guy he is.
Boys.
Wake up.
I want you to meet a new guy what' s gonna be with us.
This is...
Caesar Enrico Bandello.
Oh, Little Caesar, huh?
Yeah, sure.
Where did you get the new dancer, De Voss?
Olga brought him around a few days ago.
Not bad.
- All right.
- I' il say he is.
Well, I got hold of a real dancer for a partner, didn' t I, Mr. De Voss?
He' s an elegant dancer.
We' il panic them after a few rehearsals.
Say, you' re not trying to sell him to me, are you, Olga?
Well, young fella, I guess 100 a week ought to buy you.
That' s more than I generally start with.
That' s swell with me, even though it don' t buy no limousines.
Gee, thanks, Mr. De Voss.
You' il never be sorry for this.
Come, Joey.
So it' s you and me from now on.
And I' m not ashamed to tell you.
I guess you know by this time how I feel about you.
That' s all right with you, isn' t it?
A steady, I mean.
Only...
Only, what' s the difference?
This is gonna be real.
- We' il make it mean something.
- Yeah, Joey, let' s.
Awful bad.
- You believe me, Olga?
- I want to believe you.
What' s that?
What you got there, Joe?
What are you doing with that?
Can' t you forget you' ve seen it?
Not between us, Olga.
Don' t worry, baby.
It' s just a little good- luck charm I carry around with me.
Maybe.
I suppose I got no right to ask you, Joe.
But now...
Now that we got an understanding.
Couldn' t you leave it?
No.
I suppose I haven' t got the right.
What would be the good of you asking, kid?
Once in a gang...
- You know the rest.
- I don' t want to know.
Only maybe...
If we try.
I' ve never seen the guy that could get away with it yet.
Seven.
Sam Vettori is still waiting for you in your office.
All right, I guess I' il have to see him.
I wonder what he wants here.
Hey, Ritz.
You' d better stick with me.
I' il need you in there.
- That Sam Vettori' s a no- good lug.
- You said it, boss.
Better let me go first.
Cut that.
Hello, Arnie.
Surprised to see me in your swell joint?
Maybe I won' t be after you tell me what you want here.
Oh, I' il tell you, all right.
Diamond Pete asked me to come up.
He' s coming up too.
- Pete Montana?
- That' s who.
Well, if Pete wants you here, it' s got to be all right with me.
- Hello, Mr. Montana.
- Hello.
Hello.
- Hello, Arnie.
- Hello, how are you?
- Hello, Vettori.
- Hello, boss.
Cigar?
Thanks.
Thanks, Arnie.
Sit down, boys.
I got something to tell you.
A message from the Big Boy.
Now, listen.
Here' s the lowdown.
- The Big Boy says...
- Just a minute, boss.
Hey, you.
Nobody asked you to be butting in here, did they?
- Screw, mug.
- You ain' t giving me orders.
- You' re a fresh guy, huh?
- Take it easy, Rico.
You go out there and wait for me.
Jake with me, boss.
Now, listen, boys.
Watch this guy McClure...... what' s head of the new crime commission.
He' s putting the screws on, and make no mistake about him.
Now, the Big Boy wants me to tell you guys...... to put the chains on your gorillas for the next few months.
Because if any of them go too far, it' il be just too bad.
I' ve never seen nobody the Big Boy couldn' t get to.
He can fix anything.
That' s why he' s the Big Boy.
This bird McClure will be pie for him.
- He' il twist him around his little finger.
- Don' t kid yourself.
Not even the Big Boy.
Small jobs, that' s different.
No, sir.
It' s guys like this torpedo of yours that cause all the trouble.
Who, Rico?
He' s all right.
He' s a little quick on the trigger, but that' s because he' s new.
Yeah?
Well, it' s us that' il swing for him...... if he shoots at the wrong time.
Now, remember what I told you.
Come on.
So long.
And you.
You take it easy with that cannon of yours.
Did you hear me?
Yes, Mr. Montana.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Do yourself a favor, will you, Rico?
Leave your gat home on the piano the next job you pull.
Yeah, park it next to your milk bottle.
Run your own mob, Arnie.
I' il take care of mine.
Yeah, I' il park it.
I don' t need no cannon to take care of guys like you, Mr. Lorch.
Yeah, we gotta be careful.
Little Arnie' s interested in this here nightclub.
- Lf it ever gets out who pulled the job...
- They' il never get wise to us.
They' re careless, but they' ve never been tapped.
Yeah, but I don' t like the whole business.
Neither do I, Sam.
Honest, I don' t.
I couldn' t sleep last night.
I was up worried.
I don' t want to take any chances.
Not now the way they' re closing down on us.
What' s the matter, Tony, getting yellow?
No, but, jeez, none of us wanna hang, do we?
You' d like to quit, wouldn' t you?
You' d like to run out on us.
- You' re yellow, you dirty...
- Wait a minute, Rico.
Where do you get that yellow stuff?
You want to know who' s yellow, I' il tell you.
Joe Massara, your pal.
- That' s why he didn' t show tonight.
- He' il be here.
Just because...
I know all about that stuff.
I' m gonna give him 10 minutes more.
Then we' il see.
Now, listen, Sam, Joe' s all right.
He' s the best front man in the world.
Why, he can go to a swell hotel and order a suite, a suite, and it' s all right.
Without Joe, we can' t pull the job, and you know it.
What' s that paper?
It' s this layout I' ve been figuring out with Scabby.
- What, this nightclub job?
- Yeah.
Well, let me see it.
And until I say different...... nobody' s gonna plan for this mob but me.
You get me?
He' il learn.
Now, come here, you guys.
Now, get this.
Hello, Joe.
Hello, Rico.
Come here.
I told you to be here at 8: 30.
I was busy.
I was rehearsing, and...
- Oh, you know how it is.
- Yeah, I know how it is.
They' ve been saying it, only I didn' t believe them.
They' re crazy when they call you yellow.
Tell them they can go to...
Say, what' s the big idea of the rush anyway?
It' s a little job we need you for.
A little job at the Bronze Peacock.
What do you mean?
Are you trying to kid me or something?
How can I take the chance?
They' re all my friends, they all know me.
That' s why, they' il never suspect you.
Now, don' t stall, Joe.
I ain' t stalling.
You gotta get me out of this, Rico.
You gotta.
I don' t want to...
Well, don' t you see, I' m working steady now, and...
Can' t a guy ever say he' s through?
You' re gonna be in on this, and you' il like it.
The time is to be sharp midnight on New Year' s Eve.
I won' t.
I can' t.
L...
- I' il be working New Year' s Eve.
- Now, listen, Joe.
This is the joint where you' re working.
And don' t you be forgetting it, either.
Come on in.
Well, maybe it ain' t so hot.
- Maybe we can' t buck Little Arnie.
- I can.
You' re too good, that' s what.
Hello, Joe.
You were in a big hurry about getting here, weren' t you?
Maybe this kind of work ain' t to your liking.
He' s in with us.
Yeah, I' m in with you.
Well, let' s see, now.
Here' s the way I dope this thing out.
I, Sam Vettori, not you, Rico, or nobody else.
- That' s plain, ain' t it?
- Sure.
Only, who stands here?
You kind of forgot that, didn' t you?
Right here.
Smart guy, Rico.
He' s got plenty of brains.
I tell you, I' m afraid, Otero.
I' m afraid.
You' re crazy.
Rico' s coming with us.
Come on now, buck up.
And you, Joe.
You' il be in the lobby and give us the high sign...... if everything' s on the up and up.
You get me?
Yeah, and if we get in a jam, you' il have to take a chance with the rest of us.
Hey, quiet, quiet.
The crime commission buzzard.
Hey, De Voss.
Come here.
What is it, Arnie?
What is it?
Bring McClure over here, I want to buy him a lemonade.
- Not tonight, some other time.
Do as you' re told.
Go on, De Voss, bring him here.
As you wish.
What can I order for you?
- Good evening, Mr. McClure.
- Good evening, De Voss.
- Quite a party.
- Thank you.
Delighted to have you with us, folks.
Mr. McClure, a Mr. Lorch, a financial backer of mine...... would like to meet you.
- May I bring him over to your table?
Lorch?
- You mean the man they call Little Arnie?
- Yes, but...
You say he' s a financial backer of yours?
- Yes, but...
- I didn' t understand that a man...... of his type was connected with this place.
I' m sorry, De Voss, but you might inform Mr. Lorch that we' re leaving.
I came to this place under a misapprehension.
- Now, Mr. McClure...
- I' m sorry, folks...... but we' il have to go somewhere else.
You like my hair this way, Joey?
Sure.
I used to wear it...
Where are you going?
- Just to get a package of cigarettes.
- Hurry back, darling, it' s almost 12: 00...... and I wanna be with you for New Year' s.
I' il be back in a minute.
- What can I get you?
- A Victor Noble.
Stay where you are.
Oh, help!
Oh, God!
Open her up, Tony, this ain' t no picnic.
What' s the matter, Tony, losing your nerve?
Come on, let' s go.
Let' s go, we gotta get out of here.
Come on.
Happy New Year.
Why, Joe...
Joey.
What is it?
What' s the matter?
Nothing.
It' s all right.
- The joint' s been held up, that' s all.
- Held up?
They...
- They shot McClure.
- Joe.
- Now you know.
- It was you.
- No.
No, it' s a lie!
- You shot McClure.
No, I didn' t, I swear.
It was...
I don' t know who.
But it' s our hips for this job, all right.
Maybe everything will be all right, Joey.
Maybe he wasn' t hurt badly.
But you' re through with that bunch.
You don' t belong, Joe.
You' re not that kind.
You' il never go near them again.
Olga...... you can' t go back...... on a gang.
Well, everything come off all right?
Tell me.
Everything was all right.
Only I had to take care of a guy.
- Who was it?
- McClure.
McClure.
You shot McClure.
A million guys in this town, and you had to pick the crime commissioner.
What did I tell you, Rico?
Didn' t I say no gunplay?
Think I' m going to let a guy pull a gat on me?
Any more of these cracks, and this is my last job.
The head of the crime commission.
The Big Boy can' t do us no good this trip.
They' il get us dead sure now.
- What am I gonna do?
- Why don' t you go and give yourself up?
You' re slipping, Sam.
And Tony, what about him?
Where is he?
Getting rid of the car.
He' s like a big baby.
What a fine pickle we' re in.
You and that rod of yours.
Flaherty' s downstairs, a couple of dicks with him.
They' re coming right up.
Stay where you are, all of you.
They won' t know nothing unless they picked Tony up.
Give them the shaft.
I' il be in here listening.
Happy New Year, boys.
Say, there' s a lonesome touring car down the street.
I was wondering if you happened to know anything about it.
How should I know anything about it?
- Ain' t it got license plates on it?
- Yes, but they' re phony.
It was stolen on the north side tonight.
Oh, I got a good cafe business.
I don' t know nothing about automobiles what' s been stolen.
Well, you might if some of the bright young men around here...... had anything to do with it, wouldn' t you?
- Wasn' t there anybody in it?
- Yes, one guy.
He beat it.
But we got a good description of him, though.
I' m telling you, I don' t know nothing about it.
Well, come on, fellas.
As long as Vettori doesn' t know anything about it.
Oh, say, have you heard the news, Vettori?
No, what?
Someone knocked off Alvin McClure over at the Bronze Peacock.
McClure?
No, that' s terrible.
Some guys are sure careless with the lead, all right.
What a tough break for Arnie.
It' s gonna be a tough break for a lot of birds.
Well, so long.
Oh, I forgot to wish you fellas a merry Christmas.
Tony, I can' t figure him.
The kid' s a great driver.
- Oh, he must' ve lost his nerve.
- I' il take care of him.
- Let' s see the color of that money.
- Just a minute, Sam.
I got my own ideas of a split.
And you can take it or leave it.
- We ain' t begging you.
- Yeah, well I bossed this job...... and I' m gonna get my split.
How' d you boss this job?
By sitting here cheating at solitaire?
Well, that don' t go no more, not with me.
- I' ve taken orders from you too long.
- You' il keep on taking orders too...... or you' il get out of here so fast...
- Maybe it won' t be me that gets out.
No?
Well, maybe the boys have got something to say about that.
What about it?
So, that' s it, huh?
Yeah, that' s it, all right.
You can dish it out, but you' re getting so you can' t take it no more.
You' re through.
Well?
Well, the split' s okay with me, Rico.
How about you boys?
No hard feelings, Sam?
We gotta stick together.
There' s a rope around my neck right now, and they only hang you once.
If anybody turns yellow and squeals...... my gun' s gonna speak its peace.
What' s the matter, Antonio?
Why you don' t sleep?
- Yeah.
- Oh, what...
- No, can' t a guy get up when he wants...... without answering a lot of questions?
You stay out late nights, you drink lot of wine.
- Leave me alone.
- Oh, listen, Antonio, I...
I have some spaghetti for you on the stove.
Yes?
It do you good.
You used to be a good boy, Antonio.
In the choir with Father McNeil?
You in white.
Remember?
Father McNeil.
The church was beautiful.
You little boy with long hair.
Flowers.
Remember, Antonio?
Don' t leave me, Ma, do you hear?
You don' t have to go now, do you?
Can' t you stay a little while with me?
Please, don' t go away.
- Please.
Oh, my baby.
I no go, I stay.
Antonio.
Oh, my boy.
I' il be all right, Ma.
- You' d better run along, do you hear?
- Yes.
You run along.
Take good care of yourself, will you?
And give my love to Miss Manccia, will you?
Father McNeil.
Hey, Tony.
Where you been?
I' m looking all over for you.
Rico wants you to come and get your split.
What' s the matter, Tony?
Don' t you want a split?
Are you crazy?
And I don' t want no split.
Listen, Tony.
Rico knows you lose your nerve.
Now, he wants you to be a man.
You better not turn yellow.
Get away from me, Otero.
Leave me alone!
I' m trying to tell you for your own good.
Come with me and get your split.
Hey, Tony!
Tony, where you going?
I' m going to see Father McNeil.
Rico!
He' s crazy!
Crazy!
I tell him to be a man, but he shakes his head and goes to the priest.
Well, I guess that' s that.
We ain' t got any time to lose.
Come on, Sam, get a car, and let' s go.
Take...
Take Scabby.
I' m not.
- Sure!
All right, let' s go.
We' il use the black roadster.
There he is.
Tony!
Did you see all them wreaths?
That hearse is sure decked out pretty.
Well, this was no time to be tight with money.
Tony deserved a swell send- off.
- Poor kid.
- Yeah, but Rico' s wreath beat them all.
And all it had on it was "Tony."
- Not even Rico' s name.
- Yeah.
Rico' s no braggart.
Tony looked like he was asleep.
Didn' t look a bit changed.
Beats me how they do it.
Got a match?
Look, Rico.
There' s Flaherty, the bull.
Things must be getting pretty hot.
What' s he want?
He' s just stalling.
They ain' t got a thing on me.
Gee, we' re moving slow.
We got plenty of time.
The banquet won' t start until 8.
Yeah.
Too bad Tony won' t be there.
Yeah, that' s the goods, all right.
That' s the fanciest I' ve ever seen, Sam.
Look at those little turtledoves down here.
Friendship and loyalty, huh?
- Well, how do you like that, Sam?
- Pretty good, Rico.
Otero told me I don' t look good in a derby.
What do you think?
- Looks just like you.
- I thought so.
I guess I' il stick to them from now on.
"Compliments to a true pal.
Mr. C. Bandello from a true pal...... Mr. Sam Vettori. "Well, that' s nice.
I appreciate, Sam.
That' s swell of you.
What' s the matter with you birds?
Don' t you know how to act at a banquet?
What do you think you are, a lot of gashouse yaps?
Well, cut the chatter.
Scabby' s gonna make a speech.
Well, folks...... you all know what we' re here for...... so what' s the good of me telling you all about it?
Rico here is a great guy!
Well...
Say, Rico...... I don' t know how to talk fancy, but...
This here watch is for you, see?
- From the boys!
Clap, like.
Speech!
Oh, no, no, no.
- Speech!
All right.
You birds want me to make a speech?
Here it goes.
I want to thank you, fellas, for this here banquet.
It sure is swell.
The liquor is good, so they tell me.
But I don' t drink it, myself.
And the food don' t leave nothing to be desired.
Well, I guess we' re all having a swell time...... and it sure is good to see all you gents with your molls here.
Yeah.
Well, I...
I guess that' s about all.
And I wish you birds wouldn' t get drunk and raise Cain...... because that' s the way a lot of birds get bumped off.
Lay off that stuff.
I know what I' m...
A couple of newspaper guys wanna take a picture.
What do you say, boss?
Well, what do you think of that, huh?
Send them in.
Tell them to make it snappy.
- I' il see you later.
- Oh, don' t go away.
- We' re going to have our pictures taken.
- I haven' t had my picture taken...... in the last 15 years.
15 years, he hasn' t...
Come on, boys, make it snappy.
Quiet, everybody!
We' re gonna get mugged!
There you are.
Now, hold it.
Hold it, still!
Look at the guys over there.
That flashlight.
- They might pick you up on that.
- Well, what do I care?
Don' t I want folks to see what the boys think of me?
Hey, Rico, what become of that pal of yours, that dancer guy, Joe Massara?
He didn' t come.
He ain' t been around in a long time.
He didn' t quit on you, did he, Rico?
Bad business to quit on me, Sam.
One guy tried that on me once.
Now, you mind your own business and let me tend to my own.
What does that bull want in here?
- I' il show him where he gets off.
- Careful, Rico.
Who invited you here?
You' re getting up in the world, aren' t you, Rico?
The downstairs is open to anybody, even cops.
But the upstairs is private.
Thanks, but I like to keep my eye on you, Rico.
You see, I' m your friend.
I like to see a young fellow getting up in the world...... that' s all.
So long.
Hurry back.
I will.
Oh, say...
Somebody threw a brick through Meyer Blum' s window last night.
Do you happen to know anything about a diamond- and- platinum watch...... that was stolen, do you?
If you hear anything about it, let me know, won' t you?
Banquet, eh?
Rico got far...... too far.
So now, he' s got to stop.
I' m saying he' s got to stop!
Oh, Arnie, are you fellas going to start another scrap?
What' s the use of my paying heavy dues for protection if there' s no peace?
Don' t worry.
There' il be peace soon enough.
I' m saying he' s got to stop, so he' s gonna stop.
He' s been cutting in on my territory...... and that' s all wet with me.
Look.
I' m sitting here, see?
I' m sitting here quiet...... smoking a cigarette, see?
But a couple of my boys ain' t sitting here.
They' re out looking for Rico, and they got their gats with them too.
Catch on?
And when they find him, it won' t be no banquet that Rico gets.
It will be a wake!
Arnie, you know best.
I' ve never met Rico.
Phelps, 2284.
This is Joe Massara.
This is hot.
Tell Rico to look out.
Little Arnie' s gang is out to put one in him.
What' s the matter?
- Where is Rico?
He ain' t showed up yet.
Come on, quick!
We got to find him!
I want 10 of these.
Gee, you taking all these papers, Mr. Rico?
Why, sure.
Ain' t I got my picture in them?
Here.
- Thanks!
Come again!
- That' s all right.
Fine shots you are!
Oh, no!
So somebody finally put one in you.
Yeah, but they just grazed me.
The old man will be glad to hear it.
He takes such an interest in you.
Tell him the cops couldn' t get me no other way, so they hired gunmen.
If I wasn' t on the force, I' d have done the job cheap.
Did you ever think how you' d look with a lily in your hand?
No, I never did.
I' ve been in this game many years, and I put the cuffs on a lot of mugs.
Someday, you and I are gonna take a ride, Rico...... and when we do, I' il have the cuffs on you too.
No buzzard like you will ever put any cuffs on Rico.
Come on, boys.
I' m gonna get that swell- headed mug if it' s the last thing I ever do.
Boss, I' m sorry.
I should have been with you.
They thought they hit the target, boss, but bullets just bounce off of you.
It was Little Arnie, Rico.
Joe Massara got the tip, and he called up.
We couldn' t find you in time.
Joe, huh?
Well.
I didn' t think he cared enough.
Well, that was white of him, all right.
I ought to give him a chance on my next job.
Guess I didn' t study medicine for nothing, did I?
Thanks, Scabby.
I' m going to see Little Arnie tonight.
If he' s looking for trouble, why, that' s what we got the most of.
I want Killer Peppi, Otero, Kid Bean and Bat to go with me.
Listen, handsome, open up, or you' il tell nobody nothing no more.
Tell him we' re all right, and don' t act nervous.
These fellas are all right.
Come on, stick them up.
Lock that door.
Where' s Arnie?
In the office?
Bat, stay outside that door and don' t let anybody in.
Kid, you keep them covered.
Peppi and Otero, follow me.
Come on, you.
Give him the knock.
Put them up!
Come on!
Hello, Arnie.
- How' s business?
- What' s the game?
I don' t know what this is all about, but it' s a private row.
- You guys better beat it.
- Ain' t nobody gonna leave this room.
You guys are invited to this private party.
Suppose we don' t want to stay?
I wouldn' t stop you for the world.
Only these boys of mine have itching fingers.
Sit down, gents.
Arnie...... you ought to have better sense than to hire a couple of outside yaps...... especially bad shots.
What is it?
Let' s have it!
Arnie...... you' re through.
You hire these mugs, they miss.
Now you' re through.
If you ain' t out of town by tomorrow morning...... you won' t ever leave it except in a pine box.
I' m taking over this territory.
From now on, it' s mine.
You' re growing, Rico.
So this is what you' ve been after all the time?
I seen it in your eyes the first time I met you.
You' re no good, Rico.
If you think you can muscle in like you did on Sam Vettori, you' re off your nut!
I suppose you forgot all about Pete Montana, huh?
How' s Diamond Pete going to stop me?
He may be your boss, but he ain' t mine.
Sam didn' t feel that way about him.
- Sam knew who gave orders.
Diamond Pete could scare him, but I ain' t no Sam.
Sam is through.
Now you' re through too.
Nice stickpin you got there, Arnie.
Nothing phony about my jewelry.
Arnie...... you better quit this racket.
You can dish it out, but you got so that you can' t take it no more.
You' d better take your hats and beat it.
The first thing you know, you' il be arrested for firing a rod in the city limits.
Well...... I guess that' s about all.
Pleasant trip, gents.
Come on, boys.
Oh, thanks, boys, for the artillery.
What do you think of it?
- You' re in the wrong job.
It' s perfect.
Little Caesar.
Everybody' il laugh at Scabby' s story.
You gave Arnie an awful walloping.
Rico...
Now you' re famous.
You see, Otero.
There ain' t no use in being scared of any of these big guys.
The bigger they come, the harder they fall.
Yeah.
I ain' t doing so bad in this business so far.
Well, now.
You look great, boss.
Yeah, but it feels terrible.
You' re getting up in the world, Rico.
None of us ever been invited up to eat at the Big Boy' s dump.
And nobody ever crashed the gate except Pete Montana.
See what I mean?
Now, you don' t want the Big Boy to think you ain' t got no class.
They rig you up better than this in the stir.
If you think I' m going out in this, you' re crazy!
- Go on.
Take a peek at yourself.
- Oh, I don' t know.
All I need is a napkin over my arm.
Now, don' t you look fine?
Yeah.
I guess maybe I don' t look so bad after all.
Oh, hello.
- Hello, Big Boy.
- Hello, Rico.
Thanks.
Thanks very much.
Well, you' re rather lit up tonight, aren' t you?
I thought I better put on a monkey suit.
That' s right.
Yeah.
Well...
Some joint you got here.
It' il do.
I bet all this trick furniture set you back plenty, huh?
Well, they don' t exactly give it away with cigar coupons.
Well, I' il tell the world.
Boy, it sure look...
Oh, look at that.
- Do you like it?
- Oh, I think it' s elegant.
That cost me $15, 000.
Fifteen thou...
Boy, them gold frames sure cost plenty of dough.
Well, will you have a cocktail or a dash of brandy?
Oh, no, thanks.
No?
- Oh, yeah.
Thanks.
Thanks very much.
- Sit down, Rico.
Thanks.
Now, listen, Rico.
I' m gonna talk to you, but you' re not gonna hear a word I say, see?
This is inside dope, and if it gets out, it' il be just too bad for somebody.
You know me.
All right.
Get this.
Pete Montana' s through.
Yeah?
Well.
- He' s through.
Suppose I were to tell you that from now on...... you were Pete Montana.
That you were to take over his territory in addition to your own.
Would you shake on it?
Would I?
Would I?
All right.
It' s set.
I' m doing a lot for you, Rico, but when I get you planted...... I' il expect plenty of service.
Well, you' il sure get it.
Permit me, then, to drink to the new boss of the North Side.
Thank you.
Otero, what did I tell you, huh?
I knew it was coming.
I knew he had his eyes on me all the time.
And let me tell you something, Otero.
It' s not only Pete Montana that' s through, but the Big Boy himself.
He ain' t what he used to be.
Pretty soon, he won' t be able to take it, and then...... watch me.
Sure, boss.
Pretty soon, you' il be running the whole town.
Otero, you said a mouthful.
There' s a guy by the name of Massara out there.
He wants to see you, sir.
- I' il see him in a minute.
- Yes, sir.
What' s Joe want here?
He hasn' t been near any of us for months.
I sent for him.
I heard somebody in Detroit got to Flaherty and told him to start working...... on a dancer at the Bronze Peacock if he wanted to find out who shot McClure.
Gee, boss, you' re wise to everything before it happens.
Yeah, I don' t miss much.
I' il find out if Flaherty' s been working on Joe after I have a little talk with him.
Gee, Rico, what a palace.
Oh, hello, Joe.
Yeah, it' il do.
But what do you expect?
Ain' t I got 20 grand tied up in it?
- Hello, Otero.
How are you, baby?
- First- rate.
Sit down, Joe.
Sure I' m good enough to sit in such a swell chair?
Cut the comedy.
Sit down.
Screw, Otero.
- I want to talk with Joe private.
See you later, Joe.
- Cigar, Joe?
- No, thanks.
Well, will you have a cocktail or a dash of brandy?
No.
Well, it surprise you to hear from me?
Kind of.
I thought it would be kind of nice to have a little talk together...... like old times.
Especially like this.
- You' re looking good.
- You' re looking good too, Joe.
Living easy, kind of, huh?
- Not that easy.
Dancing' s no cinch.
- Yeah, but you ain' t complaining.
- No.
No, I ain' t complaining.
- That' s good.
Yeah.
Dancing' s all right for a sideline.
But it ain' t my idea of a man' s game.
What' s the difference, Rico?
As long as I ain' t kicking, why should you kick?
Who' s kicking?
Only why should a young guy like you be wasting his time?
And I kind of took pride in you, Joe...... brought you into the gang, pushed you ahead.
But now you' re getting to be a sissy.
We got to go into that again?
Can' t you just forget about me?
I don' t want to forget, Joe.
You' re my pal.
We started off together, didn' t we?
We' ve got to keep going along together.
Who else do I got to give a hang about?
I need you, Joe.
I' ve got the biggest chance of my life.
The Big Boy just handed me the whole North Side...... but it' s too much for one man to handle alone.
- A guy like you, somebody I can trust.
- Can' t be me, Rico.
I' ve quit.
You didn' t quit.
Nobody ever quit me.
You' re still in my gang, you got that?
I don' t care how many fancy skirts you' ve got hanging on to you.
That jane' s made a softy out of you.
- You lay off Olga.
- I ain' t laying off.
I' m after her!
One of us has to lose, and it won' t be me.
There' s ways of stopping that dame.
- You' re crazy.
Leave her out of this!
- She' s through, out of the way.
You wouldn' t dare!
- I wouldn' t?
- I' il show you!
- Rico, listen.
We' re in love with one another.
Don' t that mean nothing?
Nothing.
Love.
Soft stuff!
When she' s got you, you ain' t no good for anything.
We ain' t out of this yet...... and we don' t want no softies spilling things!
I won' t spill anything, if you' re scared of that.
- You think I want my neck stretched?
- Well, you know too much.
I ain' t gonna take any chances.
You' re hanging around with me, see?
No, I' m not.
All right.
You go back to that dame...... and it' s suicide.
Suicide for both of you.
Just stick here.
Hello?
Oh, hello, Big Boy.
No, I don' t want that guy.
I don' t trust him.
I got a kid by the name of Joe Massara who' il help me.
Yeah.
All right, goodbye, Big Boy.
Oh, Joe...
- Joe.
- Olga.
Hurry!
- Joe, what' s the matter?
Didn' t you hear what I said?
Hurry!
- Yes, Joe.
Oh, you' re ill.
- I' m all right.
- Rico.
- What did he do to you?
Oh, didn' t I know it?
He said you and me gotta quit.
He' d kill you unless I stuck with him.
I ran away.
We' ve got to get out of here.
As long as we get away!
No.
- No?
You' re not coming?
That' s not the way.
But, Olga, you don' t know that guy!
Please!
- No.
Sit down, Joe.
- We' ve got to think.
- I don' t want to think or sit down.
- You' re coming.
It would be no use!
Where would we go?
Where would we run to?
There' s no place he wouldn' t find us.
There' s only one thing for us to do.
Flaherty.
You' re crazy.
You think that would save us?
Flaherty?
That' s worse than suicide.
- I won' t do it.
I can' t.
- Well, I can do it.
Rico must go.
I want you.
We' il never have peace till Rico' s gone.
I' m going to do it.
Olga, don' t!
Stay here!
Olga, open this door!
Hurry!
Park, 1000.
Don' t call Flaherty.
Please, open this door, quickly!
Rico will kill us both!
Headquarters, I want Sergeant Flaherty.
Sergeant Flaherty, this is Olga Stassoff.
17 Edsel Drive.
Yes, he wants to talk to you.
Hurry, hurry!
Come on, boys, we' re going to a party.
Who' s giving the party?
- Joe Massara.
- Formal or informal?
I don' t know, but we' il find out when we get there.
You shouldn' t have.
No other right way.
- No, it isn' t.
Not if you turn state' s evidence.
We' il make them promise everything will be okay.
Wait, Olga!
- Joe!
- There he is, the dirty double- crosser.
Give it to him, Rico!
No.
Shoot.
Shoot, Rico.
Get it over with.
Come on, Otero!
Let' s go!
You' re getting soft too.
Come on!
Joe.
- Who was it?
- Otero and Rico.
Through the window!
Go and get him!
Are you ready to talk now, Joe?
Well, I' il talk.
It was Rico' s gang that held up the Bronze Peacock.
It was Rico who shot McClure.
That dirty, low, sneaking...
Well, Joe will tell you.
Ask him.
He knows it was Rico.
Is that right, Joe?
Was it Rico?
- In there.
Here, let me help you.
Park, 1000.
Hello, Dan, this is Flaherty.
Round up that Palermo gang.
I got enough on them to use a mile of rope.
Shoot the cars right out, and above all, get Rico.
We' ve gotta watch our step.
The cops are sure to be cruising around.
- You should have plugged Joe.
- And the dame.
If they ain' t squealed about McClure yet, they' il do it now.
- Yeah.
This is what I get for liking a guy too much.
Come on.
Halt!
Halt!
Go on, Rico.
I' m done for.
Go on, Rico.
Sam!
Sam!
They nabbed him over the McClure business, and he squawked.
Now they' re after him.
They got Otero.
- Otero?
- Sam, don' t you get me?
- What are you sitting there for?
- What else can I do?
I can' t run now.
They' d get me anyhow.
You' re out of your head.
Let' s beat it!
It' s no use.
Don' t move!
Hand over your guns.
All right.
Take them down to the car.
You' d better give up, Sam.
Drop that gun before we start shooting.
Come on in.
Get on your feet and put your hands up.
Put the cuffs on him.
You ain' t got nothing on me.
Nothing but the bracelets.
And we haven' t got a thing on Rico, either.
He' s next.
- There' s nobody in there.
- No?
If you see Rico, you' d better let us know, quick.
Well...... you got yourself in a nice fix.
- Yeah.
- The cops were just here.
They got Otero.
Ma, I' m gonna stay here a day or two, then I want a car.
Gonna cost you big, because I' m taking big chances.
I got 10 grand planted here.
Help yourself.
When you' re ready to start, I' il give you $150.
You' il give me?
Whose money is this?
Who do you think you' re talking to?
I need plenty.
I can' t get to it.
I' il give you $150.
Take it or leave it.
Why, you dirty, thieving old hag, I' il...
Because I' m the only one knows where the money' s hid.
Kill me, and you won' t get a cent.
I' il give you $150...... if you' il be a good boy.
He was mean, Sam Vettori was.
So now he' s got what was coming to him.
What does it say in the paper?
"Former gang chief faints on scaffold.
After a futile battle in the courts...... Sam Vettori, former gang leader...... today presented a pitiful figure...... as the hangman' s noose was placed around his neck. "
Listen.
"Little Caesar has never been found.
According to the statement of Lieutenant Thomas Flaherty of the homicide squad...... Little Caesar, the once swaggering braggart of the underworld...... wilted in the face of real danger and showed the world his cowardice.
Flaherty stated further that Little Caesar has contradicted his oft- repeated boast...... that he could dish it out and take it too. "
Yeah.
"When a real crisis arose...... Rico couldn' t take it.
Flaherty ended his interview by remarking:
'Meteoric as was Rico' s rise from the gutter...... it was inevitable that he should return there.' "
Well, just the same, he was the real leader of that gang.
Don' t you believe it.
Rico didn' t have the nerve, and he didn' t have the brains.
He was yellow, just like Flaherty said.
Here!
- That' s what Rico...
- Give me that paper!
Hey, watch it!
- What' s the matter with him?
- Must be crazy.
I' il show them where they get off.
Trying to put that kind of stuff about me in the papers, huh?
I' il show them...
I want Park, 1000.
Yeah.
Yeah, I can' t take it no more, huh?
I' il tell that guy where to...
Park, 1000?
- Get me Flaherty, and get him quick.
- Sure.
Just a minute.
Tom.
Oh, Tom.
I may be screwy, but this sounds like Rico.
Yeah?
- Flaherty speaking.
- Yeah, this is Rico speaking!
Rico!
R- l- C- O, Rico!
Little Caesar, that' s who!
Shooting your mouth off in the papers.
So I ran out when it got hot, huh?
I can' t take it no more?
Well, listen, you crummy, flatfooted copper...... I' il show you whether I lost my nerve.
Thanks, Rico, old boy.
The same to you and many of them.
Come on, tell me some more.
The sound of your voice does my heart good.
Trace that call.
Find out where he' s phoning from, quick.
Say, why didn' t you come to Sam' s neck- stretching party, Rico?
It was a big success.
Funny guy, ain' t you, Flaherty?
Well, you ain' t got much longer to laugh.
I' m coming, and I' m gonna put one in your dirty hide...... for every lying crack that you made about me, see?
I' il show you who' s gonna finish up in the gutter.
We' ve missed you, Rico.
The town has been nice and quiet.
I' m putting on weight.
River, 6547.
It' s a flophouse down at 4th and Commercial.
All right, big mouth.
Get your hat and start running, see, because you' re all through.
Call the papers and tell them that, you rotten, dirty, lying copper!
I knew we' d hear from that guy if I kept giving it to him in the papers.
The conceit of that guy!
They' il have to build a special noose to get that swelled head of his through.
Well, wish me luck.
There he is.
That' s Rico, all right.
Pull in there.
You' d better give up, Rico.
You haven' t got a chance.
You' il have to come and get me.
You' d better be a nice boy, Rico, and come out.
You heard me!
If you want me, come and get me!
I' il be with you in a minute.
Give me that chopper.
This is your last chance, Rico.
Are you coming out, or do you want to be carried out?
Well, Rico, it looks like you and I are going to take that little ride together.
No...
No, we ain' t.
I told you a little buzzard like you will never put any cuffs on me.
You should have come out when I told you to, Rico.
Mother of mercy.
Is this the end of Rico?

[Jules]
Yes, you did, Brett!
You tried to fuck him, and Marsellus Wallace don' t liked to be fucked... by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.
- Oh, God, please.
Yes!
- Well, there' s this passage I got memorized.
Ezekiel 25: 17.
"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides... by the inequities of the selfish...
- and the tyranny of evil men.
- [Whimpering Continues]
Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother' s keeper... and the finder of lost children.
And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance... and furious anger... those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers.
And you will know My name is the Lord... when I lay My vengeance upon thee. "
[Screams]
Oh, fuck.
- [Vincent] ls he a friend of yours?
- Oh, goddamn.
Hmm?
Vincent, Marvin.
- Better tell him to shut up.
- Fuck.
Marvin.
I' d knock that shit off if I was you.
- Die, you motherfuckers!
Die!
Why the fuck didn' t you tell us somebody was in the bathroom?
Slip your mind?
Did you forget that someone was in there... with a goddamn hand cannon?
You see the size of that gun he fired at us?
It was bigger than him.
I know.
We was lucky.
No, no, no, no.
That shit wasn' t luck.
- Yeah, maybe.
- This was divine intervention.
You know what divine intervention is?
I think so.
That means that God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets.
That' s right.
God came down from Heaven and stopped these motherfuckin 'bullets.
I think it' s time for us to leave, Jules.
Don' t fuckin 'blow this shit off!
- Chill.
Wrong!
This shit doesn' t "just happen."
Do you want to continue this theological discussion in a car... or in a jailhouse with the cops?
We should be fuckin 'dead, my friend!
What happened here was a miracle, and I want you to fucking acknowledge it!
Let' s go, nigger!
Come on!
Shit.
[Vincent]
You ever seen that show Cops?
I was watching it one time, and there was this cop on, and he was talkin 'about this gunfight he had in the hallway with this guy, right?
He just unloaded on this guy and nothin 'happened.
Okay?
It was just him and this guy.
I mean, you know, it' s, it' s freaky, but it happens.
You wanna play blind man, go walk with the shepherd, but me, my eyes are wide fuckin 'open.
- What the fuck does that mean?
- It means that' s it for me.
Goddamn it.
- Don' t blaspheme.
- I said, don' t do that!
- Don' t worry, I will.
- And I bet you $10, 000 he laughs his ass off.
- I don' t give a damn if he does.
Marvin, what do you make of all this?
Man, I don' t even have an opinion.
- What the fuck' s happenin '?
- Aw, shit, man!
- Aw, man!
- Oh, man, I shot Marvin in the face.
- Why the fuck' d you do that?
I didn' t mean it.
- Man, I seen some crazy- ass shit in my time, but this -- - Chill out, man!
It was an accident.
We probably went over a bump or somethin '.
The car ain' t hit no motherfuckin 'bump.
I didn' t mean to shoot the son of a bitch.
The gun went off.
Look at this fuckin 'mess!
We' re on a city street in broad daylight here!
- I don' t believe it!
- Well, believe it now, motherfucker!
We gotta get this car off the road.
- Just take it to a friendly place, that' s all!
- This is the Valley, Vincent.
Marsellus ain' t got no friendly places in the Valley.
- Well, Jules, this ain' t my fuckin 'town, man!
- Shit!
- What you doing?
- I' m calling my partner in Toluca Lake.
If Jimmie' s ass ain' t home, I don' t know what the fuck we gonna do,
'cause I ain' t got no other partners in 818.
Jimmie, how you doin ', man?
It' s Jules.
Just listen up, man.
We gotta be real fuckin 'delicate with this Jimmie situation.
He' s one remark away from kickin 'our asses out the door.
- If he does, what do we do?
- We ain' t leavin '' til we make a couple calls, but I don' t want it to reach that pitch -- Jimmie' s a friend.
You don' t come into your friend' s house and start tellin 'him what' s what.
Just tell him not to be abusive.
He kinda freaked out back there when he saw Marvin.
Put yourself in his position -- It' s 8: 00 in the morning, he just woke up.
He wasn' t expectin 'this shit.
We gotta remember here who' s doin 'who a favor.
If that favor means I gotta take shit, he can stick that favor straight up his ass.
- Fuck, nigger, what the fuck' d you just do to his towel, man?
- I was dryin 'my hands!
- You' re supposed to wash 'em first!
- You watched me wash 'em.
Maybe if he' d had Lava I coulda done a better job.
I used the same fuckin 'soap you did, and when I finished, the towel didn' t look like no goddamn maxi- pad!
It' s shit like this that' s gonna bring this situation to a head, man!
You know I respect you and all.
Fine.
Ask me nice like that, no problem.
I don' t care.
Mmm!
Goddamn, Jimmie!
This some serious gourmet shit.
Me and Vincent would' ve been satisfied... with some freeze- dried Taster' s Choice.
[Chuckles]
And he springs this serious gourmet shit on us.
- What flavor is this?
- Knock it off, Julie.
- I don' t need you to tell me how fuckin 'good my coffee is.
I' m the one who buys it.
When Bonnie goes shopping, she buys shit.
But you know what' s on my mind right now?
It ain' t the coffee in my kitchen.
It' s the dead nigger in my garage.
- Jimmie, don' t even worry -- - Don' t tell me about anything.
I wanna ask you a question.
When you came pulling in here, did you notice the sign on the front of my house that said, "Dead Nigger Storage"?
- You know I ain' t seen no -- - Did you notice the sign on the front of my house... that said, "Dead Nigger Storage"?
No.
- You know why you didn' t see that sign?
'Cause it ain' t there,' cause storing dead niggers ain' t my fuckin 'business, that' s why!
- We' re not gonna store the motherfucker -- - Don' t you fuckin 'realize... that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead body in her house, I' m gonna get divorced?
No trial separation.
And I don' t wanna get fuckin 'divorced!
Man, you know, fuck, I wanna help you, but I don' t wanna lose my wife doin 'it.
Jimmie, Jimmie, she ain' t gonna leave you.
Don' t fuckin '"Jimmie" me.
Now, look, you know, she comes home from work in about an hour and a half.
The graveyard shift at the hospital.
You gotta make some phone calls?
You gotta call some people?
Well, then, do it, and then get the fuck out of my house before she gets here.
We don' t wanna fuck your shit up.
You' re fucking my shit up right now!
You' re gonna fuck my shit up big time if Bonnie comes home.
Do me that favor, all right?
The phone is in my bedroom.
Well, say she comes home.
What do you think she' il do?
Oh, no fuckin 'shit she' il freak.
That ain' t no kinda answer.
I mean, you know, I don' t.
A lot or a little?
You got to appreciate what an explosive element... this Bonnie situation is.
She comes home from a hard day' s work, finds a bunch of gangsters in her kitchen... doing a bunch of gangster shit, there ain' t no tellin 'what she' s liable to do.
Yeah, I grasp that, Jules.
All I' m doing is contemplating the ifs.
I don' t wanna hear about no motherfuckin 'ifs!
All I want to hear from your ass is, "You ain' t got no problem, Jules.
I' m on the motherfucker.
Chill them niggers out and wait for the cavalry, which should be coming directly. "
You ain' t got no problem, Jules.
I' m on the motherfucker.
Chill them niggers out and wait for the Wolf, who should be coming directly.
You sendin 'the Wolf?
Oh, you feel better, motherfucker?
Shit, yeah, negro!
That' s all you had to say!
She the hysterical type?
- When is she due?
Mm- hmm.
[Man]
Vincent.
It' s thirty minutes away.
I' il be there in ten.
[Doorbell Rings]
Jimmie, right?
- I' m Winston Wolf.
I solve problems.
We got one.
- So I heard.
Uh, yeah.
You must be Jules.
Which would make you...
Let' s get down to brass tacks, gentlemen.
Is that right, Jimmie?
- Your wife Bonnie comes home at 9: 30 in the a. m., correct?
I was led to believe if she comes home and finds us here, she wouldn' t appreciate it much.
- She wouldn' t at that.
- That gives us 40 minutes to get the fuck outta Dodge, which, if you do what I say, when I say it, should be plenty.
Now, you got a corpse in a car, minus a head, in a garage.
[Sighs]
- Uh- huh.
Thought I smelled some coffee back there.
- Would you make me a cup?
- Uh, yeah, sure.
Oh, uh, um, how do you take it?
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.
About the car, is there anything I need to know?
Does it stall?
Does it smoke?
Does it make a lot of noise? ls there gas in it?
- Aside from how it looks, the car' s cool.
- Positive?
Don' t get me on the road and I find out the brake lights don' t work.
- As far as I know, the motherfucker' s tip- top.
Let' s go back to the kitchen.
[Exhales]
- Here you go, Mr. Wolf.
- Thank you, Jimmie.
This looks to be a pretty domesticated house.
- Yeah.
Under the sink.
Go in the back seat, scoop up all those little pieces of brain and skull.
Get it out of there.
It don' t need to be spick- and- span.
You don' t need to eat off it.
Just give it a good once- over.
What you need to take care of are the really messy parts.
The pools of blood that have collected, you gotta soak that shit up.
We need to raid your linen closet.
The thicker the better, the darker the better.
No whites.
Can' t use 'em.
We' il need to camouflage the front seat and back seat and floorboards... with quilts and blankets, so if a cop starts stickin 'his big snout in the car, the subterfuge won' t last, but at a glance the car will appear to be normal.
Jimmie, lead the way.
Boys, get to work.
"Please" would be nice.
- Come again?
- I said, a "please" would be nice.
I' m not here to say please.
And if self- preservation is an instinct you possess, you' d better fuckin 'do it and do it quick.
I' m here to help.
No, Mr. Wolf, it ain' t like that; your help is definitely appreciated.
Mr. Wolf, listen.
I don' t mean disrespect, okay?
I respect you.
I just don' t like people barkin 'orders at me.
If I' m curt with you, it' s because time is a factor.
I think fast, I talk fast, and I need you guys to act fast if you wanna get out of this.
So pretty please, with sugar on top, clean the fuckin 'car.
Don' t be lookin 'at me like that, all right?
I can feel your look.
It' s a 1974 Chevy Nova.
[Sipping]
Nothin 'except for the mess inside.
Mmm, about 20 minutes.
Nobody who' il be missed.
You' re a good man, Joe.
Thanks a bunch.
- How we comin ', Jimmie?
- Pretty good.
- I got it all here, but, uh, - [Sighs]
- Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand something.
- Winston, Jimmie, Winston.
You gotta understand something, uh, Winston.
Uh -- Uh, no, thank you.
Uh, this is our best linen here, and it' s, uh -- it was a wedding present... from my Uncle Conrad and my Aunt Ginny.
- They' re not with us anymore.
I wanna help -- - Let me ask you a question.
Go ahead.
Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, were they millionaires?
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is.
And I' m positive that if Uncle Conrad and Aunt...
- Ginny were here, they would furnish you with a whole bedroom set, which your Uncle Marsellus is more than happy to do.
I like oak myself.
That' s what I have in my bedroom.
How about you, Jimmie?
You an oak man?
Oak' s nice.
Oh, man, I will never forgive your ass for this shit.
This is some fucked- up, repugnant shit.
Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy that once a man admits he is wrong... that he is immediately forgiven for all wrongdoings?
Get the fuck out my face with that shit!
The motherfucker that said that shit never had to pick up itty- bitty pieces of skull...
- on account of your dumb ass.
- I got a threshold, Jules, for the abuse that I will take.
Right now, I' m a fuckin 'race car, and you got me in the red.
I could blow.
- Oh, you ready to blow?
- Yeah.
Well, I' m a mushroom- cloud- layin 'motherfucker, motherfucker.
Every time my fingers touch brain, I' m Superfly T. N. T.
I' m the Guns of the Navarone.
In fact, what the fuck am I doin 'in the back?
You' re the motherfucker should be on brain detail!
We' re fuckin 'switchin'.
I' m washin 'windows, and you' re pickin' up this nigger' s skull!
Fine job, gentlemen.
You may get out of this yet.
I can' t believe this is the same car.
Well, let' s not start suckin 'each other' s dicks quite yet.
Strip.
- All the way?
- [Wolf]
To your bare ass.
Quickly, gentlemen.
We got about 15 minutes... before Jimmie' s better half comes pulling into the driveway.
- You know what you two look like?
What?
Like a couple of guys who just blew off somebody' s head.
Toss' em in Jimmie' s garbage bag.
Jim, the soap.
Okay, gentlemen.
- Goddamn!
The water' s fuckin 'cold!
- Yo!
Yo!
Better you than me, gentlemen.
- Don' t be afraid of the soap.
- [Yelling Continues]
Vincent' s hair.
- Hey, get out of my hair!
- Come on.
Do it, goddamn it!
- Uh, um --
You' re dry enough.
Toss' em their clothes.
[Wolf Laughing]
We couldn' t have planned this better.
You guys look like --
- Dorks.
- [Laughing]
- [Both Laughing]
- Ha- ha- ha.
Come on, gentlemen.
We' re laughing our way right into prison.
We' re going to a place called Monster Joe' s Truck and Tow.
Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel are sympathetic to our dilemma.
The place is North Hollywood, so a few twists and turns aside, we' il be goin 'up Hollywood Way.
Jules, you ride with me.
Vincent, you follow in my Acura.
Now, if we come across the path of any John Q. Laws,
- nobody does a fuckin 'thing' til I do something.
- What did I say?
- Don' t do shit unless.
- Unless you do it first.
Spoken like a true prodigy.
How about you, Lash LaRue?
I' m cool.
Fair enough.
Monster Joe' s gonna be disposing of two bodies.
Outta my way, Rex.
- We cool?
- [Vincent]
- Boys, this is Raquel.
Hi.
So, what' s with the outfits?
- You guys going to a volleyball game or something?
- [Wolf Laughs]
Maybe I could drop you two off.
Where do you live?
- Redondo.
- Inglewood.
It' s -- It' s your future.
I see a -- a cab ride.
Move outta the sticks, fellas.
- Good night, Raquel.
- I' il see you guys around.
Stay outta trouble, you crazy kids.
Mr. Wolf, I just wanna tell you it was a real pleasure watching you work.
Yeah, really.
And thank you very much, Mr. Wolf.
Call me Winston.
Respect.
- [Alarm Deactivates]
- Respect for one' s elders shows character.
- I have character.
- [Chuckles]
- [Tires Screeching]
- I' d go for some breakfast.
- [Phone Dialing]
- Yeah, he' s about as European as fuckin 'English Bob.
- I know that now.
- But was he cool or what?
- Thank you.
Totally fuckin 'cool, in control.
Didn' t even really get pissed when you were fuckin 'with him; I was amazed.
- [Chuckles]
- Want some bacon?
No, man, I don' t eat pork.
- Are you Jewish?
- I ain' t Jewish; I just don' t dig on swine, that' s all.
- Why not?
- Pigs are filthy animals.
I don' t eat filthy animals.
Yeah, but bacon tastes good.
Sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie, but I' d never know...
That' s a filthy animal.
I ain' t eatin 'nothin' ain' t got sense enough to disregard its own feces.
- What about a dog?
Dog eats its own feces.
- I don' t eat dog either.
Yeah, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal?
I wouldn' t go so far as to call a dog filthy, but they' re definitely dirty.
- But a dog' s got personality.
Personality goes a long way.
- Is that true?
- We' d have to be talkin 'about one charming motherfuckin' pig.
[Both Laughing]
Oh, man, that' s good.
You' re startin 'to lighten up.
You' ve been sittin 'there, all serious and shit.
- I just been sittin 'here, thinkin'.
- About what?
- Miracle you witnessed.
- What is a miracle, Vincent?
- Act of God.
- And what' s an act of God?
When, um, God makes the impossible possible.
But this morning...
- I don' t think qualifies.
See, that shit don' t matter.
You' re judging this shit the wrong way.
It could be God stopped the bullets, changed Coke to Pepsi, found my car keys.
You don' t judge shit like this based on merit.
Now, whether or not what we experienced... was an according- to- Hoyle miracle is insignificant.
But what is significant is, I felt the touch of God.
God got involved.
But why?
Well, that' s what' s fuckin 'with me:
- But I can' t go back to sleep.
- You' re serious.
- For life?
Fuck.
What you gonna do then?
Well, that' s what I been sitting here contemplating.
First I' m gonna deliver this case to Marsellus.
Then, basically, I' m just gonna walk the Earth.
- Like Caine in Kung Fu.
Walk from place to place, meet people, get in adventures.
And how long do you intend to walk the Earth?
- 'Til God puts me where He wants me to be.
- What if He don' t do that?
- If it takes forever, then I' il walk forever.
- So you decided to be a bum.
I' il just be Jules, Vincent.
No, Jules, you decided to be a bum, just like all those pieces of shit out there who beg for change, who sleep in garbage bins, eat what I throw away.
It' s called a bum.
You' re gonna be a fuckin 'bum.
Look, my friend, this is just where you and I differ.
Garçon!
Coffee!
Jules, look, what happened this morning, man, I agree it was peculiar.
- But water into wine, l -- - All shapes and sizes, Vincent.
- Don' t fuckin 'talk to me that way, man.
- If my answers frighten you, then you should cease asking scary questions.
I' m gonna take a shit.
Let me ask you something.
When you were sittin 'there eatin' that muffin?
I was sittin 'here eatin' my muffin, drinkin 'my coffee, replayin' the incident in my head, when I had what alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity.
Fuck.
To be continued.
- I love you, Pumpkin.
- I love you, Honey Bunny.
- Everybody be cool!
- [Customers Murmuring]
Any one of you fucking pricks move, and I' il execute every one of you motherfuckers!
- You got that?
You just be quiet over there!
- Waitresses on the floor!
Get on the fuckin '-- Get the fuck down!
You' re in a blind spot.
Take your dames over to that booth, on the count of ten!
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 --
What the fuck are you doing, you fucking yuppie?
Get down!
- Get down!
- Throw those bags!
- [Ranchero]
Get the fuck --
Get down on the fucking floor!
Down!
No problem at all.
- You gonna give me a problem?
- No, sir, I' m not.
- Well, just execute him!
- Get the fuck down!
- [Panting]
- Yes!
Listen, everybody.
Be calm, cooperate, and this' il all be over in a minute!
Get the fuck down!
You just throw 'em in the bag!
Are we clear?
I said, are we fucking clear?
Good!
Now, wallets out!
That' s it.
In the bag.
- In the fucking bag!
What am I waiting for?
ln the fucking bag.
Laura.
In the bag.
- Yeah.
In the fucking bag.
In the bag.
In the bag.
- What' s in the case?
- My boss' s dirty laundry.
- Your boss makes you do his laundry?
- Sounds like a shit job.
- Open it.
- 'Fraid I can' t do that.
- I didn' t hear you.
- Yes, you did.
What' s going on?
- Looks like we got a vigilante in our midst.
- Shoot him in the face!
I hate to shatter your ego, but this ain' t the first time I' ve had a gun pointed at me.
- If you don' t take your hand off that case, it' il be your last.
- Stop causing problems!
You' il get us all killed!
Give 'em what you got and get' em outta here!
Shut the fuck up, fat man!
This ain' t none of your goddamn business!
I got it under control.
If you don' t open that case, I' m gonna unload in your fucking face.
We clear?
Two.
- Three.
- Okay, Ringo.
You win.
It' s yours.
- Open it.
What is it?
Is that what I think it is?
Mm- hmm.
[Giggling]
You let him go!
You let him go!
- Say, "Bitch, be cool!"
- Be cool!
- You' re gonna die so fuckin 'bad!
- Chill that fuckin 'bitch out!
- Let go of him!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!
- Now, promise her it' s gonna be all right!
- Tell her to chill!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!
- Now tell me her name.
- Yolanda.
All right, now, Yolanda, we' re not gonna do anything stupid, are we?
- Don' t you hurt him!
- Nobody' s gonna hurt anybody!
- Come on, Yolanda!
What' s Fonzie like?
- He' s cool.
Correctamundo.
And that' s what we' re gonna be.
We' re gonna be cool.
Now, Ringo, I' m gonna count to three.
And when I count three,
I want you to let go of your gun, put your palms flat on the table and sit your ass down.
And when you do it, you do it cool.
You ready?
- [Panting]
Okay, now you let him go!
I thought you were gonna be cool.
Now, when you yell at me, it makes me nervous.
When I get nervous, I get scared.
When motherfuckers get scared, that' s when motherfuckers accidentally get shot.
Just know, you hurt him, you die.
Well, that seems to be the situation.
But I don' t want that.
And you don' t want that.
And Ringo here definitely doesn' t want that.
So let' s see what we can do.
Now... here' s the situation.
Normally both your asses would be dead as fuckin 'fried chicken, but you happened to pull this shit while I' m in a transitional period, and I don' t wanna kill you; I wanna help you.
But I can' t give you this case, 'cause it don' t belong to me.
Besides, I been through too much shit over this case this morning... to just hand it over to your dumb ass.
- Vincent!
- Be cool!
Yolanda, it' s cool, baby.
- Get back!
It' s cool!
We still just talkin '.
Point the gun at me.
There you go.
- [Yolanda Whimpering]
Tell her it' s still cool.
I -- I gotta go pee.
I wanna go home.
Hang in there, baby.
And Ringo' s proud of you.
It' s almost over.
- I' m proud of you, Honey Bunny.
- I love you.
- I love you too, Honey Bunny.
I want you to go in that bag and find my wallet.
- Which one is it?
- It' s the one that says "Bad Motherfucker."
That' s it.
That' s my bad motherfucker.
[Jules]
Count it.
How much is there?
About 1, 500 dollars.
Okay, put it in your pocket.
It' s yours.
Jules, you give that fuckin 'nimrod 1, 500 dollars, and I' il shoot him on general principle.
Yolanda!
He ain' t gonna do a goddamn, motherfuckin 'thing!
Vince, shut the fuck up!
- Shut up!
- Come on, Yolanda.
Stay with me, baby.
I' m buyin 'something for my money.
- Wanna know what I' m buyin ', Ringo?
Your life.
I' m givin 'you that money so I don' t have to kill your ass.
You read the Bible, Ringo?
Not regularly, no.
Well, there' s this passage I got memorized.
Ezekiel 25: 17.
"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides... by the inequities of the selfish... and the tyranny of evil men.
Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother' s keeper and the finder of lost children.
And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger... those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers.
And you will know I am the Lord... when I lay My vengeance upon you. "
I been sayin 'that shit for years, and if you heard it, that meant your ass.
I never gave much thought to what it meant.
I just thought it was some coldblooded shit to say to a motherfucker... before I popped a cap in his ass.
But I saw some shit this morning made me think twice.
See, now I' m thinkin 'maybe it means... you' re the evil man, and I' m the righteous man, and Mr. 9- millimeter here, he' s the shepherd... protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness.
Or it could mean... you' re the righteous man, and I' m the shepherd, and it' s the world that' s evil and selfish.
Now, I' d like that.
But that shit ain' t the truth.
The truth is, you' re the weak... and I' m the tyranny of evil men.
But I' m tryin ', Ringo.
I' m tryin 'real hard... to be the shepherd.
Go.
- ["Surf Rider"]
- Yeah, that' s probably a good idea.
I miss you.
Testing.
- Hey, Brit.
- Hey.
- How you doing?
- I' m okay.
Don' t worry, sweetie.
It' il be okay.
Your mom will always be with you.
Seniors.
Quiet down.
Seniors!
This party atmosphere quite simply has to stop.
Move.
God, bitch!
No wonder they held her back twice.
Maya, I heard Principal Mosster' s making you work the school paper.
Yeah, that or juvie.
Now, I' m joined today by Detective Morrison and Coroner Haynes.
They' re here to enlighten you on the dangers of excess.
Now, listen up.
Detective.
- I can promise you all one thing.
- That this will be short?
That if you party too hard for the rest of this school year...... we' re the people you' re gonna meet.
I' ve seen it too many times to even count.
A kid gets a hold of some alcohol, maybe some drugs...... and you don' t know when enough is enough.
Call goes out...... and that' s where the coroner, Dr. Haynes, comes in.
That' s where I come in.
And a few days later...... a badly decomposed corpse washes up on the beach.
It becomes my job to identify the body.
- And do you know how I do that?
- Dental records.
- Kiss ass.
- Yeah.
It' s a sad and sorry task, but yes, that' s how it' s done.
And if there' s no dental records?
- That' s fucked up.
It' s not that difficult of a process.
You take the bone marrow and grind it up in these little pieces...... and then you add in some dye elements and some chemicals...... and you put that all in an agarose gel.
- Get it up!
- Then you take your gel and put that....
My apologies, detective.
It' s so hard to keep their attention, especially today.
- Why, what' s today?
- The district volleyball final.
They love their volleyball here at Blue Bay.
Can' t think why.
Blue Bay sucks!
Here' s a new angle on the Brittney Havers story.
Forget that whole preppy, popular- girl bullshit.
Let' s go deeper.
Let' s expose how little Miss Trailer Park...... became the richest bitch at Blue Bay High.
Let' s go!
- Yeah!
Come on!
Almost, Brittney.
You suck!
Get it on!
Close.
Very close.
The suspense is killing me.
Party at your house, Brit.
Blue Bay!
Hey, Brit, what' s up?
I' il be in a world of shit when my stepfather finds out about this.
Oh, my God.
Have fun.
It' s a party.
Look at those guys.
They' re college guys, frat guys.
I' m not really sure.
Come on, have fun.
What' s wrong with you?
Look!
What are you doing?!
Just giving her a little makeover.
I want everybody out of my house, right now!
Out!
Not me.
What' s her fucking problem?
That' s her dead mother' s portrait, you dumb- ass.
I' m sorry, Brit.
They' re just assholes.
I messed up bad this time.
Why don' t you marry a millionaire, just like your dear, dead mother?
What the hell are you doing here?
Thought I' d write a story for the school rag.
"Gator white trash makes good."
- What you think?
- Don' t you dare, you bitch.
So...... tell me what your poor, desperate, alcoholic mother...... ever saw in booty- chasing millionaire Niles Dunlap.
Why don' t you get the fuck out of here?
You may fool your cardboard- cutout friends...... but I still remember where you came from.
You can take the girl out of the trailer park...... but you can' t take the trailer park out of the girl.
Out of my fucking house before I call the police!
Trouble in paradise?
I' m not gonna say it again!
Out of my fucking house before I call the police!
I said, now!
You can stay.
Great party, Mr. Dunlap.
I didn' t --
Well...... that' s trash.
Like mother, like daughter.
Green, baby.
You know what that is?
Cash!
Everything around me!
Do you?
You remember me, right?
Bald head, tall, glasses.
Where' s my money?
What did I tell you?
What did I tell you?
You think you' re a gambler?
A hundred.
Two hundred.
That' s enough.
Look at me.
- Oh, my God!
- l' il blow your fucking head off!
Next time I' m here, your whole family --
What happened?
Nothing.
Who was that guy?
It' s none of your business, okay?
I' m leaving tomorrow, and you pull this party shit?
How am I supposed to trust you now?
I' m sorry, okay?
You can trust me, Dad.
Stepdad.
- You feeling okay?
- Yeah, it' s just....
What' s up?
There was just this guy at the house last night.
- What happened?
- No, nothing like that.
What, then?
Just forget about it.
Tell me about the guy, Brit.
- No.
Come on.
Tell me.
There was a man threatening Niles with a gun.
Seriously?
Jesus.
When I asked Niles about it...... all he did was give me shit about the party.
I' m sorry.
What are you gonna do?
I don' t want to talk about this right now.
Let' s go to practice.
Brit.
Principal' s looking for you.
Call you back.
Brittney.
What is it?
Maybe you' d better sit down.
Last time you asked me to do that, my mother was dead.
There' s been an accident.
No.
No, not again.
Afternoon, detective.
Great.
Any word on what caused the crash, if you don' t mind me asking?
I do mind.
We' re on the same team.
We' re both looking for answers.
No, we' re not.
I' m looking to wrap this up and go home.
- You' re looking to find trouble.
- I' m just trying to do my job.
What' s your job?
Scratch a wound till it bleeds?
What happened here is the guy took on gravity and he lost.
That simple enough for you?
Nothing is ever as simple as it appears.
Hey, look around you, pal.
This is a police investigation.
You don' t belong here.
So pay that girl her check and go back to wherever you came from.
Detective.
What do you got?
- Looks like swamp rats.
- They probably went in after the body.
Excuse me.
You ever hear of a rat running into a burning airplane?
I' m sorry to be bothering you.
- I know this isn' t an easy time for you.
- Something wrong?
We found rats in the fuselage of Niles' airplane.
- They' d chewed through the wiring.
- Are you serious?
Like somebody put them there on purpose.
You know anybody who may have been angry...... or had a grudge against your stepfather?
What about that guy you told me about?
The one that threatened Niles.
Wanna tell me something?
What did I tell you?
You think you' re a gambler?
A hundred.
Two hundred.
That' s enough.
Look at me.
I' m gonna fucking --
I' m gonna have to take that tape.
According to Mr. Dunlap' s will, Miss Havers shall be furnished a stipend...... until she graduates from a college of her choice.
After that, she' il be provided with a small trust.
- How small are we talking? - $25, 000 a year for life. $25, 000 a year?
What about controlling interest in the company?
His 51 percent will revert to the corporate trust...... of which the board will supervise, subject to the provisions of the will.
There must be some kind of mistake.
I' m afraid not, Miss Havers.
What were the provisions?
That the money would go to a blood heir, if Mr. Dunlap had one.
Otherwise, the trust is to donate the money...... to Mr. Dunlap' s favourite country club.
This is bullshit.
What --?
These are your stepfather' s last wishes.
ls there any other money?
Mr. Dunlap took out a $2 million life- insurance policy last year.
But with no heir, I' m afraid that also reverts to the trust.
That' s it?
A lot of people live very well on $25, 000 a year.
ln the Glades, maybe.
We' il have the papers ready for you to sign in front of the judge tomorrow.
- Term National.
- lt' s me.
Well, how' s life in Blue Bay with the rich and shameless?
Same shit, different day.
Listen, Lacey, I need you to do me a favour.
Give me everything you can on Niles Dunlap.
Hire a Pl.
l want the good, the bad, the ugly.
- Where are you going with all this, T.?
- I smell a rat.
What up, boss?
Thought you fulfilled your weekly hours.
Got another angle on the Brittney Havers story.
This shit ain' t gonna sell.
You need to think sensational.
That' s what I' m talking about.
That' s kind of disrespectful to Brittney.
Fuck her if she can' t take a joke.
But with the will, I' m sure she doesn' t need any more bad news.
What about the will?
I heard she lost out on everything except 25 grand a year.
All his money' s going to the country club...... unless they can find a blood relative.
Damn.
That fucker must have been worth a boat load.
Sixty- five mil, according to Forbes.
Honey, you need to get out more.
Perfect.
Let' s see what we got here.
I' m afraid there' s not much we can do for the little fella.
I didn' t think so, doctor.
What I need here is some information.
What kind of information?
Where did this thing come from?
Why was it found in the control panel of a downed airplane?
- lndeed.
This could be worth 2 million.
Okay, I' il run some tests.
- I really appreciate this.
Thanks.
- Sure, buddy.
Yeah, you rat.
Crime figures are down for one reason only.
Hard work and dedication of men and women of this department.
Excuse me.
I' m in the middle of this dog and pony show.
- We got it.
- What?
The guy from the security tape.
Fax came from Miami P. D.
Small- time hood runs backroom gambling joints for the Cuban Mafia.
I' il call you back.
There she is!
Come on.
- What' s going on?
- There' s a wrinkle in Dunlap' s will.
What do you mean?
The clause about a blood relative getting the money.
Come on, make some room.
She doesn' t have a comment.
No, she is lying!
Order!
I will not tolerate another outburst in my courtroom.
I understand that this is hard for you, but you will respect this process.
Now, Miss King, will you please continue.
Like I said, Niles Dunlap was my father.
You lying little bitch!
Order!
Order!
Court' s adjourned.
We' il try again tomorrow, with a little more decorum, perhaps.
- Bridge.
- It' s me.
- You' re working late.
- You got Cragen' s panties in a bunch.
He' s scared you' il lose out on a big payout.
You tell him not to worry.
Bridge will bring this home.
What you got on Dunlap?
Twice divorced.
Brittney' s mother was the last wife.
Committed suicide a year ago.
It was real nasty too.
Took a long car ride off a very short jetty.
She' d found out about his reputation with the ladies.
What kind of reputation?
He' s seen more pussy than an animal shelter.
I love it when you talk dirty.
Had a world- famous wine collection in the cellar of his $1 0 million mansion.
I wouldn' t expect anything less from a corporate tyrant.
- That it?
- I always have more for you, T.
He was also a big- time gambler.
Seedy backrooms in Miami, as well as legit tables in Biloxi and Atlantic City.
He was compulsive.
He learned to fly so he could squeeze in a little more time at the tables.
Even taught stepdaughter Brittney to fly so he could down a cocktail or two.
Very interesting.
I overnighted Dunlap' s medical records.
Thanks, Lacey.
You' re the best. -- where high- school student Maya King came forward...... claiming to be the illegitimate daughter of Niles Dunlap.
The room exploded in chaos when Brittney Havers...... attacked Miss King upon hearing the news.
Bailiffs restrained Miss Havers...... before the judge ordered the court adjourned for the day.
Plot thickens.
- And these are?
- Letters, Your Honour.
- From Mr. Dunlap to my mother.
- Love letters?
No, I wouldn' t call them that.
Tell me about them.
When were they written?
Summer of '84.
My mother worked in the Dunlap mansion.
One of her three jobs.
For the first month, he didn' t even talk to her.
lgnored her like she was a piece of trash.
But then one evening, that all changed.
Suddenly he was all over her like a rash.
A few weeks later, she exploded the myth...... you can' t get pregnant your first time.
The very same day he fired her, he cut her a check...... gave her the name of a doctor he wanted her to see.
Needless to say, she didn' t know what he wanted her to do with the money.
How could he not see the crucifix around her neck?
This is an outrage!
We' re dragging a respected man through the mud...... based on the testimony of a less than reliable witness.
I will not tolerate any more interruptions!
- Miss King.
- I' m sorry.
It' s just --
It still hurts to think about.
Mom put me in foster homes when she needed to save money.
I haven' t spoken to her in a couple of years.
Last I heard, she moved to Puerto Rico.
I went through her personal stuff after she skipped town...... and that' s when I found those letters.
All from Niles.
All threatening her...... if she revealed that he was my father.
Order!
Order!
Miss King.
You' il be required to submit to a DNA test...... which will be matched to the late Mr. Dunlap.
- Really?
- The results will be back in two days.
At which time this court will make a final ruling.
Court dismissed.
There you go.
- Thanks.
- Let' s go.
Now, what do we have here?
Niles Dunlap, exhumation for DNA testing.
That' s a killer.
- Cancer sticks.
- Everybody dies, believe me.
- Terence.
Terence Bridge.
Term National Life lnsurance.
Well, Mr. Dunlap must be an important client of yours, huh?
He was.
I wrote the policy myself.
Now I' m on the hook for 2 million.
It' s gotta be a pain in the ass for you, this whole mess.
It' s no big deal.
Let me know?
- You' il be the first to know.
- Great.
Now, if you' il excuse me, I gotta open this up.
I appreciate your help.
See you when I see you.
Yeah.
You sure you don' t want some company tonight?
I just need some time to think.
Bye.
You want to dance with me, baby?
- You want to dance?
- What do you want?
- What I' m owed, mija.
- I don' t owe you anything.
Seven fucking million dollars.
That debt don' t die with him!
Look at me.
Three days, I' il be back, mija.
And you don' t want to fuck with me, muchacha.
Cicatriz.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth?
I do.
Dr. Haynes, have you completed the DNA tests?
- Yes, Your Honour.
- Let me see them.
And are you satisfied with these results?
- Yes, Your Honour.
- Very well.
The transcription reads as follows:
"The DNA taken from the person of Maya King...... and checked against that of Niles Dunlap...... is a genetic match.
It is the opinion of the coroner' s office...... that Niles Dunlap is indeed the blood father of Maya King. "
As per the will, Mr. Dunlap' s 51 percent controlling interest...... in the Dunlap Corporation goes to Miss Maya King.
Court adjourned.
Miss Havers was led away in tears after the ruling.
Miss King stands to inherit the shares of the Dunlap Corporation...... valued at approximately $70 million.
ln a related story, a Cuban national was detained here...... on suspicion of murder in the crash of Niles Dunlap.
Thank you, Linda.
Mr. Cicatriz was taken into custody today...... at his home in Valley View.
No word yet on what specific charges....
They got him.
Christ, Mr. Bridge, don' t you ever sleep?
I did, once.
It' s overrated.
Well, come in if you' re coming in.
What did you find out about our rodent friend?
A few bits and pieces.
I' il tell you one thing.
- That was no ordinary swamp rat.
- What do you mean?
Wasn' t quite sure myself, so I ran some tests.
I love rats.
They' re amazing.
They can survive a five- story fall, swim for six hours...... crawl though a hole size of a quarter.
Scavengers.
But not this guy.
He wasn' t settling for scraps of garbage.
He had a taste for the finer things in life.
- Like what?
- Like this.
Cork fragment.
I found it in its stomach with mould residue.
- Mould residue?
- From an expensive bottle of wine.
I' d say at least 20 years old.
Trendy rat.
Yeah.
I think it' s time to celebrate.
Oh, shit.
Why don' t you just kill those fucking things?
That' s a $2000 bottle of wine.
You know I' m good for it.
- We did it.
- We did it, didn' t we?
I saw they arrested the Cuban guy...... and they' re charging him with Niles' murder.
What did I tell you?
That cop just wants all his cases tied up in a pretty little bow.
Nothing' s over until it' s over.
We haven' t even sold the company shares yet.
Nothing' s foolproof, girls.
Quit worrying.
This is the last time we' il be together before the money' s in the bank.
Let' s make the most of it.
Come here.
Now kiss him.
Beautiful, but deadly.
Do I know you?
The name' s Terence Bridge.
I' m handling your stepfather' s insurance claim.
lf you' re talking about Niles' $2 million policy...... you' re talking to the wrong person.
The melaleuca tree.
Beautiful to look at...... but all it does is suck up the water around it until nothing is left.
Everything dies around them.
Really?
That' s fascinating.
You know they found rats in your stepfather' s plane.
Detective Morrison told me.
Now, if you' il excuse me.
Rough night last night, huh?
Few too many drinks?
Must be tough to know when to stop...... when you have the most extensive wine collection.
What' s your point?
Just learned a long time ago...... when something doesn' t add up, you seek out the oddity.
Good luck with that.
Do you happen to have a rodent problem?
Just you.
Who the hell does she think she is?
That' s Brittney' s spot.
Hey, you' re parked in Brittney' s spot.
Haven' t you heard?
She' s out.
I' m in.
So can I join your little Nazi fashion clique now?
You' re trash.
You always have been, and you always will be.
Dyke.
Maya.
What the fuck are you doing here?
lf somebody sees us --
Come here.
- What is it?
- The insurance guy, Bridge...... was asking me about wine collections and rats.
- And rats!
- So?
- He knows.
He fucking knows!
- Don' t be so paranoid.
The insurance creep is on the hook for 2 mil.
He doesn' t care about anything else.
- lf he goes to the police?
- He has nothing.
What if the Cuban guy gets out of prison?
He' il come after me.
- He' il come after me.
- Don' t sweat your pretty little head.
I' il take care of you.
- We' re in the clear.
- Maybe.
I want to fuck you so bad.
ls this a bad time, doctor?
Jesus, you almost gave me a heart attack.
Well, we' re in the right place for that.
What' s on your mind, Mr. Bridge?
Niles Dunlap' s medical record.
The man was 50 years old and more physically fit than a man half his age.
Yeah.
A strong heart, low cholesterol.
ln fact, aside from some bouts with chicken pox...... and scarlet fever as a child, his medical record is unblemished.
That' s good for him.
Doesn' t help him now that he' s toast, but good for him.
Just out of curiosity, what are the long- term effects of scarlet fever?
That depends on the severity of the infection.
lf it was real bad, it could cause a heart murmur...... or sometimes eye or ear damage.
Or sterility.
Sometimes.
Now, what if, and this is just a "what if"...... Niles Dunlap was sterile?
Well, that' s impossible.
- You see, Miss King proved that -- - I know.
I know, I know.
The DNA was a perfect match.
You ran the test yourself.
Right.
But it would throw a real monkey wrench into the works, wouldn' t it?
Wouldn' t it?
lf he was sterile?
Sorry, I don' t wanna waste any more of your time.
-... just call me day or night.
All right?
- Great.
Harvard man, I see.
Yeah. l --
I went to Morehouse.
But I' m just trying to figure out...... how a big- time education at Harvard can land someone like yourself...... at some small- town coroner' s job.
Just seems odd.
See you when I see you.
Yeah.
What are you doing here?
That insurance agent' s crawling up my fucking ass.
Come on!
Get in the fucking house.
Damn it.
lf he could prove anything, he wouldn' t be an insurance agent, would he?
He' s just fucking with you, see if you' il crack.
Crack?
- I don' t think I' il get through this.
- Yes, you will.
Just think about the 7 0 million.
And this.
So how did you do it, Maya?
How did you get the DNA to match?
What the fuck you doing here?
I was just looking for Maya King' s place.
Well, you' re looking at it.
I know.
I was --
Look, man, I' m an insurance...... agent.
Hey, whoa, just take it easy, okay?
I' m just trying to give you my business card.
Here.
Want some light?
All right.
Here.
What do you want with her?
Well, you know, she stands to inherit a large sum of money.
From Bobby Santiago?
I very much fucking doubt that.
Bobby who?
Her father.
Probably.
You never can tell.
Hung around here when he wasn' t doing time.
Died on the business end of a pig sticker in Tallahassee a year back.
Really sorry to hear that.
You wouldn' t happen to know where he would be buried?
County dumped his box in the ground out at Sapienza Hill.
Sapienza Hill.
- Hello?
- Fucking Julian.
Maya, what' s wrong?
He' s losing it.
That insurance investigator' s nosing around...... and Julian can' t take the fucking heat.
He wouldn' t do anything stupid, would he?
Abso- fucking- lutely.
We gotta deal with him.
What do you mean, "deal with him"?
What do you think?
We never planned on cutting him in.
Let' s think about this before we do anything.
Don' t think, Brit.
Just sit there and look pretty, and we' il be together forever.
Papa King.
All right, Miss King, if we can get your signature here.
And...... here.
All right.
All right?
We' re finished here.
That' s it?
Seventy million dollars.
Seventy fucking million dollars!
Sixty- nine million, 427 thousand, to be exact.
Now, you' re sure you don' t wanna transfer this to an account?
No, thank you.
A company check will do just fine.
- Hello?
- lt' s don e.
Seventy million big ones.
I got the check in my hand.
All right, calm down.
We still got shit to do.
We meet Julian at midnight.
You know where.
I' ve been thinking about this --
No, you' re not.
We stick to the plan.
Damn it.
So you have something to hide after all, huh?
Maya?
Maya?
Look, don' t fuck around with me right now, please.
Maya?
Shit!
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Glad you could make it, Brit.
Let' s go.
You' re such a puss.
Remember when we came here with Andy and his brother Ross?
We need to talk.
He does not deserve this.
- The plan' s a mistake.
- No, it' s not.
- Knock it off.
- Did I scare you?
Oh, pumpkin.
- What is wrong with you?
- It' s not gonna bite you.
Let me show you something.
Let me show you...... how to use it.
Come on, put your hand on it.
Hold on to that and open it up.
Good.
Now, I want you to...... gently put them in.
Slowly.
Slide them all the way down.
That' s it.
Slowly.
Then close it up.
And raise it all the way up.
-... is squeeze.
- Can I join in?
Fuck!
- Maya!
- Fuck!
Maya!
Don' t do this!
It' s already done!
Now, go find his junkie ass.
I' m gonna double back.
I don' t want to hurt you.
Please, come out and let me explain.
Come on, Julian.
We just want to talk.
Julian?
Julian, it doesn' t have to end this way.
How did you think it was going to end, huh?
With all of us living together happily?
Moving to Utah, raising chickens?
No.
It' s gonna be me or you.
Bitch.
Hold this.
Hold it!
We' re never gonna get away with this.
Think happy thoughts, Brit.
- Well, where are we gonna take him?
- Where do you think?
No.
No, not there.
They never found your mom, did they?
Her suicide inspires our perfect murder.
At least she didn' t die in vain.
- Where' s Dr. Haynes?
- He called in sick today.
Oh, really?
So, what would it take to see Niles Dunlap' s body?
A miracle.
Mr. Dunlap' s body was released for cremation this afternoon.
On whose authority?
His daughter, Maya King.
Of course.
Of course.
What' s Dr. Haynes' home address?
Brittney, grab a leg.
We gotta get him in the water.
Brittney!
- Shit.
- Come on, let' s go.
- Holy shit!
- Oh, shit.
We are fucked!
- What are we gonna do?
- Calm down, Brittney!
Pull yourself together.
Take care of that thing.
I' il stall him.
Hi.
What in God' s name are you doing out here?
- Don' t you know Gator Alley ain' t safe?
- Yeah.
I was just out here with some friends...... and they kind of ditched me.
So I tried to start my car.
It wouldn' t start.
Just making my way back to town.
Town?
Little lady, town is in the opposite direction.
What the hell was that?
I didn' t hear anything.
All right, missy, you get in the back seat of the car.
Come on, get in the back seat of the car.
Now!
Maybe you could just give me a jump.
Fine.
Shit.
Where are you?
That was so fucking close.
It' s done.
Fucking better be.
Meet me at Julian' s.
Shit.
Dr. Haynes?
Dr. Haynes?
Bridge, Bridge, Bridge.
This had better be good.
How' d you like a murder case wrapped up nice...... handed to you on a plate?
Murder, huh?
- Who?
- Dr. Julian Haynes.
Yeah?
You okay?
You sure?
You were kind of freaking me out last night.
I' m sure.
Fine.
We' re on for tonight.
Make sure you' re ready.
Yeah, I already checked.
Nothing over here.
How long do you want us to stay out here?
- There ain' t nothing down here.
- Pack it up.
We' re out of here.
Motherfucker.
You got any idea what this bullshit cost the department today, huh?
What about Julian' s body?
They killed him.
He' s in there.
The only thing in that swamp is my fucking reputation.
Maybe the gators pinned him under a log.
- I' m sure if -- - Sure what?
That my boss is gonna have my head because of your bullshit?
You' re done.
I' il make sure of it.
Now, get the fuck out of my county.
You eat well last night?
Well, I hope you had a great fucking meal!
Because it cost me my goddamn job!
This fucking sucks!
It sucks.
The melaleuca sucks everything around it.
Fuck.
Come on, come on.
Shit.
Brit!
- Brittney, come on, we gotta go.
- We can' t go.
- Why not?
- I' m why not.
I need some more ice.
I gotta admit...... it was a cool plan.
I' il give you that.
Using those pesky cellar rats to take Niles' plane down...... making it look like a Cuban hit.
Smart.
But not smart enough.
I called some local exterminators...... and I found out all about Miss Havers' well- documented rat problem.
Very sexy.
You didn' t think about the fresh soil you leave behind...... digging up a body that' s been buried for a full year.
Not sexy.
And last, but not least...... there' s the junkie coroner.
Dear old Julian.
Now, that was a tough one.
What the fuck are you talking about?
What am I talking about?
I' m talking about a beautiful tree...... that does nothing but suck up everything around it...... till nothing' s left.
And those roots, well, they take in anything.
Even blood.
What do you want?
I want half the money.
- Fuck you!
- Bad choice.
Detective Morrison, please.
Yes, I' il hold.
Fine!
You' re in, okay?
Half the insurance money.
I think not.
I want half the score.
Thirty- five million.
Or Morrison will have the easiest murder case ever.
Detective Morrison, Terence Bridge.
How you doing?
All right!
Half.
I just wanted to apologize for this afternoon.
See you on the back nine.
No.
I' m not giving up my half.
Brittney!
Fuck.
I' il take care of her.
So how long you been in the insurance business?
Eleven years.
Eleven years, huh?
Must have been tempting.
Cut a deal, skim a little off the top.
- No, never.
- Never?
Really?
Yeah, well, l find that hard to believe.
It' s not your money.
What made you change your mind?
Eleven years of cutting checks to assholes in wheelchairs...... who later are dancing a fucking jig in Maui.
Paying fortunes out to abused wives whose husbands...... inexplicably decide to take baths with toasters, blow dryers.
Eleven years of living out of a suitcase...... watching the rich get richer.
And a boss who' s just been looking for a reason to fire my ass.
So this is payback time.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that' s right.
For all the years I' ve played by the book.
Now it' s time for old Bridge to get what' s coming to him.
It' s so nice to finally meet somebody who can play my game.
Do it.
Please.
You don' t -- You don' t have to do this.
I' m -- I was --
You just --
- Come on, man.
- You want half the money?
Then you earn it.
Okay.
Where the hell have you been?
- Getting her shit together.
- Well, we could take her to Gator Alley.
No way the police is gonna check that place again.
Just act natural.
Nothing' s wrong.
Nothing' s wrong.
We' re cool.
What the hell are you doing?
I dare you.
Fuck!
Fuck!
Double- crossing fucking --
Yes, there' s a beige Buick LeSabre, license plate 2- 8- 8- A- J- H...... driving around downtown Blue Bay with a dead girl in the trunk.
- Did you say a dead girl in the trunk?
- Yes, that' s right.
- Morning, Miss Havers.
- ls it ready?
It took a little while to put it all together, but it' il work.
I need to talk to Detective Morrison.
I didn' t kill her, Brittney Havers did.
We can' t find Brittney Havers.
Maybe you killed her too.
You guys are wasting precious time, man.
You need to be at the bus depots, car rentals, the airports.
- We already checked.
She wasn' t there.
- What do you mean she wasn' t there?
Goddamn it.
She doesn' t need to buy a plane ticket because she already knows how to fly.
We are out of here!
She' s probably halfway to the Cayman lslands by now.
- Laughing all the way to the bank.
- Turn to the left.
Oh, boy, she played me like a punk- ass bitch.
That skank.
Turn to the right.
ls that what it is, Brittney?
You just gonna disappear and leave me hanging with all this shit.
Don' t you see what' s going on, man?
She killed all of them.
You know, she killed all of them!
It' s as simple as that!
Nothing is ever as simple as it appears.
lsn' t that what you said, Bridge?
- It is when it' s the truth.
- Sure it is.
Well, the truth is we found this in the trunk of your car.
Right next to the dead girl.
Looks like it came from the Dunlap' s security system.
What do you want?
l want half the money.
Fuck you.
Bad choice.
All right.
I got a little greedy.
- But I didn' t kill Maya, Brittney did.
- Jesus Christ.
She must have erased the rest of the tape or something.
The FBl raided the Dunlap mansion based on testimony...... of a Cuban national arrested in the suspected murder of Niles Dunlap.
Early reports show that records seized indicate Mr. Dunlap misappropriated...... millions of dollars of his company' s funds...... to finance a gambling addiction.
Turning now to entertainment...... concert pianist Benjamin Koskert continues to wow --
He' s not dead.
- He' s not dead.
- Oh, come on.
Niles Dunlap is not fucking dead.
He knew his corporate balls was gonna be in a sling and he set this thing up.
You killed a little girl, you piece of shit!
They' re gonna love you in general population.
Get him out.
You couldn' t find your dick if they put it in your fucking hand!
ln your fucking hand!
You won' t do this, Morrison!
You can' t do this, man!
Don' t do this, please!
Don' t do this!
Jesus, Brit.
What are you trying to do, kill me?
It' s just a little turbulence.
It' il be smooth sailing from here on out.
It sure will.
I' il tell you, greed, it' il do it to you every time.
Poor old Mr. Bridge.
You had him figured out the moment you laid those pretty eyes on him, huh?
- You ready?
- You betcha.
- You got an airboat waiting for us?
- Yeah, it' s all taken care of.
Don' t worry about a thing.
What' s the matter?
You afraid I did something when I packed your chute?
Maybe.
Take mine.
What are you worried about?
You' re dead already.
You know, you and your mother, you couldn' t be more different.
I don' t think she would have ever had the brains...... or the balls to pull off something like this.
- Well, I learned it all from you.
- Bad influence, huh?
The worst.
Here we go!
I' m sorry!
I' m sorry you had to fuck everything in Blue Bay...... and sorry you kept breaking my mother' s heart!
What are you talking about?
I' m sorry I packed your chute with newspaper!
You wouldn' t do that to your own father!
Stepfather!
You should' ve taken the first one I gave you, you fuck!
Hi, Mom.
Let' s go get our money.
I see your 1 0, 000...... and I raise you 20 more.
Oye, man.
Call.
You gotta be fucking kidding me, cabrón.
What' s that make it?
Three, four million you' re in the hole?
How could I have been so fucking stupid?
I have a plan.
It' il get you out of all your troubles.
But you' re gonna have to trust me.
Do you trust me?
- Really think this will work?
- Yeah.
As long as you can get that junkie doctor to cooperate.
Yeah, I' m on it.
- Dr. Haynes.
- Yeah.
Hi.
- Yeah, sure.
That' s it.
We got him.
Nice to meet you, Pops.
Dickhead.
Come here, Bobby.
You' re gonna need these.
They' re gonna cut down on the glare.
Now, you' re sure you know how to fly this thing, huh?
We' re all set.
The money has been transferred to Zurich.
Well, then, I guess we' il go skiing.
Strong.
They do make them strong here, don' t they?

There are many stories about Michael Sullivan.
Some say there was no good in him at all.
But I once spent six weeks on the road with him...... in the winter of 1931.
This is our story.
Thanks, Mr. Miller.
You go fetch your father.
Pa?
Dinner' s ready.
Thank you.
Bless us, O Lord, for thy gifts we are about to receive...... through the bounty of Jesus Christ, our Lord.
Amen.
Michael?
- Sir?
No, sir.
I don' t wanna go.
- Come on, it' s all right.
I' m scared.
Ice helps preserve the body.
So...... who' s got a hug for a lonely old man?
Don' t help me.
- Peter and Michael.
Annie, Mike, good to see you.
- Did you bring the necessary?
If you' il excuse me, I have urgent business with these young gentlemen.
PETER:
Winner!
I know hustlers when I see them.
- I don' t hustle, old- timer.
Jacket pocket, in my study.
Before I change my mind.
CONNOR:
Hello?
Remind me, which little Sullivan are you?
- Michael, sir.
- Sir?
You don' t have to call me sir.
I' m not your pa.
No, Mr. Rooney.
Call me Connor.
No, call me Uncle Connor.
What do you want?
Mr. Rooney sent me to get his jacket.
I' m busy.
Yes...
Sir.
Hello, hello.
I want to welcome all of you to my home.
It' s good to have so many friends in this house again.
Well, it' s just been me and my boy rattling around in these rooms.
I had this speech prepared, but it would be...... dishonest of me to say that I knew Danny well.
But lose one of us, it hurts us all.
I' il tell you what I do remember, though, and Finn will remember this too...... and that' s Danny on the high school football team.
Down six points, 10 seconds left to play...... four yards to go, Danny tackles his own quarterback.
We all make them.
God knows.
Let' s drink to Danny' s honor.
Let' s swig him to God and hope that he gets to heaven...... at least an hour before the devil finds out he' s dead.
And now, I would like to ask a dear and a trusted friend...... Finn McGovern, to say a few words...... words that I' il wager got more poetry than mine.
Thank you, John.
"My brother Danny wasn' t wise.
Nor was he gentle.
And with a skinful of liquor in him, he was a pain in the ass.
And he never told a lie.
He' d have enjoyed this party.
Me and the family, we wanna say thank you to our generous host.
Where would this town be without Mr. John Rooney? "
I' ve worked for you for many years now, John.
Nearly half my life.
And we' ve never had a disagreement.
I' ve come to realize that you rule this town...... as God rules the earth.
SULLlVAN:
I' m gonna bury my brother.
Then I' m gonna deal with you.
Sure, Finn, sure.
You' il take care of all of us.
Once you get a good night' s sleep.
- Yeah, he' s fine.
Just too much to drink.
I' il talk to him.
- Take Mike with you.
- No, Pa...
Take Mike with you.
Just talk, nothing more.
Why are you always smiling?
'Cause it' s all so fucking hysterical.
Michael.
What?
I had a nightmare.
It was about Mr. Rooney' s house.
It' s just a house.
Go back to sleep.
Is Mr. Rooney rich like the Babe?
Richer.
Are we rich?
No, stupid.
What' s Papa' s job?
He works for Mr. Rooney.
Why?
Well, Papa didn' t have a father...... so Mr. Rooney looked after him.
I know that, but what' s his job?
He goes on missions for Mr. Rooney.
They' re very dangerous.
That' s why he brings his gun.
Sometimes even the president sends him on missions...... 'cause Papa was a war hero and all.
- You' re just making that up.
- I am not.
It' s all so fucking hysterical.
Peter, I can' t come to your concert tonight.
I' m working.
Working at what?
Putting food on your plate, young man.
SULLlVAN:
All right, boys, come on, clear the plates.
You' re a good lad.
- You want a shot?
We' re just talking to him, right?
CONNOR:
Don' t get me wrong, Finn.
I do.
You can' t let a thing like that give you cause to go mouthing off.
You and my dad, you go back many years...... and he is a just man.
So, what do you say?
Make this easy.
We can' t hear you.
CONNOR:
Thank you.
I' m sorry for this misunderstanding.
And I' m sorry your brother was such a fucking liar.
- My brother was not a liar.
CONNOR:
But don' t think I don' t know something' s going on.
Whoa, buddy...
Easy, easy.
We' re just talking.
You tell your father my brother never stole from him.
I' ve checked the books.
It' s all accounted for.
- If he sold it, where' s the money?
- Fuck should I know?
- Did you check his mattress?
- Maybe you should check yours.
There' s something immoral here, don' t you think, Mike?
My beloved father throws your undeserving little brother...... the wake of his life, and this...
- What a hideous world this is.
- You think you' re so smart.
You' re spending so much time in Chicago...
What was that?
We' re out of here.
SULLlVAN:
Jesus Christ, Connor, what the hell are you thinking?!
Jesus.
Michael.
Are you hurt?
You saw everything?
Jesus.
You are not to speak of this to anyone.
You understand?
Not to anyone!
Who' s this?
It' s one of yours?
He must have been hiding in the car.
Well, can he keep a secret?
He' s my son.
Well, that' s good enough for me.
Perfect night for a stroll.
Does Mama know?
Your mother knows I love Mr. Rooney.
When we had nothing...... he gave us a home, a life.
We owe him.
Do you understand?
Do you understand?
Yes.
Well, come on inside, then.
Boys, clear your plates, please.
I' il do it later.
- It' s time for school now...
What' s he doing here?
Michael was hiding in the car...... when I went out last night.
Jesus, Mike.
It won' t happen again.
Mom!
Just the feller...
Our secret, right?
I' m talking about the dice.
A man of honor always pays his debts.
And keeps his word.
I' m gonna be late for school.
Is he okay?
He understands.
Well, you turned out.
You can' t protect them forever.
If it wasn' t this, it' d be something else.
Natural law.
Sons are put on this earth to trouble their fathers.
John' s also made it clear that Finn McGovern' s operation...... will be divided up locally...... among two territories that John will select personally.
I' d like to take this moment to thank Mr. Rance for...... interrupting a busy travel schedule to pay us a visit.
Thank you, Jack.
Mr. Rance met with John and me earlier to make another bid...... for our involvement in the unions.
What men do after work is what made us rich.
KELLY:
Is there any other business?
- Yes.
Connor, is there something you would like to say about last night?
I' d like to apologize for what happened.
Especially to you, Pa.
Two wakes in a month...
What can I say?
We lost a good man last night.
You think it' s funny?
Try again.
I' d like to apologize...
You would like to apologize?
Try again.
Gentlemen...... my apologies.
There have been far too many debts outstanding.
- Mike...
- Just give me their names.
Tell me who to visit.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Come on upstairs.
Mike.
Dad forgot to give you this.
It' s just a reminder for Tony Calvino.
He' s light again.
Are you coming?
No, I' m under house arrest for a while.
Look, I' m sorry about last night.
All right.
Or just looking?
- Here to see Tony Calvino.
Yeah, and who are you?
Mike Sullivan.
Yes, sir.
You gonna frisk me?
- Should I?
- It' s a good idea.
That' s the only one.
I mean, I' m a grown man and this place is getting to me.
Every night there' s trouble.
No one' s got no dough, but all the world' s here wasting it.
Always money for frills and twists, and never money for food.
Sometimes I despair the species, you know?
Number 12 in the beauty parlor.
Who' s the lucky face?
I' m not from here originally, but jobs ain' t hanging off trees, you know.
I' m a boxer by trade.
Nine consecutive titles.
That' s a record in South Orange.
You know, anyone like me, for example?
Is there any chance you might ask him?
- Sure.
- Thank you, Mr. Sullivan.
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it.
Mr. Calvino?
Mr. Calvino, Mike Sullivan' s here.
- Shit.
- He wants to see you.
- Shit.
- Not anymore.
Show him in.
You stick around, okay?
Hey!
How the hell are you?
Yeah.
What brings you here?
Don' t imagine it' s the pussy.
- I have a letter for you from Mr. Rooney.
- Am I behind again?
SULLlVAN:
I don' t know.
Michael.
- Stupid!
The kid would' ve talked.
I' m sorry.
Goddamn you.
Goddamn you!
I curse the fucking day you were born!
I curse it!
Oh, Lord.
God help us.
This house is not our home anymore.
It' s just an empty building.
You stay out of sight.
Don' t go.
- Michael...... when they find out we' re gone, they' re gonna come after us.
I have to protect you now.
Please, Pa.
All right, here, take this.
- Take it.
- I don' t want it.
- Boy, take it!
You got six shots.
If I' m not back in half an hour, go tell Reverend Lynch what' s happened.
Do not go to Father Callaway.
I don' t have any business with you, Mr. Kelly.
But I have business with you, Mike.
Go ahead.
What is that?
25, 000 dollars.
Mr. Rooney wants you to know there' s more if you need it.
You have friends in Ireland, Mike.
Why don' t you take Peter and leave?
I can' t take Peter.
- So where' s Connor?
- He' s in hiding.
- Where?
- You know I can' t tell you that.
You think sticking a gun to my head is gonna make any difference to me?
If I tell you, I' m a dead man anyway.
Think, Mike.
Don' t be stupid.
I' m just the messenger.
Then give Mr. Rooney a message for me.
What is it?
Give me the gun.
Where are we going?
To Chicago.
I' ve done some work for him.
We have to find out where he stands.
Try to get some sleep.
I want you to wait for me here.
- Sure.
You' il be all right?
- Yeah, I' il be all right.
- That' s a good boy.
Hello, Mike.
- Hello, fellas.
We heard what happened.
How you holding up?
I need to talk to Mr. Nitti.
- He' s awful busy.
- I can wait.
Take the man to the top.
Certainly, sir.
Come on in.
We all just heard what happened.
Jesus, I' m sorry, Mike.
Well, thank you for seeing me, Mr. Nitti.
Come on, sit down.
- Like some coffee or...?
- You sure?
- Yes, thank you.
So, what can I do for you, Mike?
I' d like to work for you.
Well, that' s very interesting.
And in return, I' d like you to turn a blind eye to what I have to do.
And what is that?
Kill the man who murdered my family.
Is one more body gonna make a difference?
This is a good proposal, Mr. Nitti.
I will work only for you, and you know I can do a good job.
I do.
We would like nothing more than to have you come work for us.
What you' re asking me is impossible.
Is it?
Let me explain something to you that maybe you haven' t realized.
All these years, you' ve been living under the protection...... of people who care about you.
And those same people are protecting you now, including me.
So if you go ahead with this, if you open that door...... you' re walking through it alone.
And all that loyalty, all that trust, will no longer exist for you.
And Mike, you won' t make it.
And not with a little boy.
You' re protecting him already?
We' re protecting our interests, Mike.
I drove all through the night to see you.
Now I suggest you drive yourself back.
Go home, Mike.
Go home and bury your wife and child.
With our blessing.
It won' t be that simple.
- You heard?
Dad, listen to me.
He' s in the building.
Take him now.
- Connor, get upstairs.
God help me.
God help me.
What do I do?
And you make your choice.
What would you do if Sullivan were just some guy?
God help me.
- And the kid?
Oh, Christ.
No, no.
Think he won' t remember?
I said not the kid.
All right.
I know who to call.
There' s a guy who' s done some work for us in the past.
He' s gifted.
Excuse me, ma' am.
Press.
He was raping my wife.
He raped my wife.
OFFlCER:
Come on, come on, you' re treading on the evidence here.
Two minutes.
You got it, Mr. Maguire.
Harlen Maguire.
Good evening, Mr. Nitti.
Sixteen hundred.
Sixteen hundred dollars is my rate, Mr. Nitti.
And what I make on the photographs is mine.
But I know his work.
He traveling alone?
How old?
What do I do with the kid?
Thank you.
Your mom' s sister?
She' il take you in.
Where is it?
Right by the lake.
We went there once, all of us, when you were 4, maybe 5.
You remember?
The place with the dog.
SULLlVAN:
Sarah.
Oh, thank God.
I want you to know we' re okay.
Where are you?
Of course.
I' il be back there in two days.
How' s Michael?
He' s all right.
How was it?
We' il see you soon.
OPERATOR:
Yes, sir.
I was just cut off, could you reconnect me?
You hungry?
No.
Might not be another diner for a while, so you should eat.
I just wanna read.
- Slow night, huh?
- You kidding?
This is busy.
- What can I get you?
WAlTRESS:
MAGUlRE:
WAlTRESS:
Everything except the food.
Everything except the food?
WAlTRESS:
Give me some honey- dipped fried chicken and a black coffee.
Duck soup.
Don' t mind me, sir.
Used to be, anyhow.
No, thank you, sir.
Is that your profession or your pleasure?
Both, I guess.
To be paid to do what you love...
Ain' t that the dream?
I guess so.
Yourself?
Machine parts.
Machine parts.
- That' s wonderful.
- I assure you, it is not.
- So who do you work for?
- Can you keep a secret?
I' m press.
Which paper?
All over.
I' m something of a rarity.
How' s that?
I shoot the dead.
Dead bodies, that is.
I don' t kill them.
I should hope not.
Always fascinated me, the look of them, you know?
- You ever seen one?
Sorry for you.
Terrible thing.
But it sure makes you feel alive, don' t it?
I' il drink to that.
Stuff makes you sweat, huh?
Yeah, piss too.
Just through here.
Look out, there.
Thanks, Ruby.
Good night.
Forgot to leave a tip.
- Why?
What' s going on?
Get down!
Hey, what do you think you' re...?
Get out of the car.
Get out of the car!
When I say get down, you get down.
Don' t ask questions.
When I say we' re stopping to eat, you stay with me.
You listen to me from now on, or you start taking care of yourself.
I can take care of myself fine!
You never wanted me along anyway.
- You think it' s my fault this happened.
- Stop it.
It was not your fault!
None of this is your fault.
- Just take me to Aunt Sarah' s.
Not now.
- Why?
- He knows that' s where we' re going.
So, what are you gonna do?
You have to listen to me now, okay?
Or else both of us are dead.
I have to make Capone give up Connor.
There' s one thing Chicago loves more than anything...... and that' s their money.
We have to find it and take it.
- Are you gonna help me?
- Yes.
Then I have to teach you something.
MlCHAEL:
Sure I know what the clutch is.
What is the clutch?
It clutches.
Which of those pedals is the clutch?
Gas.
I' il show you.
There' s the clutch, and it does the clutching.
Let' s go again.
Release gas, clutch, shift gear, hit gas...
- No.
I' m doing this.
Hey, 45 miles an hour, that' s a little fast.
Look out for the tractor, Mike.
Watch out for the tractor!
We made it.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, we made it.
No more excuses.
I' ve told you once, now I' m telling you again...
- I' m looking for a Mr. McDougal.
- Just one moment.
Well, this is a pleasant surprise.
I wasn' t expecting another deposit until the end of the month.
I want dirty money only.
Everything you' re holding for Capone that' s off the books.
Open the safe.
You' re insane.
You know they' il find out who you are.
The name' s Sullivan.
You want me to spell it?
Open the box.
They' il kill you.
They' re animals.
Put it in.
That' s for you.
Call it a handling charge.
Tell Chicago I took it.
But if I read about this in the papers, if I read about the savings of farmers...... being wiped out by a heartless bank robber, I won' t be happy.
Good afternoon.
You really trust me not to say anything?
Always trust a bank manager.
There' s no rush.
- Coffee?
SULLlVAN:
So, what brings you guys to the middle of nowhere?
We' re bank robbers.
We' re just passing through.
So when do I get my share of the money?
Well, how much do you want?
Two hundred dollars.
Deal.
- Could I have had more?
- You' il never know.
Come on, come on.
How much did they take?
CONNOR:
Okay, answer me this:
What are we paying you for?
- Where' s my father?
- What' s this?
- Hold on.
I feel like a fucking prisoner.
You are not a prisoner.
You are being protected.
- This is what your father wants.
No, you can' t.
This is the point.
You' re a big baby who doesn' t know his thumb from his dick.
Fuck you.
The only reason you' re still alive is because you' re John Rooney' s son.
My father is an old man.
I am the future.
So don' t you ever talk to me that way again.
Maguire, do what you have to.
Find them.
BANKER:
I' m sorry, Mr. Sullivan, there is no money.
It won' t be Chicago' s.
They took it all out two days ago.
- Who authorized it?
- The accountant.
What' s his name?
This is Mr. Rance in the bridal suite.
Before you proffer your congratulations, there' s no Mrs. Rance with me...... and I' m all the better for it.
Listen carefully...... because I am in no mood.
I' m going to say this only once.
I would like a boiled egg, and I want it runny.
MlCHAEL:
Pa, can we sleep in a motel room tonight instead of the car?
Yeah, that would be nice.
How many more days you gonna want me, mister?
Can' t we close the curtains, even for a little while?
I can' t get no sleep with all that light.
You see anything, you hit that horn twice.
Don' t get out of the car, no matter what.
Bye.
- Ready?
- I' m ready.
Right away, sir.
Runny.
It' s open.
Top marks for speed, no marks for cookery.
What, may I ask, do you call this?
Put it down.
- Mr. Sullivan.
- Mr. Rance.
How did you find me?
And you are so very particular.
Yes, indeed, Mr. Sullivan.
May I ask you to lower your weapon.
Information.
I can' t give you the files.
All right, all right.
They' re in the next room.
- In here.
- Bring it in.
I can' t see.
What will you accomplish by interfering with our business?
- This has nothing to do with business.
You fail to grasp that.
And in business, you must have something to trade.
And you, Mr. Sullivan, have nothing to trade.
Especially not for anyone as valuable as Connor Rooney.
I don' t understand.
Opening bell on Wall Street.
Come on, open it.
Which one is it?
Tried that one already.
Better start over.
You got one more try.
There it is.
Watch the road!
Pa!
Pa, are you okay?
Pa!
Help!
Help us!
Help!
When are you two heading out?
We' ve stayed long enough.
We don' t wanna cause you any trouble.
No trouble so far.
He' s a good worker.
You have any kids?
No.
We met too late.
He dotes on you.
You don' t see it.
Hello.
I had a bad dream.
You wanna talk about it?
Well, come on in.
Take a seat...... if you want.
Math, huh?
Yeah.
I always hated it.
Me too.
So, what do you like?
Did you like in school?
Bible history, maybe.
Why?
I like the stories.
Peter was good at math.
Was he?
Did you like Peter more than me?
No.
No, Michael.
I loved you both the same.
You were different with me.
Was I?
Maybe it was because Peter was just such a sweet boy, you know?
And you...
You were more like me.
And I didn' t want you to be.
I didn' t mean to be...... different.
Okay.
Good night, Pa.
Good night.
Michael, wake up.
Get your things.
We' re leaving.
We left you something.
Hello, John.
You' re a smart man, Michael.
I wanna talk.
Here?
Downstairs.
I didn' t think I' d see you again.
Read this.
Connor' s been stealing from you for years.
He keeps accounts open under the names of dead men.
Men like the McGoverns.
I stood there and helped him kill Finn to line his own pockets.
I thought I was working for you, but I wasn' t.
You think I' d give up my son?
He was betraying you.
I know.
Now, listen to me.
I tried to avoid more bloodshed.
You wouldn' t accept that...... so I did what was necessary.
But I' ve always loved you like a son.
And now I' m telling you, leave before it' s too late.
Think.
Think.
They' re protecting him now, but when you' re gone, they won' t need him.
- This ends with Connor dead regardless.
- That may be...... but you are asking me...... to give you the key to his room so you can walk in...... put a gun to his head and pull the trigger.
- He murdered Annie and Peter.
- There are only murderers in this room.
Michael, open your eyes.
This is the life we chose, the life we lead.
None of us will see heaven.
Michael could.
Then do everything that you can to see that that happens.
Leave.
I' m begging you.
It' s the only way.
And if I go?
Then...... I will mourn...... the son I lost.
What are you gonna do?
Just one last thing, and then it' s done.
Go back to bed, Michael.
I' m glad it' s you.
But then Al wants your assurance that after that, it' s over.
The Lexington Hotel, room 1432.
Is that the house?
That' s it.
I knew there was a dog.
SULLlVAN:
It' s me, Mike.
We' re here.
Smile.
Give me the gun.
Michael.
Michael...... don' t you do this.
Give me the gun, Michael.
Give me the gun.
I couldn' t do it.
I know.
- Pa.
I' m sorry.
I' m sorry.
Pa.
Pa!
I saw then that my father' s only fear...... was that his son would follow the same road.
And that was the last time I ever held a gun.
People always thought I grew up on a farm.
And I guess, in a way, I did.
But I lived a lifetime before that...... in those six weeks on the road...... in the winter of 1931.
When people ask me if Michael Sullivan was a good man...... or if there was just no good in him at all......
I always give the same answer.
"He was my father."
Baltimore, Md 1980
"Think to yourself that every day is your last...
"will come as a welcome surprise.
"you will find me, in a fine state...
"a true hog of Epicurus' herd."
And we find you cribbing lines from Horace, as well.
Well done, John.
I must say, Hannibal... speaking for the rest of the herd...
I' m sorry, for the Symphony Board... that these little soirees of yours... are always the highlight of our year.
- Just so.
- You' re too kind.
I do feel guilty enjoying tonight when a musician is... still listed as a missing person.
MAN:
Shall I confess something wicked?
I can' t help feeling the tiniest bit... relieved.
It sounds awful, I know.
But, let' s face it, so does the man' s playing.
Hannibal, confess.
What is this divine- looking <i>amuse- bouche</ i>?
I' m afraid you won' t even try it.
<i>- Bon appétit. </ i>
Special Agent Graham.
What an unexpected pleasure.
I' m sorry to bother you again, Dr. Lecter.
I know it' s late.
It' s no bother.
We' re both night owls, I think.
- Come in, please.
Let me take your coat.
What' s on your mind?
We' ve been on the wrong track this whole time.
Our whole profile' s wrong.
We' ve been looking for someone with a crazy grudge... and some kind of anatomical knowledge.
Decertified doctors, med school dropouts...
laid- off mortuary workers --
From the precision of the cuts, and his choice of souvenirs.
That' s where we' re off- target.
He' s not collecting body parts.
- Then why keep them?
He' s eating them.
We were at Molly' s parents' for New Year' s... and her dad was showing my son, Josh... how to carve a roasted chicken.
"on either side of the back."
I had never heard that expression before, "oysters."
Then suddenly I had a flash of the third victim...
She was missing flesh from her back.
Every single victim lost some body part used in cooking.
Have you shared this with the Bureau?
But I' m right.
I know I' m right.
I' m starting to be able to think like this one.
Yeah, it' s fascinating.
You know, I' d always suspected as much.
I' m not psychic, Doctor.
No, this is different.
More akin to artistic imagination.
You can assume the emotional point of view of others... even those that might scare or sicken you.
It' s a troubling gift, I should think.
How I' d love to get you on my couch.
Something still doesn' t make sense to me.
You' re the best forensic psychiatrist I know... and somehow, in all our time together... this possibility never occurred to you.
I am only human, Will.
Perhaps I made a mistake.
You don' t strike me as a man who makes very many mistakes.
Now I' m sorry to think I might... no longer enjoy your full confidence.
No, I didn' t say that.
I don' t know what I' m saying.
I' m very, very tired.
I almost had it.
It' il come to you.
Why don' t you come back in the morning?
I' il clear some time on my schedule and... then we can get started in revising our profile.
WlLL:
LECTER:
Rest here, and I' il get your coat.
Won' t be a tick.
Don' t move.
You' re in shock now.
I don' t want you to feel any pain.
Then drowsy.
Don' t resist.
It' s so gentle.
Like slipping into a warm bath.
I regret it came to this, Will.
But every game must have its ending.
Remarkable boy.
I do admire your courage.
I think I' il eat your heart.
[Seagulls crying]
Marathon, Fl Several Years Later
Hey, Dad.
Someone' s here.
Hey.
You' ve got a beautiful set- up here, Will.
Yeah, it' s good.
- You know why I' m here?
- Yeah, I can guess.
How much do you know?
Just what was in the <i>Miami Herald</ i> and the <i>Times</ i>.
Two families killed a month apart in their homes.
Birmingham and Atlanta.
The circumstances were similar.
The same.
What have you kept out of the papers?
He smashes mirrors and uses the pieces.
Wears latex gloves, so we' ve got no prints.
Size 1 1 shoe.
He' s not too comfortable with locks.
Pried open a patio door in Birmingham... used a glass cutter in Atlanta.
And his blood' s AB positive.
- Somebody hurt him?
He' s a secretor.
Tell me something, Will.
You knew what this was.
Did you ever consider picking up the phone and giving me a call?
You' ve got all the people you need.
You got Bloom in Chicago.
I' ve got you down here fixing boat motors?
Yeah, I like fixing boat motors.
I wouldn' t be very useful to you.
I don' t think about it anymore.
Really?
The last two we had, you caught.
By doing what you and the other guys are doing.
That' s not entirely true.
It' s the way you think.
There' s been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.
Projection.
Whatever.
- I know you don' t like it.
- You wouldn' t like it, either.
This freak killed the Jacobis in Birmingham... on Saturday night, February 25.
Full moon.
<i>He killed the Leeds family</ i> <i>in Atlanta... </ i> <i>a few nights ago, March 28. </ i>
<i>One day short of a lunar month. </ i>
lf we' re lucky, we may have a little over three weeks... before he does it again.
Will, do you respect my judgment?
Of course.
I think we have a better chance to catch him fast if you help.
Just look.
Then help me brief the locals.
MOLLY:
<i>Crawford has</ i> <i>the whole damn government. </ i>
<i>Why does he need you? </ i>
He just wants me to look at some evidence, Molly.
Give him another point of view.
It' s a few days, a week maybe, and I' il be right back.
- And you believed that?
These kinds of cases come up very rarely... and I' ve had experience.
Yes, you have.
You' re paid up, Will.
All of us.
Even Josh.
There' s a chance I could help them save some lives.
How do I say no to that?
This one will never see me or know my name.
I' il just help them find him.
The cops will take him down, not me.
I' il be in the back of the pack, Molly, I promise.
Never in your life.
- I know you.
Come here.
I love you.
See you in a few days.
I' il call you tonight.
'Bye, Dad!
Leeds House, Atlanta, Ga
Where' s the dog?
No one heard barking.
There' s nothing about it in the case file.
The intruder enters in the dark and cuts Charles Leeds' throat.
He shoots Valerie Leeds in the stomach as she' s rising... disabling her but not killing her.
He leaves her to watch her husband die... then turns and goes down the hall.
The children were....
The children were still in bed when they were shot... which might indicate that he used a silencer.
He dragged the bodies into the master bedroom, but why?
They were already dead and none of them got the same... extra attention as Mrs. Leeds.
Small pieces of mirror were inserted... in the orbital sockets of the victims.
This occurred post- mortem.
Why did you put mirrors in their eyes?
The pieces of mirror are to make their eyes look alive!
He wanted an audience.
He wanted them all lined up... watching him when he touched her.
When he touched her.
Touched.
Talcum powder.
There was talcum powder.
"A complete search of the home...
You took your gloves off, didn' t you?
You took your gloves off, touched her... with your bare hand and wiped her down.
But when the gloves were off, did you open her eyes?
<i>Are the Leeds' bodies</ i> <i>still at the morgue? </ i>
Who' s good with latent prints here?
CRAWFORD:
They' ve already printed the bodies.
Not the bodies.
Tell them to check the eyes.
Even her corneas.
I think he took his gloves off.
I think he had to touch her.
Jesus, Will.
Gentlemen.
<i>This is what the subject' s teeth</ i> <i>look like. </ i>
<i>The impressions came from</ i> <i>bite marks on Mrs. Leeds. </ i>
This degree of crookedness... plus the groove in this central incisor... makes his bite signature unique.
Fuckin 'shark.
Knock it off!
We' re grateful to have the FBl.
That right, Jack?
Yes, sir.
Anything you want to add, Mr. Graham?
Why don' t you come on up to the front, please?
Mrs. Leeds and Mrs. Jacobi were the primary targets.
The others were killed just to complete his fantasy.
I know that might be hard to accept given what you saw... but this was not random.
He was never out of control.
These attacks were organised, the women carefully chosen.
We don' t know how he' s choosing them, or why.
They lived in different states and never met.
But there is some connection.
There' s some common factor, and that' s the key.
Find out what that is, and we' il save lives.
'Cause this one is gonna go on and on... until we get smart or we get lucky.
He won' t stop.
- Why not?
- Because it makes him God.
Would you give that up?
You asked about the dog.
Last night a vet called us.
Leeds and his oldest boy brought the dog in... the afternoon before they were killed.
Had a puncture wound to its abdomen.
The vet had to put it down.
Was it wearing a collar with the address on it?
No.
- Did the Jacobis have a dog?
- No dog.
They found a litter box in the basement... cat droppings in it, no cat.
lf the cat was attacked, the Jacobis may have buried it.
Ask Birmingham to check that backyard.
And tell them to use a methane probe, it' s faster.
[Telephone rings]
Yeah.
It' s for you.
Crawford.
Carl, you' re the light of my life.
<i>Would it hold up in court? </ i>
Great work. </ i>
They found a print on Mrs. Leeds' eye.
Partial thumb.
Besides that, there' s nothing else to tell you.
COMMlSSlONER:
Will Graham!
Remember me?
Freddy Lounds.
I covered the Lecter case for the <i>Tattler</ i>.
- Did the paperback.
- Yeah, I remember.
When did they bring you in?
You think the Tooth Fairy will be bigger than Lecter?
I mean, he' s already beaten Lecter' s score --
You write lying shit, and the <i>Tattler</ i> is an asswipe!
You stay away from me.
Get away, Lounds.
How about an exclusive?
Sorry about that.
That guy snuck into the hospital and took those pictures of me.
Remember?
With the tubes hanging out of me?
Forget that prick.
Give yourself some credit.
When we catch the Tooth Fairy... that print plus his teeth will burn him.
You did that, Will.
That evidence was there, Jack.
- It was there for anyone to see.
- But nobody else did.
All I' m sayin 'is, that was very good work.
No, good work would be seeing it all the way through... and catching the guy.
And I can' t do that.
I did what you asked me to do.
I' m going home.
I don' t even have any idea who this guy is.
What I just gave them was broad strokes.
He' s got no face to me.
That' s what you said about Garrett Hobbs, remember?
- And you figured him out.
- No, I didn' t.
- You didn' t?
- No, I was stuck on Hobbs.
I had help.
From Lecter.
WlLL:
Jack, don' t play games with me.
Don' t do it.
Just tell me what' s on your mind.
I' m saying maybe we' ve got a resource we should look into.
ls that what this was about?
Did you just want to ask me that all along?
I' m just doing my job.
lf you know a better shortcut, let me know it.
I' il go myself.
lf you can' t handle it, God knows I' d understand that.
<i>As a research subject, Lecter</ i> <i>has proven most disappointing. </ i>
He' s simply impenetrable to psychological testing.
Rorschach, Thematic Apperception.
He folds them into origami.
As you see.
So you can imagine the stir your little visit... is causing among my staff, Mr. Graham.
lf you' d care to share some insights --
Dr. Chilton, I' m sorry, I' ve got a 4: 1 7 flight back to Atlanta.
Of course.
Tell me, when you saw Lecter' s murders... their style, so to speak... were you able, perhaps, to reconstruct his fantasies?
And, if so, did you jot down any impressions?
WlLL:
Let me be frank, Mr. Graham.
The first analysis of Lecter will be a publisher' s wet dream.
I' d give you full credit, of course.
You must have some advice.
You caught him.
What was your trick?
I let him kill me.
That' s the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court.
I keep getting it for Christmas.
LECTER:
Christmas, yes.
Did you get my card?
I got it, thank you.
So nice of the Bureau' s crime lab to forward that.
<i>They wouldn' t give me</ i> <i>your home address. </ i>
Dr. Bloom sent me your article on surgical addiction... in the <i>Journal of Forensic Psychiatry</ i>.
LECTER:
Very interesting, even to a layman.
You say you' re a layman.
But it was you who caught me.
Wasn' t it, Will?
Do you know how you did it?
I got lucky.
I don' t think you believe that.
It' s in the transcript.
What does it matter now?
It doesn' t matter to me, Will.
I need your advice, Dr. Lecter.
Birmingham and Atlanta.
You want to know how he' s choosing them, don' t you?
I want you to tell me them.
Why should l?
There are things you don' t have.
Maybe even computer access.
I' d speak to the Chief of Staff.
Yes, Dr. Chilton.
Gruesome, isn' t he?
He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at panties.
lf you recall, Will... our last collaboration ended rather messily.
- And there' s another reason.
- I' m all ears.
I thought you might enjoy the challenge.
Find out if you' re smarter than the person I' m looking for.
Then, by implication, you think you' re smarter than I am... since it was you who caught me.
I know I' m not smarter than you.
Then how did you catch me?
You had disadvantages.
What disadvantages?
You' re insane.
You' re very tanned, Will.
<i>And your hands are so rough. </ i>
<i>Not like a cop' s hands anymore. </ i>
And that shaving lotion is something a child would select.
Has a little ship on the bottle, does it not?
And how is young Josh and the lovely Molly?
<i>They' re always in my thoughts, </ i> <i>you know. </ i>
You will not persuade me with appeals... to my intellectual vanity.
You' il either do it or you won' t.
LECTER: ls that the case file?
With photos?
Let me keep them, and I might consider it.
No.
Do you dream much, Will?
Goodbye, Dr. Lecter.
You haven' t threatened to take away my books yet!
Give me the file, then!
And I' il tell you what I think.
And privacy.
Just like old times, Will?
This is a very shy boy, Will.
I' d love to meet him.
Have you considered that he is disfigured... or that he may believe he is disfigured?
Yeah, the mirrors.
Notice he smashes all the mirrors... not just enough to get the pieces he wants.
And, of course, those shards in their eyes... so he can see himself there.
That' s interesting.
No, it' s not.
You thought of it before.
I had considered it.
- What about the women?
Mere puppets.
You need to see them living, the way they caught his eye.
That' s impossible.
Not quite.
What were the yards like?
Big backyards, fenced, some hedges.
Why?
Because if this pilgrim... feels a special relationship with the moon... he might like to go outside and look at it.
You ever seen blood in the moonlight?
It appears quite black.
lf one were nude, say, it' d be better to have... outdoor privacy for that sort of thing.
You think the yards are a factor when he selects victims?
Yes.
Victims.
- I take it.
- I might not have time.
I do.
I have oodles.
I need your opinion now.
Then here' s one:
You stink of fear under that cheap lotion.
You stink of fear, Will, but you' re not a coward!
You fear me, but still you came here.
You fear this shy boy, yet still you seek him out.
Don' t you understand, Will?
You caught me because we' re very much alike.
Without our imaginations... we' d be like all those other poor dullards.
Fear is the price of our instrument.
<i>But I can help you bear it. </ i>
- You getting his face?
Okay, you got it?
All right, let' s get the fuck out of here.
<i>Sure you' re okay? </ i>
Yeah, I' m okay.
<i>What do you think he</ i> <i>meant by "see them living"? </ i>
I don' t know, maybe nothing.
It' s hard to separate his bullshit.
But I' m gonna make another pass at the Leeds' house.
Get them, Duchess. </ i>
<i>Go get them, girl! </ i>
<i>Charles!
<i>Hey, gang. </ i>
<i>How is everybody doing? </ i>
SUSlE:
<i>That' s my girl. </ i>
<i>Hi, Dad. </ i>
<i>And sweetie? </ i>
DeMille. </ i>
<i>What do you think? </ i>
<i>Little closer. </ i>
<i>I think we' d better put</ i> <i>these kids to bed early tonight. </ i>
Don' t you think? </ i>
<i>You stop it!
<i>Now I get my kiss? </ i>
<i>- I want one.
Jacobi House, Birmingham, Al
Won' t nobody get in through here again.
I' il guaran- damn- tee it.
Why didn' t he break in down there?
It' s more hidden.
Hell, that door' s got deadbolts.
Reckon he was in too big a hurry.
No, this one doesn' t hurry.
You sat right here, didn' t you?
You watched the children bury the cat.
<i>And then you waited for dark. </ i>
WlLL:
You had to sign your work.
Grandma? </ i>
<i>I' ve never seen a child</ i> <i>as dirty and disgusting as you. </ i>
You' re soaking wet. </ i>
YOUNG DOLARHYDE:
<i>No. </ i>

<i>You' re hurting me! </ i>
<i>Shut up, </ i> <i>you filthy little beast! </ i>
<i>I should have put you in</ i> <i>an orphanage, grandson or not. </ i>
<i>Into the bathroom! </ i>

DOLARHYDE:
<i>Take that filthy thing</ i> <i>in your hand.
<i>Now! </ i>

GRANDMA:
Do you want</ i> <i>me to cut it off?
DOLARHYDE:
<i>I pledge you my word, Francis... </ i> <i>if you ever make</ i> <i>your bed dirty again... </ i>
<i>Do you understand? </ i>
I' il be a good boy.
Good morning, Will.
So nice of you to visit again.
He carved this on a tree near the Jacobi house.
With a Buck knife.
The same one later used on Charles Leeds.
Yes.
Take a walk with me.
He had a second tool, too.
A bolt cutter.
He used that to clear his view.
But?
I don' t think that' s what he brought it for.
Too awkward.
And he had to carry it a long way.
And what do we make of that symbol?
Asian Studies at Langley... identified it as a Chinese character.
It appears on a mah- jong piece.
- It marks the Red Dragon.
Correct.
This boy begins to interest me.
We don' t know what greater meaning the symbol might have --
Do you like my little exercise cage, Will?
<i>My so- called lawyer</ i> <i>is always nagging Dr. Chilton... </ i> <i>for better accommodations. </ i>
I don' t know which is the greater fool.
Perhaps if you could offer some insight into --
"A robin redbreast in a cage Puts all heaven in a rage"
Ever been a redbreast, Will?
Of course you have.
I' m allowed 30 minutes in here, once a week.
Get to the point.
He meant to use the bolt cutter to enter the house... but he didn' t.
lnstead he broke in through the patio doors.
The noise woke Jacobi, and he had to shoot him on the stairs.
That wasn' t planned.
And that' s not like him.
We mustn' t judge too harshly, Will.
It was his first time.
Have you never felt a sudden rush of panic?
Yeah, that' s the fear we talked about.
<i>It takes experience</ i> <i>to master it. </ i>
You sensed who I was... back when I was committing what you call my "crimes."
Yes.
So you were hurt not by a fault in your perception... or your instincts... but because you failed to act on them until it was too late.
- You could say that.
- But you' re wiser now.
lmagine what you would do, Will, if you could go back in time.
Put two in your head before you could palm that stiletto.
Very good, Will.
You know, I believe we' re making progress.
And that' s what our pilgrim is doing.
He is evolving.
The case file mentioned videos of the Leeds family.
- No.
- Why not?
- It would be obscene.
You don' t make it easy, do you?
Still, one aims to please.
I' il call you if I think of anything else.
Would you perhaps like to leave me your home number?
- That' s the end of our session.
It was only his first time.
Already in Atlanta he did much better.
Rest assured, my dear Will... this one will give you plenty of exercise.
My love to Molly and Josh, goodbye.
Go to the back of the cell, Dr. Lecter.
Face the wall.
BARNEY: lf you turn around before the lock snaps... you' il get a dart.
LECTER:
You got ten minutes to talk to your lawyer.
LECTER:
Thanks so much, Barney.
LAWYER:
<i>I have those documents</ i> <i>you requested me -- </ i>

Bloom' s office. </ i>
Hi.
This is Bob Greer at Blaine and Edwards Publishing.
Dr. Bloom asked me to send <i>The Psychiatrist and the Law</ i>... to Will Graham.
His assistant was supposed to give me... the address and phone number, but, darn it, she never did.
<i>I' m just a temp. </ i>
<i>Linda will be in on Monday. </ i>
I have to catch FedEx in about five minutes.
I hate to bother Dr. Bloom about it... because he told Linda to send it... and I don' t want to get her into trouble.
It' s right there in the Rolodex, or whatever.
I' il dance at your wedding if you read it to me.
TEMP:
<i>I' m really not supposed to. </ i>
I won' t take up any more of your time.
Graham, Will.
<i>All right.
<i>It doesn' t give a home address. </ i>
TEMP:
<i>" FBl, 935 Pennsylvania Avenue</ i> <i>Northwest, Washington, D. C. "</ i>
TEMP:
<i>" P. O. Box 3680, </ i> <i>Marathon, Florida. "</ i>
TEMP:
<i>Yes. </ i>
That' s fine.
You' re an angel.
I' m Francis Dolarhyde.
I' ve come for the package of infrared.
Put your back against the door and come... forward three steps till you feel tile under your feet.
And there' s a stool just on the left.
Same Mr. D who' s head of Tech Services, am I right?
I' m Reba McClane.
Just a second more and I will get you some light.
Okay, here we go.
So, what do you need the lR for?
It' s for the zoo.
They want to photograph the nocturnal animals.
That' s great.
I love animals.
I got to warn you, though.
<i>This stuff is pretty sensitive. </ i>
<i>It can be mean to handle. </ i>
But I guess I don' t need to tell you that.
Hey, Reba.
Oh, Mr. D. Whoa!
I' m not interrupting anything, am l?
No, Ralph.
It' s starting to spritz outside.
You ride a motorcycle.
How' s that gonna help me with the rain?
I thought maybe we' d stop off someplace... have ourselves a little sundowner.
- It' s cool.
That' s cool.
No problemo.
lf there' s anything I hate worse than pity, it' s fake pity.
Especially from a walking hard- on like Ralph Mandy.
- Sorry.
- I have no pity.
Ride with me!
Thanks, but I take the bus all the time.
Mandy is a fool.
Ride with me... for my pleasure.
You want to come in?
- Maybe another time.
- I will come in.
When is the zoo project?
- Maybe next week.
They' il call.
- I love zoos.
ln fact one of my earliest memories is seeing a cougar... when I was about five.
<i>I didn' t lose my sight</ i> <i>till I was seven.
Could you hand me that knife?
I' ve always tried to hang on to what that cougar looked like.
It' s more like a donkey or a goat.
Maybe he' s just something I dreamed up.
You okay?
You don' t say much, do you?
No, I guess not.
Let' s talk about something and get it out of the way, okay?
I can hear that you' ve had... some kind of soft palate repair.
But I understand you fine because you speak very well.
lf you don' t want to talk to me, that' s cool.
I know what it' s like to have people... always thinking that you' re different.
That' s good.
May I touch your face?
I want to know if you' re smiling or frowning.
I want to know whether I should just shut up or not.
Take my word that I' m smiling.
I have to go.
lf I offended you, I didn' t mean to.
No.
WlLL:
<i>It' d help if I could see</ i> <i>some of their personal effects. </ i>
Do you have those things?
I mean, other than... one or two little keepsakes Niles Jacobi got.
That would be Mr. Jacobi' s surviving son by his first wife?
Yes.
As their executor, I keep all that stuff in the office... along with some of the smaller valuables, till after probate.
But the Birmingham P. D. 's been all through it.
Could you pack those things and ship them up to me?
I know it' s a pain in the ass.
Hell... probate judge is an old golfing buddy of mine.
Son, just tell me you' re gonna nail that son of a bitch.
We' re doing our best.
Hey, thanks, Mr. Metcalf.
A note hidden in Lecter' s cell.
Might' ve been mailed by the Tooth Fairy.
He wants Lecter' s approval.
He' s curious about you.
He' s asking questions.
I' ve scrambled a chopper.
Does Lecter know we have the note?
It was found in</ i> <i>a routine cleanup. </ i>
<i>They don' t open his mail? </ i>
CRAWFORD:
<i>X- rays only. </ i>
<i>Where' s Lecter? </ i>
<i>The holding cage. </ i>
<i>Can he see his cell? </ i>
But he' s been there</ i> <i>almost half an hour. </ i>
We got to buy time, Jack.
Dr. Chilton.
<i>Yes? </ i>
Tell him to pull the circuit breakers on Lecter' s hall.
He' il be in a hurry, pissed off, too busy to answer questions.
Don' t touch the note, okay?
Graham' s on his way.
Listen up!
We' ve got a note coming in on the fly... possibly from the Tooth Fairy.
Number One Priority.
It has to go back to Lecter' s cell within the hour... unmarked.
We' il need Hair and Fibre, Latent Prints, then Documents.
I' il walk it through myself.
Let' s go, people!
<i>My dear Dr. Lecter.: </ i>
<i>I' m delighted... </ i> <i>that you' ve taken an interest in me. </ i>
<i>" Dare I? "Of course I do. </ i>

I swear they ought to tear the whole fucking place down.
- How much longer do we have?
- Ten minutes, max.
BOWMAN: lnstructions for answering... were probably in the section Lecter tore out.
Why not just throw the whole note away?
It was full of compliments.
He couldn' t bear to part with them.
Now we can mash just a little.
You' re so sly.
But so am l.
<i>Aniline dyes and coloured inks</ i> <i>are transparent to infrared. </ i>
<i>On the end, that' s a "P," or possibly an "R." </ i>

Publication.
We know this guy reads the <i>Tattler</ i>.
That' s in his note, right?
The Tooth Fairy, they made that up.
Three "T' s" and an "R" in "Tattler."
How do you communicate through a tabloid?
- You got what?
- Personals.
Maybe he wants Lecter to answer him through the personals?
- That could be it.
- We need proofs of the pages... before the next <i>Tattler</ i>' s published!
<i>Investigator Graham</ i> <i>interests me. </ i>
<i>Not your standard gumshoe, </ i> <i>is he? </ i>
<i>Purposeful looking. </ i>

Baltimore postmark on the envelope.
<i>It' s set to run this afternoon. </ i>
Chicago field office is sending the text through now.
- "Dear Pilgrim."
Lecter called him a pilgrim when we talked.
"You honour me.
You' re very beautiful. "Christ!
"I offer 100 prayers for your safety.
"Find help in John 6: 22, 8: 16...
"9: 1, Luke 1: 7."
- Has to be.
We' ve got 19 minutes to get in a message if we can break this.
The <i>Tattler</ i> can' t hold its presses any longer.
It' s simple.
They only needed cover against casual readers.
- I' m thinking it' s a book code.
- Code?
The numbers after could be line and letter.
- Bible?
Same with "Jonah 6: 8."
<i>He wasn' t using a Bible. </ i>
Then the Tooth Fairy named the book to use.
He specified it in his note, in the part Lecter tore out.
BOWMAN:
ln a mental hospital...
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago, to find out... where he buried the Princeton student.
He gave them a recipe for dip.
lf we sweat him, we lose the connection.
lf the Tooth Fairy picked the book... he knew Lecter would have it in his cell.
- Can we get a list of his books?
- From Chilton, maybe.
Wait!
Rankin and Willingham, when they tossed his cell... took Polaroids so they could put everything back in place.
Ask them to meet me with pictures of his bookshelves!
Where?
The Library!
I' m leery of letting Lecter' s message run... without knowing what it says.
We keep working on the code.
I don' t like this any better than you.
But it' s our best shot.

Oh, my God!
Hello?
Jack, it' s Lloyd Bowman.
I solved the code.
You need to know what it says right now.
Okay, Lloyd.
It says, "Graham home, Marathon, Florida.

CRAWFORD:
<i>Bowman just broke the code. </ i>
- What does it say?
Now, listen to me.
Stay on</ i> <i>the phone when I tell you. </ i>
Tell me now.
Lecter gave the bastard your home address.
<i>Wait. </ i>
Mum?
WlLL:
No, Lecter just suggested it to him.
I hate this, Molly.
I' m sorry.
- It' s a sick feeling.
- I know it is.
Crawford' s brother owns this place.
No one in the world knows you' re here.
I' d just as soon not talk about Crawford.
Beneath the yellow folder... you' il find your latest rejection slip... from the archives.
It was brought to me by mistake with some of my archives mail.
<i>I' m afraid I opened it</ i> <i>without looking. </ i>
Sorry.
I think we' il remove Dr. Lecter' s toilet seat.
<i>Atlanta P. D. nailed him. </ i>
He had a fake Bureau lD... and was trying to get the Leeds family autopsy photos.
It' s a Federal beef, so Atlanta kicked him back to us.
I' d like nothing better than to see the dirt sandwich... pulling five at Leavenworth.
But maybe there' s a better way to handle this.
What' s that?
I think we ought to give him a story.
The Tooth Fairy' s ugly... and he' s impotent with members of the opposite sex.
Also, he sexually molests his male victims.
While they' re alive?
Sorry, I can' t go into those details.
But we do also speculate... that he' s the product of an incestuous home.
No wonder the creep' s such a loser, right?
That' s a tip we got from Dr. Lecter, by the way.
So it' s true that Lecter' s helping with your investigation?
Yes, it' s true.
The Doctor was offended a bottom- feeding lowlife like... the Tooth Fairy would consider himself in the same league.
Okay, tell me about this place you got here.
Will, your little Washington hideaway.
This is an apartment I' m borrowing... till this creep goes down in flames.
I keep copies of the evidence so I can work on it at night.
Make sure you can read the name on that building.
All right, I got enough.
lf my story draws the Fairy in an attack on Graham... and you nail the scumbag, I get an exclusive.
When we see the story, we' il consider what to do... about your sealed indictment.
All right, it was a pleasure doing business with you, chumps.
I feel like I need a shower.
You okay with this?
So, yeah, I' m okay with it.
I wish we had something better... but there' s only ten days till the next full moon.
We' ve got to rattle his cage.
We' il stake out this apartment, put snipers on the rooftops.

<i>Is that your fucking name</ i> <i>on the sign? </ i>
Where am l?
What am I doing here?
Atoning, Mr. Lounds.
I haven' t seen your face.
<i>I couldn' t possibly</ i> <i>identify you. </ i>
I work for the <i>National Tattler</ i>.
It would pay... a big reward for me.
I mean, a half a million... or a million, maybe.
Do you know who I am, Mr. Lounds?
And I don' t want to know.
You know, believe me.
DOLARHYDE:
According to you, I' m a vicious, perverted sexual failure... a "bottom- feeding lowlife"... who' s about to "go down in flames."
<i>I think you know now, don' t you? </ i>
Yes.
No.
But I would like to.
I really want to understand... and then all my readers could understand, too.
I am not a man.
<i>I began as one... </ i> but each being that I change makes me... more than a man... as you will witness.
I don' t need to see you.
But you must, Mr. Lounds.
You' re a reporter.
You' re here to report.
Open your eyes and look at me.
No.
I' il staple your eyelids to your forehead.
No!
Open your eyes!
Oh, my dear God Jesus!
Oh, God!
Do you want to know what I am?
More than anything.
I was afraid to ask.
Do you see now?
Oh, God.
DOLARHYDE:
Do you see?
Yes.
Mrs. Leeds in human form.
- Do you see?
- Yes.
- Mrs. Jacobi changing.
- Oh, my God.
Do you see?
Mrs. Jacobi reborn.
<i>Do you see? </ i>
Mrs. Leeds reborn.
- Do you see?
- Please, no.
No?
No what?
Not me.
Why did you write lies, Mr. Lounds?
Graham told me to lie.
It wasn' t me.
- Will you tell the truth now?
- Yes!
About me?
- My work?
- Oh, yes.
My becoming?
Yeah.
I am the Dragon, and you call me insane!
You are privy to a great becoming... and you recognise nothing.
You are an ant in the afterbirth.
It is in your nature to do one thing correctly.
Before me, you rightly tremble.
Lounds. </ i>
You owe me awe.
Read.
That' s all, Mr. Lounds.
<i>You did very well. </ i>
Will you let me go now?
Soon.
<i>There' s one more way I can</ i> <i>help you to better understand. </ i>
I want to understand.
And I' m really gonna be fair... from now on.
You know that.
Hello?
<i>I have had</ i> <i>a great privilege. </ i>
<i>I have seen with... </ i> <i>wonder and awe the strength</ i> <i>of the Great Red Dragon. </ i>
<i>He has helped me to understand</ i> <i>his splendour... </ i> <i>and now I want to serve him. </ i>
<i>He knows you made me lie, </ i> <i>Will Graham. </ i>
<i>Because I was forced to lie... </ i> <i>he will be more merciful to me</ i> <i>than to you. </ i>
<i>Hello? </ i>
<i>Oh, God, no! </ i>
We can let this tie us up in knots... or we can learn from it.
Maybe even use it to catch the bastard.
He had to have a van or panel truck... to move Lounds around in that big old wheelchair.
Go on.
He had to already have the wheelchair... or know where to get one fast.
It' s an antique, not something you' d find in the house.
Does it strike anybody that he set this up in a hurry?
By Tuesday morning he' s in Chicago, snatching Lounds.
He either lives in the Chicago area... or he' s within a driving radius of... call it six hours.
Find out in this area where the <i>Tattler</ i> was available... for early distribution Monday night.
Maybe a newsie remembers an odd customer.
Lloyd, this cassette, enhance the audio.
<i>Maybe you can pick up</ i> <i>something in the background. </ i>
I want the maker, date, possible sources.
Graham and I will coordinate from Chicago.
Look, there' s not gonna be any answers in Chicago, Jack.
I mean, Lounds, that was a bonus.
That was a chance to show off.
It doesn' t even fit his pattern.
The Leeds and the Jacobis are what he needs.
I think I should go back to Baltimore.
After what he tried to pull?
Lecter picked up on something in the missing part of the note.
Not a name, but something, enough to narrow the search.
Even if he did, he won' t tell you.
Not unless I can offer him something.
<i>Congratulations. </ i>
That was most artistic, the way you disposed of Mr. Lounds.
Your cell looks bigger with no books in it.
I hadn' t noticed.
Oh, you will.
I have other resources.
Did you enjoy it?
Your first murder?
Why shouldn' t it feel good?
It does to God.
Why, only last week in Texas, he dropped a church roof... on the heads of 34 of his worshippers... as they were grovelling through a hymn.
He wouldn' t begrudge you one journalist.
Put me next to him, Doctor.
Oh, Will.
Where' s the fun in that?
He' il have to take his chances, too.
A roof can fall on anybody.
But not on Molly and Josh, I take it.
<i>Not yet, anyway. </ i>
First he kills the pet, then the family.
Freddy was your pet.
They' re safe now.
No one will ever be safe around you, Will.
And that blackout was an especially nice touch.
What else was in that note, Doctor?
Put me next to him!
That' s what you want, isn' t it?
Twice?
Give him a chance to kill me.
Seduce me with your wares.
Plus computer access to the AMA archives.
One hour a week under supervision, of course... but it' s a one- time offer.
It expires the minute I walk out of here.
Bit measly, don' t you think?
Turn it down, then.
Are these threats, William?
Or maybe you' ve got nothing left to sell.
- Seen the Blake, have you?
- Yes.
No, you' ve looked but not seen.
Transformation is the key.
The man- dragon... his ugliness transformed by power.
Look for extensive tattooing... and corrective surgery, most likely to the face.
Come on, I' m past that already and you know it.
Give me what I need.
How is he choosing the women?
I' ve already suggested how.
The answer was in front of you.
- You looked but didn' t see.
- Bullshit!
No riddles!
Just tell me.
It' s your turn.
I asked you before for a small courtesy... and you responded rudely.
Before I tell you anything more... you will make certain arrangements for me.
What kind of arrangements?
Oh, nothing much.
Shall we say dinner and a show?
You ready to tell me what kind of outing this is?
Nope.
You' re just full of surprises, aren' t you, D?
Yep.
<i>He' s about six feet away. </ i>
Can you smell him?
Yeah.
Now, he' s a little noisy, but he' s sedated, I assure you.
<i>Doctor Hassler' s about to fix</ i> <i>his broken tooth. </ i>
Glad you could come, Ms. McClane.
<i>We appreciate the infrared film, </ i> <i>by the way. </ i>
Two more steps.
I' il put your left hand on the edge of the table.
Now, he' s right in front of you.
Take your time.
- D?
- I' m here.
You go ahead.
Here.
Why don' t you try this?
Nine steps from the front door to the clock... and three more to this room.
Force of habit.
That beautiful tiger, this house, this music....
I don' t think anybody knows you at all, D.
Everybody wonders about you, though.
Especially the women.
What do they want to know?
They find you... very mysterious and interesting.
Did they tell you how I look?
They said that you have a remarkable body.
That you' re very sensitive about your face but you shouldn' t be.
Oh, and... they asked me if... you are as strong as you look.
And?
I said I didn' t know.
Where the hell are you, D?
Here you are.
Do you want to know what I think about it?
Now, would you show me where the bathroom is?
I have to do a little work.
- lf I' m keeping you from work...
- I want you to be here.
It' s just a tape I need to watch.
<i>It won' t take long. </ i>
- No.
May I keep the music?
What' s it about?
Some people I' m going to meet.
So then... it' s what?
Some kind of homework?
It' s homework.
Yeah.
That' s a good idea.
It' s so important to be prepared.
My God, are you ever!
I won' t give her to you.
No.
Please, just for a little while.
You' re hurting me!
No... she' s nice.
She' s okay.
I had a really terrific time last night.
But this morning you seem like a different person.
- ls something wrong?
- I have to go now.
- I have to go away.
- Where?
On a trip.
- When will I see you again?
Now.
<i>Here are the Jacobis' </ i> <i>personal effects, as discussed. </ i>
<i>I hope these things</ i> <i>might help you. </ i>
<i>Good hunting.
Byron Metcalf. </ i>
<i>How many more</ i> <i>times are we going to watch this? </ i>
WlLL:
"See them living," he said, "right in front of you."
<i>It' s something about</ i> <i>these home movies. </ i>
Lecter keeps saying, "You looked, but didn' t see."
Lecter says a lot of things.
Sad damn thing.
But we already knew that.
We can' t afford to let Lecter waste our --
Again.
Your dissertation must be nearly finished, Mr. Crane.
Nearly.
It' s nice to be able to connect a face with a name... after all our correspondence.
But, you know, you don' t look like I imagined you looked.
What did you think I looked like?
Different.
Thank you.
Right there!
That' s what he wanted the bolt cutter for.
To cut that padlock and go in through the basement.
But that' s a different door.
I don' t get it.
The one I saw was flush steel with deadbolts.
Beginning of January, I think.
It' s in here somewhere.
Think he cased the house with the old door?
He brought the bolt cutter, didn' t he?
He was sure he' d need it.
Why case it two months in advance and not check it?
like at the Leeds' house.
He must' ve seen the glass when he walked in the neighbourhood.
You can' t see that door from the yard.
There' s a porch lattice in the way.
Jack, he knew the inside of the houses.
Remarkable, isn' t it?
Two hundred years old.
Yet so fresh.
<i>So vivid. </ i>
He almost looks alive, doesn' t he?
We' ve just gotten a report here from the....
<i>Do you still have</ i> <i>the Jacobis' check stubs... </ i> <i>and credit card statements? </ i>
We' re looking for any kind of service call or purchase... that might' ve required a stranger... to enter the house.
METCALF:
CRAWFORD:
I know we checked that... but now we got to go back to before January.
WlLL:
But please hurry.
No collar.
Metcalf says -- WlLL:
No collar.
The dog had no collar in a neighbourhood of dogs... but he knew which was theirs.
Same with the Jacobis' cat.
WlLL:
He knew about the pane of glass.
<i>He knew the layout. </ i>
<i>He knew how to get in. </ i>
Every goddamn thing he needed to know was on this....
Oh, Jesus.
ls Metcalf still on the phone?
Give it!
You said Niles Jacobi took a few keepsakes.
METCALF:
I need to know if something he took was a home video.
METCALF:
Yes?
It' s Chromalux.
We just got a fax.
An incident at the Brooklyn Museum.
<i>A guy attacked two employees, </ i> <i>and get this... </ i> ate the Blake painting.
That' s him.
It' s got to be.
lf that painting meant so much to him, why destroy it?
<i>And why didn' t he kill</ i> <i>those two women at the museum? </ i>
They both got a good look at him.
Maybe he' s trying to stop.
Mr. Crawford, all you' ve got is a hunch.
I' ve got 382 employees, and they' ve got a union.
Not without a court order.
There are privacy issues.
The company' s exposure.
One of the employees has already killed 1 1 people... that we know of.
lf he gets away tonight... what' s the company' s exposure on that?
- I' il get our lawyers here -- - We don' t have time for that.
We' re looking for a white male, 25 to 35...
- No --
Please.
He' s strong.
He' s possibly a bodybuilder.
He might have some kind of facial disfigurement.
He drives a van or a panel truck.
That sounds like Mr. D.
Oh, my God.
Who' s Mr. D?
Francis Dolarhyde, Manager of Technical Services.
What does he do exactly?
He maintains the equipment for tape transfers.
Would he have access to people' s home videotapes?
He has access to every tape that comes through here.
Thanks for dinner, and thanks for letting me vent.
Look, no problemo.
Reba, listen, I know it' s not my place to say this....
Go on.
I mean, what do you really know about the guy?
And I promise I' il give it some thought.
- Hey, have a great vacation.
- See you in a week.
- Good night.
REBA:
RALPH:
Ralph, just 'cause I' m feeling vulnerable --
DOLARHYDE:
You wandered around in the house while I was asleep, didn' t you?
The other night, did you find something odd?
Did you take it and show it to somebody?
Did you do that?
What is it?
What' s happening?
- Sit still or he' il hear us!
- Who will?
He' s upstairs.
He wants you, Reba.
I thought he was gone, but now he' s back.
D, you' re scaring me.
I didn' t want to give you to him.
I did a thing for you today so he couldn' t have you.
I was wrong.
You made me weak and then you hurt me.
No.
No, you can' t have her!
Please don' t let him have me.
I' m for you.
You like me.
I know you like me.
Take me with you.
Take you with me?
Put out your hand.
<i>Feel this.
That' s a shotgun. </ i>
A 1 2- gauge magnum.
Do you know what it' il do?
I wish I could have trusted you.
I wanted to trust you.
So did you.
- Please don' t hurt me now.
- It' s all over for me.
- Where are you?
- I can' t leave you to him.
Do you know what he' il do?
He' il bite you to death.
He' il hurt you so bad!
I can' t let that happen.
- It' s better if you go with me.
- Yes, God, get us out of here!
- I' il shoot you and then myself.
- I have to shoot you.
- No....
I can' t do it.
[Gunshot]
Three steps to the clock.
<i>From the clock to the door, </ i> <i>nine more. </ i>
What the hell is that?
That' s the place.
Goddamn it!
All units, that' s his house that' s burning.
FBl!
Francis Dolarhyde!
Where is he?
He' s in there.
You know that?
He shot himself in the face.
I put my hand in it.
He set fire to the house.
He was on the floor, and l --
You all right?
That' s all I need.
See how you' re doing.
Sure, why not?
Who could resist a charmer like me?
You know, whatever part of him was still human... was only kept alive because of you.
You probably saved some lives.
Okay?
You drew a man with a freak on his back.
I should have known.
No, sometimes you don' t.
Trust me, I' ve been there.
Listen to me.
There was plenty wrong with Dolarhyde... but there' s nothing wrong with you.
Except your hair.
Your hair is a train wreck.
Can we please do something about that?
For next time, maybe?
Please?
REBA:
Thank you.
Just get some rest.
You' re gonna be fine.
We found this in his safe.
Thought you might want to take the first look.
You' ve earned it.
WlLL:
<i>When I read his journal, </ i> <i>it was sad. </ i>
It was just so sad.
I couldn' t help feeling sorry for him.
He wasn' t born a monster.
This guy was made one through years of abuse.
- Hey, Dad, can we make s' mores?
- S' mores?
- Yeah, s' mores.
- Yeah, you' re on.
- Go look in the pantry.
Crawford.
Those remains you found in the rubble.
- They' re not Dolarhyde' s.
- What are you talking about?
- His damn dentures were there.
<i>- But not his bones. </ i>
Wrong DNA.
Then whose are they?
Saint Louis P. D. is looking for... a Chromalux employee named Ralph Mandy.
He should be on vacation, so nobody missed him for a week.
- What is taking him so long?
- Are you kidding?
It takes him 20 minutes to get out of bed in the morning.
Yeah, but now I have a serious marshmallow jones.
Josh, what are you doing?
<i>It' s Jack. </ i>
He' s still alive. </ i>
<i>I' m scrambling everything</ i> <i>that rolls or flies... </ i> <i>but they' il take time to arrive. </ i>
<i>Will? </ i>
<i>Christ, Will, where are you? </ i>
Drop it.
Do it now, gumshoe.
Your son is about to change.
<i>Then your wife. </ i>
<i>You can watch. </ i>
<i>Then I' il take care of you. </ i>
Look at you.
I' ve never seen a child as disgusting as you!
You pissed your pants?
How dare you!
You dirty little beast.
You want me to cut it off?
Want me to do that, you little freak?
You want me to cut it off?
Do you?
Don' t cry at me, you little faggot!
Apologise!
Say, "I' m sorry, Daddy!
I' m a dirty little beast.
"I' m a freak." Say it!
- No.
- Say it!
- Dad!
- Say it, or I will cut it off!
"I' m a dirty little beast.
<i>" And no one will ever love me. "</ i>
Run!
Get down!
You okay?
MOLLY [From downstairs]:
Mum?
Will?
<i>Where are you guys? </ i>
<i>I thought I heard</ i> <i>some kind of.... </ i>
<i>Will? </ i>
Molly, get down!
[Gasps]
What?
Shoot him.
Mummy?
<i>My dear Will.: </ i>
<i>You must be healed by now. </ i>
<i>On the outside, at least. </ i>
<i>I hope you' re not too ugly. </ i>
<i>What a collection of scars</ i> <i>you have! </ i>
<i>And be grateful. </ i>
<i>Our scars have the power</ i> <i>to remind us the past was real. </ i>
<i>We live in a primitive time, </ i> <i>don' t we, Will? </ i>
<i>Neither savage nor wise. </ i>
<i>Half measures</ i> <i>are the curse of it. </ i>
<i>A rational society would either</ i> <i>kill me or put me to some use. </ i>
<i>Do you dream much, Will? </ i>
<i>I think of you often. </ i>
<i>Your old friend, </ i> <i>Hannibal Lecter. </ i>
[Dramatic instrumental music]
<i>There' s someone here to see you. </ i>
<i>I said you' d probably refuse. </ i>
Though she' s far too pretty, if you ask me.
I' il tell her you said no.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
Do they feed us now, you think?
My children, my children!
We must heal the divisions between us!
North and South must stand united.
What happens at the finish?
Then we have ourselves a rowdy dow!
Ain' t you never been to a theatre before?
No.
Mr Legree, lay down your whip.
Miss Elisa join hands with Mr. Shelby.
And Topsy.
Dear little Topsy.
Cradle Uncle Tom' s head.
Leave the nigger dead.
Down with the Union!
Down with the Union!
For the blood of the Irish.
Bill, get down!
Somebody' s popped the Butcher!
Who' s man are you?
Speak smart and speak up!
What' s he saying?
I think he' s making his peace with God.
To hell with that!
He makes his peace with me.
I' m hearing your confession tonight, you Irish whore!
Who' s man are you?
We speak English in this country.
... you to speak English with this knife!
Who' s man are you?
Who' s man are you?
Well that didn' t tell us very much.
Fine waist coat.
Shame, I don' t think it can be mended!
Will I keep it as a souvenir?
Where' s Legree?
Where' s Topsy?
Intermission is over.
Now that was bloody Shakespearian.
What?
Do you know who Shakeapeare was, sonny?
He was the fellow who wrote the King James' Bible.
Mr., I don' t know what you are talking about...
Because you' re an ignorant Irish welp!
Just like your father.
That' s it.
Tear my head off and destruct the world.
Just like the other stupid Irish in this country!
That' s why I never ran with your dad.
Get off me you crazy bastard!
It means if you' re not strong, you' d better be smart.
I don' t know if your being too clever or too dumb.
But whatever it is, remember this much.
For all his faults, your father was a man who loved his people.
Amsterdam.
Amsterdam.
New York is calling you.
Look at that.
What in Christ' s name is that?
Stir it around a few times.
A jig, doing a jig!
A little keep sake.
Good on ya, sir.
Come upstairs with me Bill.
Have I ever had you before?
So you don' t call me by my christian name.
Bill.
My god you' re alright!
I heard the news and came over as quick as I could.
As timely as the angel of death.
You' re not suggesting that I would stoop to what your suggesting?
Stop slabbering.
If I thought it was you...... you' d be in a wooden coat.
I' ve got a hole in my shoulder and it hurts...... so have a drink and shut up.
Or shut up and get out.
I believe I' il have a drink.
Carefull, Tweedy the morts are frenchified!
No, I' m clean. go
Jenny.
Bill.
I' il wrap you up.
It' s gotta be tight.
Loves to make me cry.
You can take it!
There' s my boy.
It' s alright.
To the Butcher!
We' re all much obliged.
Forever.
To the Butcher!
Why don' t you get out of here, Johnny?
Go!
Yes!
You!
Belt down!
Try it and I' il bite ya.
You were gonna bite me.
I dont think you want me.
Find out.
Oh, Jenny!
I can' t sleep.
I hope you don' t mind us laying here, sir?
Whatever takes your fancy, young friend.
Is your shoulder keeping you up?
I don' t sleep too much.
I sleep with one eye open.
I only got one eye.
How old are you Amsterdam?
Not too sure.
Never did figure it.
I' m 47.
47 years old.
You know how I stayed alive this long?
All these years.
Fear!
The spectacle of fearsome acts.
Somebody steals from me, I cut off his hands.
He offends me, I cut out his tongue.
He rises against me, I cut off his head, stick it on a pike!
Raise it high up, so all in the streets can see.
That' s what preserves the order of things.
Fear.
Who was he?
A nobody.
A coward.
What an end that would have been.
I killed the last honourable man 15 years ago.
Since then...
You' ve seen his portrait downstairs?
Has your mouth been glued up with juice?
I asked you a question!
I said I' ve seen it, sir...
You got a murderous rage in you.
So much life boiling up in you.
That' s good!
The priest and me lived by the same principles.
Only faith divided us.
He gave me this you know?
That was the finest beating I ever took.
My face was pulp.
My guts pierced.
My ribs all messed up.
When he came to finish me...
... I couldn' t look him in the eye.
He spared me because....... he wanted me to live in shame.
This was a great man.
A great man.
So I cut out the eye that looked away.
Sent it to him wrapped in blue paper.
I would' ve cut them both out if I could afford being blind.
I rose up again with a full heart...... and buried him in his own blood.
Well done!
He was the only man I killed worth remembering.
I never had a son.
Civilisation is crumbling.
God bless you!
If you' ve got anything to say...... now is the time to say it.
Who is he to you, Jenny?
I was 12 years old.
I was living in a doorway.
He took me in.
Took care of me in his own way.
After they cut out the baby...
He doesn' t fancy girls that scared up.
You should know, in your own mind...... that he never laid a hand on me till I asked him too.
Who are you?
Who are you?
Gentlemen, you are most welcome to this palace of enchantment...... with visions to rival the tales of Sheherazade and the Arabian Nights!
Flex your head to the teutonic beauty!
... of these creatures.
Gentlemen, you see our caged birds well!
How would you like to make them sing?
They could be singing for you.
May God put the spirit of the holy steel in my spine...... and the love of the blessed Virgin in my heart.
Amen.
Easy now.
What did you say?
He' s not who he says he is.
He' s not who he says he is?
Count you blessings he considers you a friend!
The only thing he considers every day and night is how to kill you!
Those eyes want me to take them out for you!
I' il bury it up you fundunem where it belongs!
I can read right through them!
They' re empty...
His name is Vallon.
Don' t do it Bill!
His name is Vallon!
Curious people these celestials.
You know why they use short sleeves?
So everyone can see he' s got nothing stashed.
I hope it doesn' t become a fashion.
Johnny?
Get up!
Ladies and gentlemen, if I may have your kind attention.
As some of you have surely noticed...... our friend and benifactor, Mr Cutting..... is tonight wearing a waistcoat of certain distinction!
May we appeal to him, to favour us...... with another exciting exhibition.
Of skill.
Courage.
Daring and drama!
What' s gonna happen?
The spider' s kiss!
The wheel of death!
William Tell!
The butterfly!
The spider' s kiss!
The Butcher' s apprentice!
The Butcher' s apprentice!
A command performance!
Where have you been?
A command performance indeed.
I want you to get out of here!
And for this, I must beg the indulgence...... of my former...... assistent in matters of impailment...... the Butcher' s original apprentice.
What do you say, Jen?
One more time for the sweet souvenir.
Come on!
Don' t do it!
She' il be alright.
Remember this?
Of course!
You may feel more comfortable without that garment, Miss Everdeane!
You' il have to filch me a new one, Bill!
Anything in your pockets tonight?
I ain' t started working yet.
What about that locket I gave you?
Apologies my dear.
Pick it up.
Whoopsie daisy!
Now its good and broke!
I can' t seem to get anything right tonight.
You got the sand to give' m a grand finale?
Maybe when you' re aiming a little straighter.
Enough of this heathen music.
Get rid of these goddamn monkeys.
Strike up boys!
This is a night for Americans!
Jenny!
Hats off!
We hold in our hearts the memory of our fallen brothers...... whose blood stains the very streets...... we walk today..
Also on this night, we pay tribute to the leader of our enemies.
Fighting for what he believed in.
To defeat my enemy, I extinguish his life...... and consume him as I consume these flames.
In honour of Priest Vallon.
In honour of Priest Vallon!
That' s a wound!
I want you all to meet the son of Priest Vallon.
I took him under my wing...... and see how I' m repaid.
He saved my life one day so he could kill me the next...... like a sneak thief.
Instead of fighting like a man.
Unworthy of a noble name.
That' il do Mcgloin.
Spread him out.
I hate blackies.
You.. you get to watch.
This is fresh meat!
We need to tenderise this meat a bit.
Alright, lets kiss goodnight to that pretty face of yours!
No.......!
What' il it be then.
Rib or chop.
Loin or shank.
The liver!
The spleen!
The kidney!
The lung!
The liver!
The tongue!
The heart!
The heart!
The heart?
This boy has no heart.
Then kill him!
He ain' t earned the death!
He ain' t earned the death of my hands!
He' il walk amongst you marked with shame.
Worthy of Barnum' s museum of wonders.
God' s only man, speared by the Butcher.
Here.
Here.
This way.
Come on.
I want to show you something.
My mother' s bones share this grave.
I' ve saved 20 cents out of every dollar I' ve ever earned since....... I was thirteen.
That' s 215 dollars.
This is what I wanted to show you.
This is where we' re going to go, as soon as you get better....... San Fransisco, California.
You can have anything you want out there.
These men are pulling gold right out of the river.
With their own hands.
We' re here and need to get there.
Start here.
Go down 'round here.
Up to San Francisco.
The shortest way to go.
Will you go with me?
Or even aim it.
An audience with yor mangled friend is all I want.
I' ve 44 notches on my club.
Do you know what they are for?
To remind me of what I owe God when I die.
My father was killed in battle too.
In Ireland, in the streets.
Fighting those who were taking their privilege.
What only could be got and held...... by the decimation of a race.
That war is a thousand years old and more.
We never expected it to follow us here.
It didn' t.
It was waiting for us when we landed.
Your father tried to carve out a corner in this country for his tribe.
That was him.
That was his Dead Rabbits.
I often wondered, if he' d lived a bit longer...... would he have wanted it to be more.
Why did you rifle through his pockets then?
For safekeeping.
I thought maybe you could do with it.
Blood stays on the blade.
That' s a sorry looking pelt.
And it' s been so nice and quiet for the last three months.
Tell me, this charge.
Does it sit on easy with you?
No.
Not uneasy, Bill.
I wouldn' t say that.
But..... my allegiance is to the law.
I' m paid to uphold the law.
What in heaven' s name are you talking about?
You may have misgivings, but don' t go believing that, Jack.
That way lies damnation.
I' m in no danger of damnation, Bill.
Here' s the thing.
I don' t give a fuck about your moral conflicts..... you meatheaded shit sack.
That' s more or less the thing.
I want you to go out there.
None of your little minions..
I want you to go out there...... and I want you...... to punish, the person...... who' s responsible...... for murdering this poor little rabbit.
Is that understood?
Right!
Help yourself to some decent meat on the way out.
Damn it!
Is that you, boy?
I didn' t mean nothing by that shot you know?
You scared me is all.
You know I' d never do you harm.
Come out now, lad.
Remember your father and me?
Are you to young to remember your Uncle Jack?
The times we had.
You know I won' t hurt you.
This is bad for everybody.
What' s next, dead politicians?
I could spare half a dozen of you...... easier than I can spare him.
Still, I think it shows dash.
Give the boy some time, we' il settle with a good dust up.
The lads!
There are more of us coming off the ships each day.
I heard 15, 000 Irish a week.
And we' re afraid of the Natives!
Get all of us together....... we ain' t got a gang..... we got an army.
And all we need is a spark.
One spark, to wake us all up.
It was me who played you false.
I' d take it back if I could.
Take it back?
Johnny, I ought to kill you!
Get out of the Points and don' t come back..
Where are you going, boil?
Come along.
Come on.
Tell us John, what' s the trouble?
No trouble, Bill.
Still hiding out with your friends?
You always were a Native, as far as I' m interested, John.
Till you became a stag.
Do you want to know what a Native is?
A Native is a man, who' s willing to give his life...... for his country.
Like my father done.
Are you willing to do that, my young friend?
John?
Johnny?
Johnny?
I' il get you off.
It hurts too much.
Just kill me.
Just kill me.
Please.
Please.
Please.
I' m sorry, Johnny.
Oh, Mary mother of God, pray for us sinners...... on the day of our death... amen.
Rest in peace, Ma.
What are you doing here, boil?
What' s that nigger doing in this church?
What' s a Dead Rabbit doing with the Natives, huh?
No niggers among the Natives.
Niggers as robbers is one thing...... but niggers in a church, that' s something else!
You run with the Natives, you go pray with the Natives!
You' re going to wind up on a stake like your man did!
McGloin?
Father!
Jezus, do you know there' s a nigger in your church?
Jezus!
The earth turns...... but we don' t feel it move.
And one night you look up...... one spark and the skie' s on fire.
It' s a touching spectacle.
We' il come back when you' re ready for us.
The past is the torch that lights our way.
Where our fathers have shown us the path.
We shall follow..
Our faith is the weapon most feared by our enemies...... for thereby shall we lift our people up...... against those who will destroy us.
Our name is called the Dead Rabbits, to remind all of our suffering...... and as a call to those who suffer still...... to join our ranks.
However so far they may have strayed from our common home across the sea.
For with great numbers, must come great strength.
For the salvation of our people.
We don' t want your business.
How many other men live here?
You all have to register.
You can' t force me to join no army.
Have you got 300 dollars?
Of course not!
Who the hell' s got 300 dollars?
If you are drafted, release from militairy service can only be secured...... for 300 dollars, according to the conscription act.
300 Dollars?
Otherwise you have to serve!
Who the hell' s got 300 dollars?
You have to serve, sir!
You tell me!
Boys!
I was born here, sir.
You immigrated here!.
Sweet jezus.
War does terrible things to men.
Get back up town, where you belong!.
300 dollars.
It' s another rich man' s war!
Sir, I request an audience with this man.
Don' t they speak English in New York anymore!
Don' t understand.
You do speak English!
I wonder if miss Everdeane can angle her rifle in another direction?
I wonder Mr. Vallon, if you understand the value of this sort of publicity?
The Archbishop himself, shoulder to shoulder with half the Irish in the Five Points.
I' m offering my boy, to form an alliance with you...... against Bill Cutting and his slate of Native candidates.
I' il negotiate a handsome fee, for every Irish vote...... you send Tammany' s way, in the coming elections.
I need a new friend in the Five Points, son.
I' d like that friend to be you.
Now just a moment, Mr. Tweed.
Suppose we do get you those votes.
Would you back an Irish candidate of my chosing..
I don' t think so.
What if we get you all the Irish votes?
Mr. Vallon, that will only happen in the reign of Queen Dick!
Beg your pardon?
That means it will never happen.
Now I might be persuaded to back an Irish candidate...... for, let' s say alderman.
We' ve already got an Irish alderman.
So we have, that' s why...
What' s bigger than an alderman?
Sheriff!
Sheriff!
Alright, Mr Tweed, you back an Irishman for sheriff...... of the city and county of New York....... and we' il get him elected.
I love the Irish, son..... but higher than alderman you shall never climb.
Why not?
For one thing, no man living can consolidate the Irish vote.
I can!
And for another, I mean no offence...... no one' s yet found an Irish candidate...... for sheriff worth voting for.
Monk!
Here.
Got me looking as sober as me own grandfather!
He was a great man, I' m sure.
He was a drunken bastard.
Can I say what I want?
That' s why I wanted you.
Our elected representatives are a gang of thieves!
Who swear to better our lot...... while dipping their hands deep into our pockets.
I stand shoulder to shoulder with community leaders like Bill Cutting....... against any, an all in roads in our democracy.
I' il see to it, that no one takes away...... what you earned by pluck and application.
To invading hordes of Hibernians.
Go to the polls and put your mark...... next to the name Walter McGinn.
Against the potatoes weeders, like them over there...... thieving our jobs.
Why should so many Irish die down south...... when the first war to win...... is not down in Dixie, but right here...... in these streets!
Who' s the finest streetfighter in the Five Points?
Monk!
That' s right and let the whole damn city hear it!
That man was right born for this.
He' s killed 44 men and laid low a couple of hundred more.
Is that right?
Right.
I should have run him for mayor!
Alright, line 'm up.
It' s election day!
Come on, you bastard.
We need your vote.
Bastard?
I fought for you nigger...... I lost an arm for you!
Well, that' s a start.
Come on.
Rise and shine, rise and shine.
This great country of ours, even hop fiends get their vote.
Less heart and more haste, darling.
Where are you going?
I already voted today.
Cast for Monk and Tammany, by god!
Twice.
Twice?
Only twice?
You call that doing your civic duty?
Come with me.
Oh no, you don' t.
Get back and sit down.
Here' s another one!
Clean him up good.
Shave the beards off boys and send them back to vote again.
What our great city needs is a new court house.
Now I propose it should be a modest, economical structure.
Excuse me one moment.
What is it?
Monk' s already won by 3, 000 more votes, then there are voters.
Only 3?
Make it 20, 30.
We don' t need a victory, we need a Roman triumph.
We don' t have anymore ballots.
Remember the first rule of politics...... ballots don' t make the results..... the counters do.
Keep counting..
It' s from Bill.
Monk?
Citizens of the Five Points!
Mr. Cutting is attempting to draw me...... into an argument...... that would no doubt end in bloodshed...... and the compromising of my office.
What do you think?
Shall I engage in silence, this relic of the ancient law...... or, shall I be your chosen voice...... in a new testament, in a new world?
There you are, Bill.
The people have spoken
The very notion of violent reprisal benumbs them.
Come on up.
Let' s see if we can resolve our...... grievances the democratic way..
That my friends, is the minority vote.
Now you tasted my mutton, how do you like it?
Notch 45, you Irish bug bastard.
Why don' t you burn him?
See if his ashes turn green.
Fortune favours them all!
You killed an elected official?
Who elected him?
You don' t know what you' ve done to yourself.
I know your works.
You' re neither cold nor hot.
So because you are luke warm...?... I will spew you out of my mouth.
You can build your filthy world without me.
I took the father, now I' il take the son. me
You tell young Vallon, I' m going to paint...... Paradise square with his blood.
Two coats!
I' il festoon my sleeping chamber with his guts.
As for you Mr. Tammany fucking hall...... you come down to the Points once more...... and you' il be dispatched by my own hand!
Now get back to your celebration...... and let me eat in peace.
I paid you fair.
Down!
Raise!
You son of a bitch!
Challenge.
Challenge accepted.
And then it came...... the first day of the draft.
Thomas O' Neill.
Andrew Lewis.
Joseph Flynn
They read out the draftees names as if they were dead already.
J. B. Gleeson.
The O' Conell Guard.
The Plug Uglies.
As for us.
The Forty Thieves.
The tribes were gathered.
The Chichesters.
The drums were beating.
The Dead Rabbits.
The American guard.
The Atlantic Guard.
The Slaughterhouses.
The Bowery Boys.
Confederation of American Natives.
James Mooney.
But all we could see...... was the hand in front of us.
Shaun O' Connell.
C. W. Morris.
When?
Whenever you like.
Daybreak tomorrow.
Ground?
Paradise square.
Weapons?
That I leave up to you.
Bricks, bats, axes, knives.
Pistols?
No pistols.
Good boy.
Terms are resolved.
Counsel is concluded.
To hell with your damned draft.
Get' m boys.
Rip' m apart.
Kill the rich bastards.
Hotel!
They' re not getting my son!
Uptown town at the draft office...... the cops broke a few skulls.
And everybody ran away.
But the word was spreading...... in the dark.
Up on fifth avenue, the Schermerhorns and their mob...... breathed a little easy.
Just a brief blist of anger, over Mr. Lincoln' s draft.
Entirely justifiable in my view.
There are two sides to that question.
Ther are several sides to that question, Mr. Schermerhorn.
But only one right side.
As with any question, it holds the abuse...... of any executive power.
In any case, Mr. Greely...... we can all be thankful, it wasn' t any worse.
It may be worse yet, sir.
I don' t know what to think...
What is it you are so fond of saying, Mr. Tweed?
Mr. Greely, you won' t like this...... but what is it?
I don' t remember.
You can always hire one half of the poor...... to kill the other half.
I' ve come to say goodbye.
I' ve booked passage for California. see
Jenny, give me one more day and I' il go with you.
You' il be dead by then.
What would you have me do?
I don' t know.
This will all be finished tomorrow.
No it won' t.
This whole place is going to burn anyway.
I' ve heard of the poor are going from door to door...... in the Five Points, asking those supporters for further riots...... to place a candle in the window.
Irish, Poles, Germans.
Ah, Mr. Greely, the city is not mad...... I prophesise a dark night.
Nobody goes to work today.
We' re shutting the factories down!
When the sun rose next...... the city had split in half.
From all over New York they came...... ironworkers, factory boys, street cleaners!
Irish, Polish, German...... anyone who never cared about slavery in the Union.
Anyone who couldn' t buy his way out.
Let the sons of the rich....... go and die they cried.
Let the sons of the poor...... stay home.
The earth was shaking now.
But I was about my father' s business.
Oh, mighty Lord...... you are the dagger in my hand.
Guide my hand on this day of vengeance.
We give thanks to the Lord....... for He is good.
With you, the swift cannot flee.
Nor the strong escape.
Let my sword devour, till its thirst is quenched with blood....... and my enemy sleeps forever.
For you and the God of retribution.
For the Lord crushes the wicked.
The Lord is merciful.
And his love endures forever.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Get the women upstairs!,..

The mob have just broken open a gun store...... on 3rd avenue and are arming.
Marshall' s office on 3rd avenue is burning down.
The police is of no avail.
Show yourself, please!
Two coloured men brought in almost dead.
There are 50 more outside.
They need help.
The blacks are being attacked all over the city.
There' s the 300 dollar man!
Get him!
Did your daddy buy you out of the army!
Can he buy me out of the army too?
There is danger of mob attacking armoury...... corner 21st street, 2nd avenue.
There' s about 500 stand of arms in it.
The line is dead.
They' re trying to cut all the wires!
Riot at Pier 4, North River.

A crowd is here and are going to destroy the station.
Get her bag!
Get her bag!
From 18th precinct.
The mob have attacked the armoury.... on 2nd avenue an 21st street.
There is danger of fire in the building.
All 300 police wounded or unaccounted for.

Shang! Hold on!
Thank God.
I die a true American.
Tomorrow morning...... get our people down to the docks.
I want every man and woman coming off the boats...... given hot soup and bread..
We' re burying a lot of votes here tonight.
In the end...... they put candles on the bodies...... so their friends, if they had any....... could know them in the dark.
The city did this free of charge.
Shang, Jimmy Spoils, Hellcat.
McGloin and more.
Friend or foe...... it didn' t make no difference now.
It was four days and nights..... before the worst of the mob was finally put down.
We never knew how many New Yorkers died...... that week, before the city was finally delivered.
My father told me we was all born of blood and tribulation.
And so then too, was our great city.
But for those of us who...... lived and died in them furious days...... it was like everything we knew...... was mildly swept away.
And no matter what they did to build this city up again...... for the rest of time...... would be like no one ever knew we were here.
In St. Petersburg, Florida, this 52- year- old man
lets these two young women into the house.
They lifted up their tops, exposed themselves to the guy...
Chief Whitlock.
Chief Whitlock, it' s Ann.
Ann Merai Harrison.
Somebody just broke into my house.
All right.
Be right over, ma' am.
How you doing, Miss Harrison?
Chief.
- You okay?
- I' m fine.
Mind if I come in?
- Come in.
- Thank you.
Oh, boy.
Did you get a good look at this fellow?
Yeah.
He was about your height.
Your weight.
Come to think of it, he kind of looked like you.
Looked like me?
So he was good- looking?
No.
Sorry.
Just not my type.
So this "ugly" man... you know how he got in the house?
The bedroom window.
It' s all right if I come in your bedroom?
Yeah.
Come in.
Why don' t you tell me what happened?
Okay.
I was asleep.
But then I woke up 'cause I felt something.
I saw the windowwas open...... and he was standing right where you are.
Right here?
You sure?
All right, so what did he do?
He came toward me.
He came toward you?
Like this?
Then he grabbed me.
- Where?
- Right here.
Like that?
But he was much stronger than you.
Like that?
He forced himself on top of me.
Like that?
His breath smelled like he' d been drinking on the job, like yours.
- Really?
What happened next?
- He kissed me.
Where?
Where, baby?
And he stripped me naked.
I was confused.
He ripped my shirt off.
You didn' t put up much of a fight, did you?
Oh, really?
I didn' t put up much of a fight?
So you took control?
What did you do, baby?
Watch me.
Tell me what you did next, baby.
Chief, you' ve got to get down to the Scuttlebutt.
We' ve got a situation here.
It' s about to blow.
Chief?
- Yeah, T ony, what' s up?
- Where are you, Chief?
Can you get here?
We need you to come quick.
- Chief?
- Okay.
Look, T ony, I' m...... coming now.
- No.
- I' ve got to go, baby.
I' ve got to go.
I' ve got to go to work.
So we' il pick up on this crime tomorrow?
- Okay.
- What kind of crime?
- Assault with a deadly weapon.
- Breaking and entering.
See you later, baby.
- How y' all doing?
- Good, Chief.
Morning.
- Mathias Lee Whitlock.
- How you doing, Chris?
Having breakfast with all your friends here?
I would invite you, Chris, but I don' t want to.
I' d sit down, but I don' t want to.
- Did they find us a table?
- Yeah, we' re in the back.
- Matt.
- How you doing, Ann?
I' m starving.
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.
Hey, Chris, try the crab.
It' s real good.
- I' m allergic.
- I know.
Right.
- How you doing, Sharlene?
- Hey, Chief.
- What time is it?
- It' s 3: 00.
Let' s go.
Hey, man, you' re out of paper towels again.
- How you doing, Chae?
- Good.
Thought the camera only added ten pounds.
- Looks good, doesn' t it?
- Kind of, in a pudgy way.
I thought this might be an opportune time to revisit my offer to invest in that business venture.
- Costa Rica?
- Chartered fishing boat.
- Steal the evidence money?
- You file a report on that yet?
- Is that it?
- That' s it.
- 485 grand.
Can I touch it?
- No, you can' t.
- I just want to touch it.
- Get your hands out of there.
- Maybe I' il just steal it.
- Maybe I' il just shoot you.
Stop thinking like a cop.
Just listen to my proposition.
We' il take a grand out.
We' il go to the boat show.
We' il just walk around with the money in our pocket, get a sense of what it feels like to knowwe could buy a boat.
- I' il see you in a minute.
- What do you think?
- Chae.
- Stranger.
- How you doing?
- How you doing, Alex?
I need your keys.
I' m fine, thanks for asking.
How about you?
Listen, I need your keys.
I left a couple of things.
- Okay.
I' il go with you.
- No.
Why not?
I just want to go with you.
I don' t want to get into anything.
I got a lot of work to do today.
- I know your work is important.
- Are you going to start with that?
I' m gonna go in the other room and pretend to make a phone call.
- Congrats on making detective.
- Thanks, Chae.
Forget it.
Even if I left the Hope Diamond in there, it' s just not worth it.
- Bye, Matt.
- Good- bye, Alex.
Would you just give me the goddamn keys?
They' re on the desk right in front of you.
I' il drop them off.
- See you.
- See you, sweetie.
She looks good.
Sometimes I think you want me to shoot you.
Wait.
Hold that thought.
Medical examiner.
Yeah.
What kind of prick dies at cocktail hour on a Friday?
The nerve of some people.
- Have a good one.
- Yeah, see you.
Catch anything?
Trying to catch my self- respect.
Figuring out what it is I' m doing in the middle of this... threesome.
Try foursome.
You' re forgetting your wife.
She left me.
I told her the other day... told her today... come get her stuff.
How' s the pro football quarterback?
He' s up north hunting for the weekend.
The whole weekend.
I got a splinter in my butt.
You okay?
I' m okay.
I' m definitely okay.
It' s all right.
- You still love her.
- Huh?
You still love her, don' t you?
Yeah, I do.
Yeah, you do.
Will you divorce her?
- You still got your ring on.
- Chris needs me.
- Oh, okay.
- He does.
He' s lost, been that way since he got cut from the team.
I guess I feel sorry for him.
Remember that the next time he goes upside your head.
Okay.
Sure.
All right.
I' il be right there.
- Ann Merai.
- Dr. Frieland.
- This is my brother Matt.
- Nice to meet you.
Sorry to bring you in today.
I was in surgery all day yesterday.
Please.
You can talk in front of him.
It' s fine.
Right.
Ann, I' m afraid there' s been a bit of a setback.
I had your tests back yesterday.
The cancer is not in remission.
It' s come back very aggressively.
It' s attacked your liver and lungs.
How long?
Well, that' s difficult to say.
How long?
Five, six months.
No one can say for sure.
But I feel fine.
Listen... there' s a counselor here at the hospital I' d like you to see.
She' s very good.
She' il help you during this period.
Thank you for coming in on your day off.
Ann, wait.
Excuse me.
Maybe you could speak to her about the counseling?
Listen, you should be able to do something, right?
What about that experimental stuff?
You know, like "60 Minutes"?
I don' t know.
There are alternative approaches.
- Yeah?
- Sure.
Let' s see.
Autologous cancer vaccines, hematology procedures, hyperthermia treatments.
Here.
Take a look at those.
They' re extremely expensive, and there are no guarantees.
- Okay.
You all right?
Yeah.
Why didn' t you tell me, baby?
I' m sorry.
I forgot about it.
For a couple hours, I didn' t think about dying.
I understand.
You know, they' ve got this alternative stuff.
There' s a clinic in Switzerland...
I know.
I don' t put much stock in all that stuff.
They said there' s a 17% chance, a 17% success rate.
A whole 17%?
Odds are better I' d hit the lottery, which is what I' d have to do to afford something like that.
Listen.
Where are you going?
I don' t think we should do this anymore.
It wasn' t right for me to drag you into this.
You didn' t drag me into anything.
I' m a big boy.
Matt, I' m dying.
I' m dying.
- Thanks for the flowers.
- You' re welcome.
The girls at work were so jealous.
Glad to hear that.
That' s not why you called me.
- What' s up?
- I want to show you something.
- Chris didn' t hit you again?
- No.
When we were married, we took out insurance policies on each other, but they were only for $100, 000.
This says $1 million.
Did you know about this?
No.
I remember signing things, but I didn' t know he' d made changes.
He can' t get away with this.
This is fraud.
You were sick.
No.
I was diagnosed six months ago.
Chris increased the policy almost a year ago, right after my 32nd birthday.
My mother was 33 when she died of cancer.
Oh, no.
- That Chris?
- He' s here.
- Maybe he can explain this.
- No.
- Why not?
Now' s the time.
- This is not the time.
- When is the time?
- I don' t know.
Please.
I' m sorry, baby.
I' m just taking the trash out.
Thought you were working a double tonight.
Bet you did.
Howwas your appointment on Saturday?
- Appointment?
- Yeah, with Dr. Frieland.
I didn' t have an appointment.
- No?
You sure?
- I' m sure.
'Cause Jay saw you go inside his office.
You were going inside with some other guy.
No, I just stopped by.
I had to ask some questions.
Now you were there.
I was there, but I had to ask him some questions.
Here we go with the lies again.
- I' m not lying to you.
- Yes, you are!
Start telling me the truth!
- You' re hurting me!
- Why do you make me do this?
I' m not making you do anything!
It ain' t my goddamn fault!
It ain' t my fault!
Chris, how you doing, football player?
Good, Mathias.
How you doing?
I' m good.
Judy Anderson called, said she saw a prowler in the neighborhood.
You see anything?
What about your wife?
She home?
She didn' t see anything.
- You didn' t ask her.
- She didn' t say anything about it.
Maybe I should ask her, not that I don' t trust your mind- reading.
- Hey, Ann, how you doing?
- I didn' t see anything.
- I' m going to check the perimeter.
- Go ahead.
You see somebody, you holler.
You have a good night.
- We did it.
- This wasn' t necessary.
My name shouldn' t be on your house.
I' il buy my own in a few years.
- Chief Whitlock.
- Hey, baby, it' s me.
What time do you get off?
I' ve found a way to go to that clinic.
- Right.
- Can you talk?
- Hold on.
- Forget it.
Excuse me.
I' m sorry.
You know, I' ve got to go.
T ell her I say hi.
Is this a bad time?
Can you talk?
Yeah.
It' s no problem.
You' ve got to hear this.
It' s incredible.
I name you the beneficiary of my life insurance policy.
Not me personally.
You name The Living Gift as your beneficiary after we purchase the policy from you.
I mean, The Living Gift... collects on the policy when I die.
As the beneficiary, yes, we collect on the policy.
So you make a profit if she dies?
Is that legal?
- We wouldn' t be here if it wasn' t.
- How much do I get?
The amount depends on how long your medical staff says I have to live.
How about a ballpark figure? - $750, 000.
- I know.
Even if they have to repeat the treatment several times, there would be enough money for us to go somewhere.
Like the Conch Festival in Key West?
No.
Clambake in Opa Locka?
No!
Europe.
- Europe?
Or Africa.
I' m going to beat this.
You watch.
Richard Petty, give me a hand.
Hey, man, watch it.
Watch that blood.
Come on, Ann, talk to me.
Their investors won' t let them buy any new policies.
The Living Gift?
We can go somewhere else.
We' il get somebody else to buy it.
I can' t.
There' s only two days left to change it.
What do you mean?
A provision says the beneficiary can' t be changed after a year, and that' s in two days.
Well, maybe we could call down...
It' s too late!
- Don' t, don' t.
Don' t.
This is not fixable.
Just go.
Just go.
What did Alex pick up from your place the other day?
I don' t know.
Well, over for sure now, huh?
She left something so she' d have a chance to come see you.
See if she still had feelings.
Based on what I saw, she didn' t have any feelings... except anger.
Think you' ve had enough.
I' m trying to help you here.
One of your patrons has been overserved.
I may have to cite you on that, Helena.
See you tomorrow, Chae.
See you tomorrow.
Bustin 'my chops, Mr. Drinking- On- Duty.
I' il see you later.
- Good night.
- Take it easy.
Let me get you a refill, Chief.
No, I' m good, Chris.
It ain' t a bribe, just a beer.
Two, whatever he was just drinking.
Thank you.
Let me ask you something.
That night you were out there looking for that prowler, did you see anybody?
No, I didn' t.
I had this feeling when I got home that Ann was with some other guy.
Really?
I think he snuck out the back when I got home.
No, I didn' t see anybody.
Next time that little pussy comes around...
Little pussy?
The guy scurries out the back door the second he hears my voice.
- "Scurries"?
- Yeah.
I could almost respect a man who had the balls to confront me, tell me, "Yeah, I' m banging your wife."
Maybe this guy, maybe there' s nothing he would rather do than to tell you that you' re a lousy husband and don' t deserve Ann.
Maybe there' s nothing he would rather do than to walk up to your face, look you in the eye, and say to you, "Chris, I' m banging your wife... good."
You know, maybe... your wife won' t let him.
I' d respect him at least.
look him in his eye, and I' d say,
"Just come near her again...... and I' il kill you."
I can' t let you go around threatening people' s lives.
If you' re serious, I would be obligated to do something.
Really?
That' s right.
Thanks for the beer... and the conversation.
- Thanks for listening.
- You give Ann my best, if you can.
You been waiting long?
Sorry about last night.
You must really be mad at me.
God, I used to love coming out here with you.
I thought I was the shit, being a freshman making out with a senior.
You were.
- Still are.
- I guess I was.
- Here.
- What' s this?
My going- away present.
- Going away?
- Insurance policy.
You' re making me the beneficiary?
Buy that fishing boat you and Chae have always talked about.
Right.
- Here.
- No.
I' m leaving tomorrow.
What?
I' m leaving town tomorrow.
I' ve got to get out of here.
I need to get away from Chris.
I need some peace.
- Chief Whitlock.
- How can I help you?
You just did, buddy.
- How you doing?
- Good.
Take this.
Meet me at my house.
What is it?
It' s a gift to you.
- Switzerland.
- What?
- It' s money.
- What money?
That drug money?
Oh, my God.
What if they want it back?
By law, the money has to stay in the custody of the arresting department until the appeals process is over.
With the money Scarcetti has, it could take years.
But Tony and the guys...
They think I' m putting it in a safe deposit box.
What time does Chris get home?
11: 30.
Go to your house, pack a bag, meet me at my house, 11: 00.
You okay?
See you later.
What are you doing here?
Barbara' s pissed off about something.
Got to wait her out.
Listen.
You see anybody come in here?
- No.
- You sure?
Okay.
Why don' t you head over to the Scuttlebutt?
They cut me off, no thanks to you.
Tell them Chief Whitlock said everything' s okay.
That' s the first place Barbara' s going to look!
- She won' t look there.
- She will!
I' ve got half a pack of cigarettes in there!
Tell Engine Two to lay it out and start attacking it from the back!
Go, go!
Pull it up!
Let' s get moving!
1919 on 415 San Juan.
That' s about four miles outside of town.
Go!
Let' s keep moving!
Aim the hose right there!
Mathias, you all right?
I know it' s hard to take.
I' il grab you a cup of coffee.
- Was it an accident?
- I don' t know.
Maybe.
These propane tanks just don' t blow for no reason.
Man, this place was an inferno.
Those poor folks didn' t have a chance.
Hi, Chief.
Chief.
What are you doing here?
I' m a homicide detective, and there' s two dead bodies.
- So what happened?
- They think the propane tank blew.
You knowwho they are?
- I think it' s definitely "were."
- Right, Chae.
Hey, Mathias, check it out.
Definitely arson.
Definitely.
The closer I stay to the scene, the better.
Yeah, it' s possibly a double homicide.
We' re gonna have to take this thing over.
Chief, Judy Anderson' s mom is visiting from Orlando.
Last night, Judy said her mom saw somebody sneaking around.
I checked it out, didn' t see anything.
We should probably tell Alex.
I' il tell her.
You get back to the office.
They want me to run my investigation out of your place for the next 24.
I need your help... background on the vics, people they knew.
- A tour guide?
- You cool with that?
- Okay.
No problem.
- Are you sure?
No problem at all.
Why don' t we ride back and you fill me in on the Harrisons?
My boys will set up at your place.
- Okay.
- Great.
I just wanted to say I' m really sorry about the timing.
What do you mean?
With the papers, and then this today.
The divorce papers?
- I should have called you before.
- That would have been nice.
I know.
But it has been eight months.
Don' t you think we need closure?
I really don' t want to talk about it.
Thanks for opening up.
Let' s talk about the Harrisons.
Either of them screwing around?
I don' t know.
Is anybody happily married these days?
These have already been gone through.
Right.
He was supposed to get off at 11: 30.
Right.
Mr. Harrison.
So you don' t know if Mr. Harrison came to work or not.
Hold on.
Did you know she worked as a dental hygienist for a Dr. Shider?
Really?
No.
I' m going to pay him a visit.
You want to come?
Okay.
Thanks.
So she quit yesterday?
Well, kind of.
Ann Merai had terminal cancer.
Really?
I think she was trying to keep it quiet.
- Anything else you could tell us?
- I think she was having an affair.
Did she actually tell you she was having an affair?
We don' t really talk a lot, mainly what' s happening on our stories.
But I just got the feeling.
Sometimes when she' d be on the phone, she would talk real quiet.
Whisper?
Did you ever see him, or did she tell you who he was?
No.
But he was classy.
About a week ago, she got flowers from Rosie' s.
Really nice.
It was beautiful.
Remember, Bruce?
But I met her husband once, and he just doesn' t seem like the type to send flowers.
Rosie!
Chief Whitlock.
Listen, we' re trying to find out if some flowers were sent to an Ann Merai Harrison last week, sent to her office.
Harrison.
Check and see if one of your guys sent them.
- What hospital?
- Mercy Med.
- Chris Harrison.
- Her husband.
Okay.
Thanks a lot, Rosie.
Yeah.
No, that' s all.
Thank you, Rosie.
If you' d like to make a call...
You ready?
I guess so.
Okay.
All right.
Thank you for your help.
- Sure.
- Thank you.
If you think of anything else, here' s my card.
Thanks a lot.
Please don' t do me like that.
You knew I wasn' t finished.
I' m sorry.
Dr. Shider gave me the name of Ann Merai' s doctor.
I want to find out more about her cancer.
You can drop me off back at the station.
You really don' t like being around me, do you?
No.
I just, you know...
There isn' t any reason for both of us to be wasting time at the doctor' s office.
What' s so pressing that you have to do?
I do have a job.
I am Chief of Police.
Yeah, of a four- person department, Matt.
That' s the problem between the two of us.
You think your job is more important than my job.
- Never said that.
- Yeah, you did.
You never say it directly, but in indirect ways you say it.
You wanted to leave Banyan Key so we could be closer to your important job.
You never said the commute was taking time away from us?
- I didn' t have a problem with that.
- You didn' t?
- So I' m hearing things now?
- Whatever.
Is that the reason you' re not coming?
Is that your date paging you?
One of my four officers checked in.
It' s a tracking device.
And you can tell on that?
That' s what it tells me.
We' re all tied into it.
The mayor' s brother sells them, so we spent half the budget on them.
See, if we were moving, you' d see it tracking.
Sorry.
If we were moving right now, it would show us tracking.
Great.
Why don' t we drive to the doctor' s office, and I can see how it works?
I' m going to the bathroom.
I' il meet you in there.
- Hi.
- May I help you?
Yeah.
Dr. Donovan' s office.
- Her office is on the third floor.
- Thank you, Ramona.
Ann Harrison didn' t have cancer.
Are you sure?
Not counting the time she spent in Atlanta,
Ann Merai has been my patient since junior high.
If she had cancer, I would have known about it.
I don' t get it.
Maybe she saw another doctor.
She was here for her yearly when she first got back to town two months ago, and she was healthy as a proverbial horse.
I' m looking it over here, and...
I don' t understand.
Who told you she had cancer?
Excuse me.
So...
Can I help you?
Yeah, I' m looking for Dr. Frieland.
You' re looking at him.
You' re Dr. Frieland?
Yes, I am.
- Hold on, Pop.
- You' re sure?
This is your office?
It has been for ten years, yes.
Look, I' il get back to you.
Do you have a patient named Ann Merai Harrison?
I really can' t tell you that.
You can tell me.
Was she your patient or not?
Was she your patient or not?
Was she your patient or not?
No, I' ve never had a patient by that name.
- You sure?
- Yes, I' m sure, very sure.
Yeah, I would know that.
Okay, I' m sorry.
That your pen?
- Pen?
Yes.
- Do you use it much?
No, not very much.
You don' t mind if I take it, do you?
No, you can have the pen.
It' s yours.
Take it.
It' s yours.
Right.
Right.
I know that part.
Hang on one sec.
Did you get a checkup or something?
No.
Just bad coffee.
All right.
No, just tell them they' ve got to stop lagging.
We need those phone records now.
All right.
Thanks.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
We all good?
Fantastic.
How' s this, ma' am?
You fixed his nose already?
Just wonderful.
Hey, Chief.
How you doing, Judy?
I' m fine, thanks, considering...
Alex, we' ve got an eyewitness here.
Mr. Anderson, this is Detective Diaz- Whitlock.
Well, just...
We' re on top of it.
I told them how Judy' s mom saw somebody sneaking around the Harrison place last night.
Got them right over there sketching it out for us.... the guy she saw outside her window...
That' s her right there?
- Good job.
- Chief, check this out.
Sketch of a prowler out to the Harrisons' last night.
Look.
Ring any bells?
Hi, Tony.
No.
I mean, no.
He looked like him.
- Like who?
- Like him.
- Like me?
- Yeah.
You.
Mom, he' s the Chief of Police.
- So he was black, ma' am?
- Yeah, he was black.
Wait a minute.
Maybe him.
Mrs. Anderson, thank you.
Thank you very, very much.
Anyway...
I' m so sorry.
Mother was raised in a different time.
Don' t worry about it.
We' re on top of it, okay?
- I need to talk to you.
- I appreciate you coming down.
I am so embarrassed.
Please, you' ve got to stop.
I want you to take this up to Miami for me, okay?
I want you to give it to a Detective Gissen.
- Gissen?
- Gissen, right.
I' m going to give you his number.
I need prints on that ASAP.
- Is it for this thing?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
An Agent Stark from the DEA is on line one for you.
Who?
Agent Stark.
Said it' s about the Scarcetti case.
Thank you.
Chief Whitlock.
Agent Stark, DEA.
How you doing?
- Busy.
- You and me both, pal.
I understand you guys are holding evidence in the Scarcetti case.
Great.
That makes you my new best friend.
I' m going to send some agents this aftemoon to pick up that cash.
We think it was used last year in a sting operation with Paolo Estaban.
If we can tie the serial numbers to the bills you guys have, we can tie Estaban to Scarcetti.
This is a top priority for us, Chief.
With this evidence, we can kill two birds with one stone, nail Estaban and Scarcetti.
Why don' t I call you tomorrow, and we figure out a time...
This had to be done the day before yesterday.
We' ve got a court date next week.
The evidence has to stay with me until the appeals process is over.
I didn' t call you to get a lecture on the rules of evidence.
We need to check the serial numbers, and that' s what we' re going to do.
I want you to type up a chain of evidence receipt.
One of my men will be happy to sign it for you this aftemoon.
- Oh, yeah, and, Chief...
- Yeah?
It' s been ten seconds.
Chief, you okay?
Fine.
Just tell Gissen that I need those prints really quick.
I' m sure Alex can...
We don' t want to give them to Alex.
- Sorry.
I just thought...
- Just do it!
Okay.
I' m sorry.
I' m very sorry.
Just go there, stay there, and call me as soon as they' re done.
You got it.
No, I' ve been on hold.
When should I call back?
Thanks.
Here you go.
Baste, my phone records!
How long can it take to fax over a few sheets of paper?
I' il call them again.
- Alex, I think we got something here.
- What?
Look at this entry into the checkbook, that last one.
- Is this the only entry you found?
- So far, but it' s a new register.
What' s going on?
They got a life insurance policy, and we' ve got a potential murder.
Shit, there' s got to be tons of these life insurance companies, right?
Right.
- You got any pull at the bank?
- Sure.
- You want me to get an address?
- Please.
Sharlene, you know that report I gave you?
They' re not going to be able to run them for another half an hour.
Call me when you' ve got something.
- T.
- Shit.
You should see the rack on this chick that just walked by.
- Just call me.
- Oh, my God.
- Those my phone records?
- No, just a fax for me.
Baste, what' s up with my fax?
It' s not here.
- She said she sent them.
- Who' s she?
- Miss White.
- Who' s Miss White?
She' s a supervisor over there.
I' ve dealt with her before.
Call Miss White back.
They' re not here.
I talked to her a couple of minutes ago.
Well, she assured me that she sent them.
We need to call her back and actually have her wait as we see the fax coming through.
Be happy to.
Miss White?
This is Detective Baste with Miami- Dade.
Yeah, I just spoke to you about the Harrison phone records.
I haven' t received them yet.
What do you mean you sent them?
I' m staring at the fax machine, and it' s not there.
I' m going to stand right in front of it.
I' m going to your superiors.
Do I need to be more clear than that?
Can I use your computer for a sec?
Couple of minutes.
He just e- mailed me a bunch of warrants I need to look up.
- 60 seconds.
- I' m not raising my voice!
You got writer' s block.
No, just working on my report.
On what?
On somebody jaywalking?
Yeah, someone was jaywalking, or urinating on the sidewalk, or throwing spitballs at a crossing guard.
It' s a small office, but it' s my office.
Phone records coming in.
- Is this it?
- It says "receiving."
Oh, shit.
It' s out of paper.
You' re kidding me.
Oh, God.
Could we get some paper, Sharlene?
Anybody got any paper?
Paper, folks!
Don' t all move at once.
Anybody in Banyan Key have paper?
It' s about 81/ 2 by 11 inches...
Here you go.
What do you do?
"Start"?
Here it comes.
We' ve got a little problem with this machine.
It' s fine, fine.
Great.
Thank you.
Let me just get over here.
I hate this thing.
Here.
There we go.
"Start."
There we go.
- I can' t read this.
- It' s the toner.
- Have her re- fax it.
- It' s okay.
- I can read it.
It' s okay.
- No, fax it again.
That says Barry Thomas.
A friend of Chris' from high school.
I know him.
- That one is Will Blount.
- You guys okay?
It' s okay.
This one is Frank Rhodes.
No.
All the boxes go to Miami.
So the last call they made was to American Airlines at 8 p. m.
Hey.
Got a surprise for you.
Both of them already dead when somebody turned them into s' mores.
- What?
- Both of them?
No sign of smoke in their lungs.
If they' d been alive when that place went up, their lungs would look like mine.
Alex, here are the cell phone records.
Cell phone?
They' re on a different database than the land lines.
"Town of Banyan Key."
"12: 34 a. m."
305- 555- 0199?
What time did grandma say she saw that prowler?
After "Leno."
What time' s "Leno" over?
Like 12: 00, 12: 30?
Hello?
This might be our guy.
How many phone calls do you get after midnight?
Must be a bad connection.
All right.
555- 0199.
Come on, come on.
Let me see if I can find the number for you.
I don' t knowwho it is.
The Nextel subscriber you are trying to reach is outside the service area.
Please try again later.
No, I don' t have it.
Whoever it is works for the town of Banyan Key.
How do we find out whose phone this is?
- All right, I' il...
- Just ask.
Is there anybody even in Banyan Key?
Yeah, I' il talk to you later.
Hey, Alex?
I' m sorry, I was drifting off there.
What' d you say that number was?
555- 0199.
0199?
You' re sure it' s not 1099?
Chae, 0199.
0199?
That' s weird.
That' s my cell phone number.
Yours?
- Yeah.
- Aren' t you County?
I work part- time as a paramedic... football games, school stuff.
And you called him last night?
I don' t know.
Did I...?
Oh, Jesus, I did call him last night.
I called him from the bar.
I wanted to see if he wanted to have a couple of drinks.
- You' re friends with him?
- I wouldn' t say that.
He' s, like, my bottom- of- the- list guy when you' ve got to have somebody to drink with.
I would have mentioned it.
I totally forgot.
You should have told me this at the scene, Chae.
I don' t remember too much about last night.
I was in no good shape.
Check with the bartender...
I closed the place, staggered home, passed out next to my wife.
I didn' t move until I got the call to show up at the scene.
I need a statement.
I' il give you a statement right now.
What' s the matter with you?
You' re like a love child of Barney Fife and Joe Friday.
All right, a statement.
- What was that about?
- I was sleeping with her.
Jesus.
So you didn' t...
No, but it was all a plan, them coming back here.
They set me up, planned the whole thing.
What plan?
What do you mean?
I gave her the Scarcetti money.
God!
Would you have given it to me if I slept with you?
- Any trace of the money?
- None.
I thought I had trouble with women.
Maybe you should just tell her.
- Who, Alex?
Tell Alex.
Are you out of your mind?
Look what they' ve got on me.
Ann Merai names me beneficiary on her insurance policy, and I was having an affair with her.
Opportunity... an eyewitness saw me outside their house the night it blew up.
You want to hear some more?
Alibi.
Home, by myself.
That good?
At least you changed your cell phone number.
Even if Alex wanted to believe me, there' s so much evidence against me, she' d have to turn me in.
You' re right.
That' d kill any chance of getting back together.
What?
She says, "Let' s call the divorce off."
What are you talking about?
I' m looking at murder charges.
I don' t know what you were thinking.
Forget it.
Can I do anything?
You don' t think obstruction of justice is enough?
I' m on a roll.
Chief Whitlock.
The guy' s name is Paul Cabot.
He' s done time before.
They got his prints from a criminal database.
You got an address?
Yeah.
36 ReefRoad, in Kendall.
All right, come on.
Hurry up.
- You want a beer?
- Nah, I' m okay.
What tangled webs we weave...
What you got?
Your doctor worked at the hospital, but seems he was in my line of work.
Son of a gun.
Let' s get out of here.
- Let me get the beer.
- Come on, let' s go.
I' ve got to get the beer.
A beer in the hand is worth two in the fridge.
What are you doing?
Down by a lot of runs.
I got about ten grand in the bank.
Get you down to Costa Rica.
You can scout out boats for us.
You think I' m done?
I appreciate the offer, but I' m not running.
The idea was I drive you.
Drive me back to the station.
- All right.
- All right.
Got your insurance company on the line.
That policy number corresponds to a $1 million term life insurance policy for an Ann Merai Harrison.
Any messages there for me?
- Who' s the beneficiary?
- Just a moment here.
Looks like the beneficiary is listed as...
... Chris Harrison, her husband.
Thank you.
You' ve been really helpful.
I' m sorry I couldn' t be more...
Wait a minute.
I got a note here.
The policy holder requested a form to change the beneficiary last week.
So she changed it?
If she did, it hasn' t made it in the system yet.
So what does that mean?
Is that in the mail, or...
It could be downstairs in our processing center.
Waiting to be processed.
Can you connect me?
I think they' re still out to lunch.
All right, so call back in half an hour?
Sure, why not?
Thank you.
This is Bill.
- How you doing?
What have you been up to?
Let me ask you a favor.
I' ve got a Capital One credit card statement on a Paul Cabot.
I need you to find out the last place he used his card.
I got something for you.
- C- A- B- O- T?
- Yeah.
- Can you hold?
No problem.
I found this under the seat of one of the Harrison' s cars.
It' s a bank card receipt to a gas station used by a guy named Paul Cabot.
Nice.
Check the phone records.
- Already on it.
- Paul Cabot.
Anybody know or ever heard of a Paul Cabot?
Come on, people, wake up.
No?
No.
Paul Cabot?
Frank, call the bank, see what they' ve got.
No records of any incoming or outgoing calls to a Paul Cabot.
Check every restaurant, gas station...
- Yeah?
- I' ve got something.
If this guy took a piss and paid for it, I want to know.
He' s got a reservation at the Costa Coral Hotel.
- There' s a hold on it now?
- Checked in yesterday.
- Costa Coral Hotel.
- You know where it is?
On Atlantic Avenue.
- Yeah.
You' re a lifesaver.
- Chief Whitlock?
- Yeah.
Agent White.
This is Agent Fetzer.
We' re here to pick up the Scarcetti money.
Agent Stark said to send the money to his office.
My guy left five minutes ago.
- He told you we' d pick it up.
- He said send it to his office.
He told you to send the money to the office?
He' il tell you.
- Let me talk to him.
- He wants to talk to you.
What the hell is your problem?
I told you to get that money ready,
- that I was sending agents...
- You said...
What are you, a parrot, telling me what I said?
I know what I said.
No, I' m not a parrot.
I know what you said.
Then where the hell is the money?
If you shut up for five minutes, I can tell you where the money is.
I sent the money to your office.
My guy just left.
He should be up there in about an hour.
If you have a problem with that after I hang up in ten seconds, call your partners at the IRS, tell them to audit me.
- You little bastard!
- Agent Stark.
What?
What?
- I meant five seconds.
- Damn it, Chief!
Sorry, I can' t hear you.
You' re breaking up.
Can you hear me?
Sorry about your phone.
Can you hear me now?
Costa Coral Hotel.
Good aftemoon.
I just checked in to your hotel.
I' m trying to access my voice mail.
- You' re not in your room.
- I' m on my cell phone.
Okay, that' s no problem.
- Can you help me?
- Sure.
What' s your room number?
I don' t remember.
I just checked in.
- What' s your name?
- Paul Cabot.
Please hold.
- You' re in room 715.
- 715.
Okay, thank you.
To access your voice mail...
Alex, we got a Paul Cabot at a Costa Coral Hotel in Miami.
It' s on Atlantic.
- He' s supposed to be here already.
- These people work slow.
- Did you get those things?
You got a TV?
Watch pay- per- view.
Forget pay- per- view.
You got your wife under control?
Is she cool?
She' s not gonna...
She' s not talking to nobody.
She' s not going nowhere.
She' s got too much to lose.
All right.
Damn, man.
You take a terrible picture.
Get yourself over here.
We' ve gotta get out of town.
Right.
Excuse me.
How you doing?
I left my key up in my room.
A knucklehead.
715.
It' s Cabot.
Paul Cabot, 715.
Happens all the time, Mr. Cabot.
Thank you.
Paul?
Paul Cabot, it' s the police.
403, request for driver' s license info...
- There' s somebody up there!
- What?
There' s somebody up there!
Oh, my God!
Where?
See you, Mr. Cabot.
Do you have a Paul Cabot registered here?
Yeah.
Someone was pushed off the seventh- floor balcony!
How do you know he was pushed?
A man was seen climbing back into his room.
- Calm down, relax.
- Which side of the building was it?
That' s the guy!
That' s him!
That' s Cabot!
I' il take four.
You go upstairs.
- Stop!
- Jesus!
Mathias?
I pulled in right after you.
- Did he come down?
- Nobody came past me.
- I' il meet you in the lobby.
- In the lobby.
Get these people out of here.
I' m gonna shut down the elevators.
It' s him!
Police officer.
I' il cover the back!
- You got the money?
- Yeah, I got the money.
- Where' d you stash it?
- Right behind the seat.
Flight number 601, non- stop to San Jose.
I' m not flying to Costa Rica.
Get off the phone.
- I gotta go.
- I' il swing by your house...
- Your new girl?
- No.
Weren' t we supposed to meet in the lobby?
I just had to get my cell out of the car, make a call...... to the office, you know, checking on a lead.
- Let' s go back upstairs.
- My boys are on it.
Why don' t we go have a talk?
Sure.
You got something you want to tell me or need to tell me?
What do you mean?
Something that I ought to know, but that you might not want to say.
Congratulations on making detective.
I' m proud of you.
I never said it, but I am.
I know you are.
You don' t have to say it.
That' s not what I' m talking about.
How' d you get to the hotel so fast?
I heard it on the radio.
So, nothing else you want to say?
I' m gonna sign those divorce papers.
- I' m not talking...
- I' il get to it.
I just haven' t...
- Believe me, I' il sign 'em.
- It' s cool.
We' re in no hurry.
Are we?
I' m not.
You knowwhat this place reminds me of?
When we first started going out.
Remember when we used to talk on the phone for hours?
And you had this thing.
You' d say, "Well, I guess that' s everything."
And you' d hang up on me.
And then you' d call right back.
That' s right.
What would you say?
That I love you...... very much.
I liked that.
Come here.
Come here, you have something in your hair.
Chief...
These are from Agent Stark.
He sounded kind of pissed.
See you tomorrow, okay?
Detective, the hotel called.
The clerk' s on his way from the hospital.
Detective?
Call the insurance company, see if they found out who the beneficiary is yet.
You got it.
- City Hall.
- Hi.
Accounting, please.
Sure, let me get that number for you.
I' m sorry, they' ve gone home for the day.
- Of course they have.
Thank you.
- You' re welcome.
Alex, did Cabot make any phone calls from his hotel?
We' re waiting on them.
Okay.
Chief, the hotel called.
They left a message.
The clerk left half an hour ago.
He should be here any minute.
Great.
Whitlock.
- Matt...
Matt, I' m so sorry.
I' m so sorry.
I' m so sorry.
It was never...
This is a surprise.
There' s so much I have to tell you.
I need to...
You got a lot of people worried about you, Ann.
I know.
We all had the funny idea that you were dead.
I' m sorry, Matt.
I' m so sorry.
- I' m so sorry.
- Where' s Chris?
Oh, God, I' ve lied to you so much.
He forced me to do this.
He and his friend Paul found out about the Scarcetti thing.
They stole bodies from the morgue.
- You switched the dental records.
- I had to.
I had to.
They said they' d kill me.
See, Paul was a criminal, Matt.
- He was?
- Yes.
He was killed today.
They made me do this.
Now it looks like you and I faked my death to collect on the insurance policy.
So what do you want me to do?
I don' t want to have to face them and have to answer questions about this.
I gotta get out of town, but I don' t know where to go.
And I need money.
So where' s Chris?
You' re right.
I should have come to you earlier.
He' s there, isn' t he?
Yes.
I would have contacted you earlier, but I knew you would think it was another trick.
I don' t blame you.
He beat me up and...
- Matt?
- Yeah.
He beat me up and...
- See, Paul had the money...
- I have the money.
No, I don' t want to involve you in any more of this.
Where are you?
I' m here at the old boat.
Stay there.
I' il meet you.
I' ve interviewed her twice already, and it does match up.
- Neil, Detective Diaz- Whitlock.
- Hi.
- Ouch.
- I' m okay.
You' re up for answering a few questions?
You need anything else?
This way.
All right, take a seat to your left.
Here you go.
- Where' s Chief Whitlock?
- I don' t know.
Bathroom, maybe.
Alex, insurance company, line two.
Detective Diaz- Whitlock.
Detective, I got your beneficiary.
It' s a Mathias Lee Whitlock.
Thank you.
Agent Stark, DEA.
I' m looking for Chief Whitlock.
- How much was it?
- 485, 000.
Did he arrange to have it picked up or dropped off?
He told my agents he was sending it to my office.
Nobody showed.
I' m sure it was just miscommunication.
That' s a. 38, Chris.
Only six shots.
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun!
He' s gone.
You all right?
Give me the gun.
Wait a minute.
You said he beat you up.
It was self- defense.
No jury would convict you.
Just put the gun down.
You think Chris did this to my face?
I think you should put your gun on the floor.
What?
Put it down.
I didn' t think I could do this, but I will.
You set this up.
- Put your gun on the floor.
- Are you sure?
Don' t do this.
Where' s the money?
Come on.
Jesus!
So you...
We didn' t mean anything to each other?
- It' s not important.
- That' s not important now.
- It was just all an act?
- Where' s the money?
Look me in the eye and tell me you didn' t mean any of it.
Some of it!
Don' t try to confuse me!
- I don' t have any choice now.
- You don' t have to do this.
I' ve known you all your life.
You' re not a criminal.
- You know I know you...
- Stop!
What?!
Okay.
All right, high- school sweetheart.
You think I' m playing?
I' m not playing.
Damn!
- I was aiming for your arm.
- Well, you missed!
- Where is it?
- Outside the door.
- Show me!
- All right.
Just calm down.
Just wait a minute.
Just wait.
Don' t shoot me.
I' m just gonna reach for it.
Show me!
- Here it is.
- Put it down.
- Wait, don' t shoot me.
I' m so sorry.
I' m the one that got you the money.
I' m trying to save your life.
I can' t live broke.
Life ain' t shit when you' re broke.
- Shit!
- Wait!
Wait, no!
Oh, my God.
- Anyone else up here?
- No.
How' d you find me?
- Are you hit?
- No, I' m okay.
I' m all right.
It' s Alex.
Get me an ambulance and a med examiner.
No, I' m fine.
I' m at the end of Runyon Road on the dock.
Hurry.
Did you kill Paul Cabot?
No...
It was self- defense.
He was attacking me.
I was trying to get the money back.
You were just gonna hand the money back?
- That' s what I was trying to do.
- Then what' s that over there?
What do you got?
Chris and Ann Harrison' s bodies are upstairs.
The real ones.
They were both working for Cabot.
Chief found out they were here and took care of business, right?
Right.
- Let' s move.
- Good job.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Your guy never showed up, Whitlock.
Agent Stark?
I don' t care if you' re injured or not.
I want that evidence money, or you' re gonna be looking at a case...
Where the hell is Southeast 63rd Street in Miami?
53rd Street.
I told you 53rd Street, not 63rd.
- No, you did not.
- Yes, I did.
I said Southeast 53rd...
You said, "Those assholes in the DEA are at 8400 Southeast 63rd Street."
I didn' t.
I' m very sorry.
What I said was, "Those assholes from the DEA are at 8400 Southeast 53rd."
- 63rd.
- Never mind.
Just give them the money.
Give them the money.
You don' t have to count it.
It' s all there.
Have a safe ride home.
- Come on.
- Assholes.
- It is all there, right?
- Most of it.
It' s all there.
That' s a pretty good one.
Nice touch.
A little over the top.
- Which part?
- Your part.
You' re the one that came in here screaming.
What happened to you, man?
Just never leave your wife.
That' s what happened to me.
I' d take the bullet.
Be careful there.
It' s a classic.
That grille work comes from France.
- How you feeling?
Excuse us.
- Yes, ma' am.
Did you love her?
No.
Why would you do this, then?
Because I' m...
Because I' m stupid.
I thought I was doing the right thing, trying to help her, but it' s no excuse.
Sometimes people, you know, do stupid things.
Especially when they' re still in love.
Thank you.
Let' s go.
How you doing?
I thought you were Chae.
He called all worked up about something.
- You want to sit down?
- Yeah.
- How you doing?
- Good.
- I asked that already?
I said I was good.
- You want a beer?
- Yes.
I don' t have any left.
You can share mine, though.
So what brings you out this way?
I just needed to move the rest of my stuff.
That' s cool, I guess.
The house is a mess.
This came for you at the station.
You opened it?
You opened my mail?
- Why you always opening my mail?
- Just read it.
They just want you to fill out the forms.
"To claim amount payable to the beneficiary for the sum of $1 million."
- What?
- We' re rich.
We' re rich.
How about that? - $1 million.
- Easy, Chae.
- He can' t take that money.
- I can' t take the money?
- Why not?
- It' s a conflict of interest.
- He' s the legal beneficiary.
- I am the legal beneficiary.
And he' s one of the arresting officers.
What the hell' s that got to do with anything?
Tell him how much trouble you can get in.
It' s a million bucks!
It' s the chance of a lifetime!
No!
As his wife, I' m telling you he' s not taking that money.
- As my wife?
- As your wife.
Come on.
Come on, don' t fall for that.
- What do you mean, as my wife?
- As your wife.
You said you came to move your stuff.
I' m moving back in.
This is great.
Congratulations.
It' s kind of fortuitous.
- You serious?
- Yeah.
Are you gonna behave?
I' m actually afraid to leave you by yourself.
You won the sweepstakes, man.
You can do this later.
It' s a million bucks.
Let' s not lose focus.
You know, a honeymoon fund, a nursery wing for the...
This is the golden pot at the end of the storm thing!
Just sign it before you go in, huh?
I' m not gonna let you do this to yourself.
I' m gonna be sitting out here when you' re finished.
I can wait three minutes.
I' m a patient man.
I am a patient man.
Someone help me!
Is someone there?
Oh, shit.
I' m probably dead.
- <i>You' re not dead. </ i>
- Who' s that?
Turn on the lights!
Wish I could.
What the fuck is going on?
Where am I?
I don' t know yet.
What is that smell?
I don' t see a thing, asshole.
Shit!
Help!
No one can hear you.
- Calm down.
Just calm down.
- Are you hurt?
- I don' t know.
Yeah!
What' s your name?
My name is very fucking confused.
What' s your name?
What' s going on here?
I' m a doctor.
I just woke up here.
Just like you.
- Recognize that man?
- No.
- Do you have any idea how you got here?
- What' s the last thing you remember?
- Nothing.
I went to bed in my shit- hole apartment and woke up in an actual shit- hole.
What about you?
There' s not much to tell really.
I was on my way home from work and I don' t remember anything else.
First dead body I' ve ever seen.
Look different in real life.
They don' t move.
From the looks of these chains... someone didn' t want us to go very far either.
- Can you see any scars?
- What?
This is what they do.
They kidnap you and drug you... and before you know it, you' re in a bathtub and your kidneys are on eBay.
- No one has taken your kidneys.
- How can you tell from way over there?
Because you' d either be in terrible agony or you' d be dead by now.
Trust me.
- What are you, a surgeon?
- Yeah.
So, you going to tell me your name or what?
Adam.
Well, Adam... what we need to do... is start thinking about why we are here.
Whoever brought us here could' ve killed us by now.
But they didn' t.
They must want something from us.
Question is what.
- That clock.
- What about it?
- It' s brand- new.
- So?
So somebody obviously wanted us to know the time.
Wait.
I think I might be able to reach the door.
What is that?
Excuse me.
- It' s a tape.
- Where did you find it?
It was in my pocket.
It says "Play me."
Throw it over here.
No?
- Use your shirt.
- What?
Your shirt.
Come on.
It won' t work.
Look around.
There must be something else you can use.
- There' s nothing.
- There must be something.
You can do it.
Again.
<i>Rise and shine, Adam. </ i>
<i>You' re probably wondering where you are. </ i>
<i>I' il tell you where you might be. </ i>
<i>You might be in the room that you die in. </ i>
<i>Up until now, </ i> <i>you simply sat in the shadows... </ i> <i>watching others live out their lives. </ i>
<i>What do voyeurs see</ i> <i>when they look into the mirror? </ i>
<i>Now, I see you as a strange mix... </ i> <i>of someone angry and yet apathetic. </ i>
<i>But mostly just pathetic. </ i>
<i>So are you going to watch yourself</ i> <i>die today, Adam? </ i>
<i>Or do something about it? </ i>
I don' t get it.
Throw me the player.
No.
You throw me your tape.
Look, we' re going to have to work together if we want to get out of here.
Now, just throw it to me.
I' m not going to risk breaking it.
You throw me your tape.
This is your wake- up call. </ i>
<i>Every day of your working life, </ i> <i>you have given people the news... </ i> <i>that they are going to die soon. </ i>
<i>Now you will be the cause of death. </ i>
<i>Your aim in this game is to kill Adam. </ i>
<i>You have until 6: 00 on the clock to do it. </ i>
<i>There' s a man in the room with you. </ i>
<i>When there is that much poison</ i> <i>in your blood, the only thing left to do... </ i> <i>is shoot yourself. </ i>
<i>There are ways to win this... </ i> <i>hidden all around you. </ i>
<i>" X "marks the spot for the treasure. </ i>
<i>If you do not kill Adam by 6: 00... </ i> <i>then Alison and Diana will die, Dr. Gordon. </ i>
<i>And I' il leave you in this room to rot. </ i>
<i>Let the game begin. </ i>
Give me that.
Now.
Gordon. </ i>
<i>And I will leave you in this room to rot. </ i>
Any idea who that is?
<i>Let the game begin. </ i>
- He knows us.
- Come on.
What do you think?
Probably a joke, right?
<i>Let the game begin. </ i>
Listen.
<i>Follow your heart. </ i>
What the hell does "follow your heart" mean?
There, right next to you, on the toilet.
- Anything?
- No solids.
Take off the lid.
I really wish I had checked in there first.
What is it?
Mind passing me the other one?
Fuck!
He doesn' t want us to cut through our chains.
He wants us to cut through our feet.
I think I may know who' s done this to us.
- What did you say?
- It' s not someone I know personally.
It' s just someone I know of.
Jesus Christ!
Tell me.
Who is it?
The last I heard... the police still hadn' t caught him.
<i>And the only reason I know that</ i> <i>is because I was a suspect. </ i>
<i>I' il start from the beginning. </ i>
This one' s not fresh anymore.
At least three weeks out.
Victim' s a 46- year- old male.
Died of massive blood loss.
Mostly through the femoral artery.
He started at the back of the cage... and tunneled his way through that razor wire so fast... it' s amazing he got as far as he did.
Cut himself so deep, we found traces of stomach acid on the floor.
We also found this.
<i>Hello, Paul. </ i>
<i>You' re a perfectly healthy, sane, </ i> <i>middle- class male. </ i>
<i>Yet, last month, you ran a straight razor</ i> <i>across your wrists. </ i>
<i>Did you hurt yourself</ i> <i>because you truly wanted to die... </ i> <i>or did you just want some attention? </ i>
<i>Tonight, you' il show me. </ i>
<i>The irony is that if you want to die</ i> <i>you just have to stay where you are. </ i>
<i>But if you want to live, </ i> <i>you' il have to cut yourself again. </ i>
<i>One path through the razor wire to the door. </ i>
<i>But hurry.
At 3: 00 that door will lock... </ i> <i>and then this room becomes your tomb. </ i>
<i>How much blood will you shed</ i> <i>to stay alive, Paul? </ i>
The door was on a timer.
It was unlocked until 3: 00.
Then it snapped shut.
He was given two hours.
Jigsaw piece.
I think I' m gonna be here for a while.
The newspapers started calling him the "Jigsaw killer."
Actually, technically speaking, he is... not really a murderer.
He never killed anyone.
<i>He finds ways for his victims</ i> <i>to kill themselves. </ i>
<i>Hello, Mark, if you' re so sick... </ i> <i>then why do I have</ i> <i>so many photos of you up and about? </ i>
<i>Let' s put your so- called illness to the test. </ i>
<i>Right now, </ i> <i>there is a slow- acting poison in your veins. </ i>
<i>The antidote is inside the safe. </ i>
<i>The combination to the safe... </ i> <i>is written on the wall. </ i>
<i>Hurry up and program it in. </ i>
<i>But watch your step. </ i>
<i>By the way, that' s flammable substance</ i> <i>smeared on your body. </ i>
<i>So I would be careful with that candle, </ i> <i>if I were you... </ i>
Help. <i>... or all the people</ i> <i>you' ve burned with your act... </ i> <i>just might have their revenge. </ i>
I found something else.
Well, two things actually.
There was someone standing outside here watching through this peephole.
Looks like our friend Jigsaw likes to book himself front row seats to his sick games.
He was there at the last one as well.
Only this time, he left us his penlight.
- Get a rush on the prints.
- Copy that.
Started as a colon cancer.
The patient has come in for a standard checkup... by which we are able to monitor the rate at which his condition is declining.
- The patient had...
- His name is John, Dr. Gordon.
He' s a very interesting person.
Thank you for that information, Zep.
As you can see, our orderlies form very special bonds with the patients.
Gordon, please page the operator. </ i>
Obviously, someone doesn' t want me to tell you what the patient has.
Excuse me.
Sing.
Very impressive.
Thank you.
I do my best.
- Sorry to interrupt you while you' re working.
- That' s fine.
How can I help you, gentlemen?
Last night, Doctor.
Why is it that you' re interested?
We' d like to ask you a few questions about it.
For your sake, I think it' s best if we do it down at the station.
Would you like to follow us there?
No.
I' m afraid that' s quite out of the question.
I can' t just leave, I have work to do.
Plus, my wife has the car today.
That' s okay.
You can ride with us, Doc.
I' m sorry, you' il have to tell me again.
What is this all about?
Is this yours, Doctor?
So you have no idea how your penlight showed up at the murder scene?
Of course not.
I' il have to ask.
What were you doing last night?
I was seeing someone.
Who?
- Look, if you can' t be honest with me...
- I was visiting someone.
It wasn' t a patient.
What am I gonna do?
Well, as your lawyer and your friend, my advice to you is to bite the bullet... and give them your alibi now.
Because no one is going to believe you later.
That was five months ago.
He tried to set me up for murder.
We checked your alibi.
It holds up.
Good.
Can I go home now?
We have one of the victims who managed to escape.
Want to know if you wouldn' t mind sticking around and listening to her testimony?
- Maybe it' il trigger something.
- I' d like to help really but...
We' d really appreciate it.
- She' s the only one who made it.
- Okay.
Amanda... in your own time... tell me the first thing you remember.
<i>I woke up.
All I could taste was blood... </ i> <i>and metal. </ i>
<i>Hello, Amanda. </ i>
<i>You don' t know me, but I know you. </ i>
<i>I want to play a game. </ i>
<i>Here' s what happens if you lose. </ i>
<i>The device you' re wearing</ i> <i>is hooked into your upper and lower jaws. </ i>
<i>When the timer at the back goes off... </ i> <i>your mouth will be</ i> <i>permanently ripped open. </ i>
<i>Think of it like a reverse bear trap. </ i>
<i>Here, I' il show you. </ i>
<i>There is only one key to open the device. </ i>
<i>It' s in the stomach of your dead cellmate. </ i>
<i>Look around, Amanda. </ i>
<i>Know that I' m not lying. </ i>
<i>You better hurry up. </ i>
<i>Live or die.
Make your choice. </ i>
And then I saw the body.
There was a knife.
He' d been injected with an opiate overdose.
He couldn' t move or feel much of anything.
- You mean he was alive?
- Was.
What happened after you took it off?
<i>Congratulations.
You are still alive. </ i>
<i>Most people are so ungrateful to be alive. </ i>
Not anymore. </ i>
You are, in fact, a drug addict.
Isn' t that right, Mandy?
Do you think that is why he picked you?
Are you grateful, Mandy?
He helped me.
- Yeah, I' m sure.
How do I know you' re telling the truth?
You can be the one that put me in this room.
- I' m in exactly the same situation you are in.
- Wrong.
Information.
You know who did this.
You hear me?
I' il cut...
- What?
- It' s a two- way mirror.
I can see you.
<i>So that' s what this is.
Reality TV. </ i>
Don' t look at me.
I can' t help you.
Can you hear me in there?
I' m having a blast.
This is the most fun I' ve had without lubricant.
Make sure you' re getting everything.
That' s not going to do anything.
- <i>You just want to leave it running on us? </ i>
- <i>He won' t stop it. </ i>
That' s why we can' t cut through these chains.
It' s why you won' t break that glass.
Every possible angle has been pre- thought out by him.
You sound like you admire this prick.
To overcome something, you have to understand what a perfect engine it is.
That' s how you fight disease.
Now the tape told us to find an "X."
That "X" has to be somewhere in this room.
Help me find it.
How can you be the calm doctor- guy when your wife and kid are out there?
He' s got them, too.
He could be doing anything to them right now.
- Are you thinking about that?
- I am thinking about that.
I' ve been thinking about the last thing I said to my daughter.
Diana.
Honey, are you okay?
- Can you hear me?
- Mommy.
- What is it, sweetpea?
- There' s a man in my room.
Honey, are you sure he' s not just hiding in your imagination?
He talked to me.
- Okay, I' il come and check your room.
- I want Daddy.
He' il get the scary man.
All right, if you want.
Come on.
Larry, sorry to bother you, but your daughter had a bad dream again.
Just a minute.
She wants you to check her room.
Just got to finish this paragraph.
Come on, sweetie, I' il go check with you.
I' m done.
See, there' s no one in your room.
There' s no such thing as the bad man.
Now can you go to sleep?
- I' m still scared.
- You are?
Give me your tootsy.
What a big tootsy.
Remember this one?
"This little piggy went to market This little piggy stayed home
"This little piggy had roast beef This little piggy had none
"This little piggy went 'Whee' all the way home"
I hate that thing.
I have to go to work, sweetheart.
You know what Daddy' s job is like.
Now, come on.
Try and get some sleep now, okay?
You' re not going to leave us, are you, Daddy?
What?
What are you talking about?
You mean, leave you and Mommy?
No, sweetheart.
I would never do that.
- Who gave you that idea?
- No one.
It' s not true.
Okay?
How much do I love you?
- Very much.
That' s right.
- Good night, sweetie.
- Good night, Daddy.
- Tomorrow, I' il read your favorite story.
- Okay.
I don' t know how much longer I can do this.
What are you talking about?
How can you walk through life pretending you' re happy?
- I am happy.
- That is complete bullshit.
I' d rather you break down and tell me that you hated me.
At least there' d be some passion in it.
Would you like to see her?
- She' s beautiful.
- Thank you.
- You gonna have any more kids?
- We' ve talked about it, but... with our schedules, it' s difficult enough to concentrate on one.
So where is the lucky wife?
There' s another picture behind the one you' re looking at.
It' s my favorite one because we' re all in it together.
Someone, usually me, has to hold the camera... which means I' m always missing from the photos.
- It' s not here.
- What?
This photo you' re talking about is not here.
Are you sure?
- Yeah.
He must have taken it.
How can you walk through life pretending you' re happy?
- I am happy.
- That is complete bullshit.
I' d rather you break down and tell me that you hated me.
At least there' d be some passion in it.
We can talk about this later, okay?
Just leave.
<i>Good night, little girl. </ i>
Diana!
Mommy!
Mommy!
Don' t do that!
Leave her!
<i>You little man... </ i>
<i>I see you. </ i>
<i>Does Dr. Gordon know</ i> <i>you' re at home with his wife? </ i>
<i>I know you know something. </ i>
<i>What are you doing there? </ i>
<i>Waiting for the doctor? </ i>
<i>I' m waiting for the doctor, too. </ i>
<i>I know that she' il let you go. </ i>
<i>So you have no idea how your penlight</ i> <i>showed up at the murder scene? </ i>
We checked your alibi.
It holds up.
Isn' t that right?
<i>I know that she' il let you go. </ i>
Here we are.
That was quite an amazing story that poor woman told.
I' m sorry I can' t be of more help to your investigation.
You know, we arrested a dentist last week... who liked to play with kids a bit too much.
He lived two blocks from here.
The sewer lines run under this neighborhood, too, Doctor.
<i>Hello, Amanda. </ i>
<i>You don' t know me, but I know you. </ i>
<i>I want to play a game. </ i>
<i>Here' s what happens if you lose. </ i>
<i>There' s a timer</ i> <i>at the back of the device you' re wearing. </ i>

<i>Think of it like a reverse bear trap. </ i>
<i>I' il show you. </ i>
We' re gonna go down to The Grill, go get a beer.
You wanna come?
- I don' t think so.
Thanks, anyway.
- You know I always ask.
<i>There' s only one key... </ i>
I' il leave you to have fun here then.
<i>It' s in the stomach of your dead cellmate. </ i>
I don' t mean for this to be disrespectful.
Maybe you should find yourself a girlfriend.
<i>It' s in the stomach of your dead cellmate. </ i>
<i>Look around. </ i>
<i>Look around, Amanda. </ i>
<i>Know that I' m not lying. </ i>
<i>You better hurry up. </ i>
Wait!
Sing.
- Get back here.
- What?
Remember 118th Street?
K2K.
That gang' s territory was only about four blocks.
Listen to this.
We gotta check the records... from all fire emergencies that occurred there in the last two weeks.
Go.
Right now.
On the night of Tuesday, the 17th... we got a fire alarm going off in the rear wing of 213, Stygian Street.
Used to be a mannequin factory.
Think we have enough for a warrant now?
Who said anything about a warrant?
- Right now?
- Why not?
At least we' il have the cover of darkness.
Yeah, well, so will anybody else.
I got you.
What the hell is this?
Shit!
- Sing.
- What?
- Let' s see what' s he' s gonna do.
We got him.
We don' t know what he looks like.
Lets see what he' s gonna do.
No fucking way.
Fuck that.
I' m gonna take him.
What the fuck?
Shit!
Awake already, Jeff?
I need more powerful tranquilizers next time.
Don' t cry.
I' ve given your life a purpose.
You' re a test subject for something greater than yourself.
Police.
- Hold it right there!
Don' t move!
Put your fucking hands in the air!
Now you' il make a choice.
In 20 seconds, the life of this man will be ended.
- Shut up and get down here.
- Turn it off.
Sing, stop that thing.
I' m taking this bastard down.
Move!
- How do you turn it off?
- Tell him how to stop it!
- One key will unlock it.
- Where is it?
- It' s in the box.
- Box?
- Which key?
- Tell him which key it is.
- Time is running out.
- Get down here right now, asshole!
What' s more important to you, Officer... arresting me, or the life of another human being?
Get down on your knees!
- Jesus!
- Help me!
Yes, I am sick, Officer.
Tapp, it' s none of the keys here!
Sick from the disease eating away at me inside.
Sick of people who don' t appreciate their blessings.
Sick of those who scoff at the suffering of others.
I' m sick of all.
No!
Shit.
I' il be back.
Okay?
Or I' il shoot.
Got you on your knees.
You' re running.
You' re running scared because we had you.
I' m going to close this case.
We' re right, Sing.
We' re going to close this thing.
<i>" X "marks the spot. </ i>
<i>We should search this room again. </ i>
<i>What are you doing over there? </ i>
Excuse me.
Just because I' m stuck in this room with you... doesn' t mean I have to report to you every 10 seconds.
I really don' t see the point in us not helping one other.
What do you want me to do?
I' m on a leash.
We need to think.
I am thinking.
Then don' t keep me in the dark about what you' re thinking.
- Turn off the lights.
- What?
- Turn them off, now, please!
Just turn them off for a second.
Jesus!
Behind you.
- How come we didn' t see that before?
- The lights in here hadn' t charged it.
It must be glow- in- the- dark paint or something.
- Open it.
- It' s locked.
The key.
The one from my envelope.
Where is it?
Where the fuck...
Here.
Cell phone.
The most beautiful invention on this planet.
Make that second most beautiful invention.
- <i>Give me that. </ i>
- <i>Are you joking? </ i>
<i>You' re gonna put something we found</ i> <i>in this room in your mouth? </ i>
I' m willing to risk it.
Give me that sweet cancer.
I don' t care, I really don' t.
Give me one of those.
<i>The cigarettes are harmless, I promise. </ i>
<i>Smoking is only poisonous</ i> <i>when it ends in bloodshed. </ i>
<i>You don' t need a gun to kill Adam. </ i>
May I please have a cigarette?
I' m trying the police.
Shit.
This was meant to receive calls, not make them.
Wait a minute.
This has happened before.
<i>I was walking back to my car. </ i>
<i>I thought I was alone, </ i> <i>but I' m sure someone else was there. </ i>
It was waiting for me.
- How did you know to turn off the lights?
- Who cares?
It worked.
- Yeah, but how did you know?
- Instinct.
- Instinct?
- Yeah.
You know what?
You' re a terrible liar.
You say that like you know me.
What else aren' t you telling me?
Let' s see.
I didn' t tell you that.
I didn' t tell you my last girlfriend, a feminist vegan punk... broke up with me because she thought I was too angry.
- Stop it.
- You knew to turn off these lights.
- Whatever.
I' m dealing with a juvenile.
- You wanna know?
- Yeah.
Here it is.
Oh, God!
Where did you get this?
It was in your wallet, behind the photo of your daughter.
- Why didn' t you show me this before?
- I couldn' t.
I' m sorry.
What are you doing to them, you bastard?
Okay, I got to think now.
<i>You don' t need a gun to kill Adam. </ i>
<i>When there is that much poison</ i> <i>in your blood, the only thing left to do... </ i> <i>is shoot yourself. </ i>
What are you doing?
<i>Hey! </ i>
What the hell are you doing?
Adam, listen to me.
I want you to play along with me on this.
You got that?
So, you still want that cigarette?
Sure.
There, I' ve done it!
I' ve killed him with the poison, just like you wanted!
Now where is my family?
Where are they?
What?
- I just got electrocuted.
- What?
- That was our way out.
- Did you hear what I said?
Get this thing off me.
Get it off!
- Stop acting.
- You think I would make that up... just to mess up your stupid, fucking charade?
All right, that' s it!
Damn it!
I remember everything now.
I remember how I got here.
Great!
Is someone there?
I can hear you.
What the...
What the...
Who' s in there?
Come on out!
I' il kill you, you motherfucker.
- Who is this?
- <i>Daddy? </ i>
- Diana?
- Daddy, is that you?
Yeah, baby, it' s me.
I' m here.
I' m scared, Daddy.
Don' t worry, honey.
Everything' s going to be okay.
- <i>Where is Mommy? </ i>
- She' s here with me.
Let me talk to her, sweetie.
Put Mommy on.
The bad man from my room is here.
<i>He has us tied up... </ i> and he has a gun.
What man?
<i>Please come home, Daddy. </ i>
Hello?
Diana?
- Larry?
- Ali?
Is Adam there?
How do you know?
Ali, what is going on?
Don' t believe Adam' s lies.
<i>He knows you. </ i>
<i>He knew all about you before today. </ i>
Hello?
Ali?
God damn you!
If you so much as lay a finger on them, I' il kill you!
Do you hear me?
You son of a bitch.
I' il kill you!
Are they okay?
My wife, she mentioned your name.
What did she say?
She told me... not to believe you.
Believe me about what?
She told me you know me.
Who are you?
You know who I am.
Stop the lies.
You' re a liar!
I need to know the truth!
I' m a liar?
What did you do last night, Lawrence?
Work at a hospital?
Saving sick children?
You told me that after you left your house last night, you went to work at a hospital.
That' s because it' s the truth.
No, it' s not.
Your wife is right, Larry.
You don' t recall getting your picture taken in that parking lot?
I can prove that you didn' t go anywhere near a hospital last night.
It' s not the first time I' ve done it either, Larry.
I' ve been taking pictures of you for a few days now.
Why?
I get paid to take pictures of rich guys like you... who go to seedy, out- of- the- way motels to fuck their secretaries.
Last night I went to your house.
I watched you leave.
<i>I followed you... </ i> <i>all the way to that shitbag hotel. </ i>
You' ve had these with you the whole time?
I found them in there, with the hacksaws.
<i>I don' t know how they got there. </ i>
You' re so full of it!
Face it, Larry, we' re both bullshitters, but my camera isn' t.
It doesn' t know how to lie.
It shows you what' s put right in front of it.
Just out of curiosity, what did you do in that motel room?
You got out of there pretty fast.
Why did you deem it necessary to page me when you knew I was at home?
I didn' t know if you were gonna make it.
But I gave you a precise time at which to page me.
You can' t do that.
It' s not like I know the rules for this sort of stuff.
What' s wrong, Dr. Gordon?
Look, it was wrong of me to make you come here.
- But I thought we...
- Please.
I' m sorry.
- You tell anyone you were here?
- No.
- It' s for you.
- For me?
<i>I know what you' re doing, Doctor. </ i>
- I have to go.
- What happened?
I got to go.
- Who was it?
- Who was what?
The person who paid you to follow me?
Who was it?
He calls himself Bob and he gives me the money up front. $200 a night.
If I knew I was gonna end up here, I would' ve asked for more.
Does that mean you saw what happened to me?
That' s it.
I didn' t ask your name.
I didn' t know who you were.
I don' t know how I got here, I don' t know how you got here.
<i>I just took the shots</ i> <i>and went straight home to develop. </ i>
Next thing I know, I' m chained to a pipe... in some pre- historic bathroom... staring at the guy I' ve been taking shots of all night.
Clearly, whoever paid you to take pictures of me is the one who put us here.
- Maybe.
- What do you mean maybe?
Of course it is.
What did he look like?
- He was just a guy.
- Was he tall, skinny, obese, what?
I don' t take notes about his appearance.
- You must remember something of him.
- I can' t.
You don' t remember a thing about the guy?
- I told you...
- For fuck' s sake!
I give up!
He' s a tall, black guy.
He' s got a scar around his neck, okay?
Tapp!
Tapp.
The guy who paid me to take these photos was not a cop.
No.
He was discharged from the police force.
He broke down after his partner was killed.
But that didn' t stop him from harassing me.
The guy became obsessed.
He convinced himself I must have somehow been involved with the murders...
And you helped him.
You took money from him to invade my privacy.
- How could you do that?
- Call it my need to eat.
Right.
You know what?
You' re not a victim of this game...
- Really?
Obviously this cop thinks you' re the one behind it all.
I told you, he' s not a cop.
Just like you.
- What are you more pissed off about?
That I took some shots of you... or that I took shots while you were cheating on your wife?
- I did not cheat on her!
- Why do you care what I think anyway?
I don' t give a crap if you covered yourself in peanut butter... and had a 15 hooker gang- bang.
How did I get here?
I had everything in order.
My whole life was in perfect order.
Sweetheart, are you okay?
Mommy just needs you to be really strong right now.
I' m not going to let anybody hurt you.
You got that?
That' s my good girl.
- <i>besides your wife and daughter? </ i>
- <i>No. </ i>
<i>Well, there' s someone here. </ i>
I know him.
Zep!
His name is Zep.
He' s an orderly in my hospital.
You perverted little psychopath.
I' m gonna take great pleasure in seeing you pay for this!
You bastard!
Fuck!
Look.
We' re out of time.
- It' s okay.
- Mommy, help me.
Dr. Gordon' s time is up.
Now I gotta do what I' ve gotta do, and...
I' m afraid it has to be you that tells him he failed.
Is that you, Zep, you bastard!
I know it' s you, you son of a bitch!
- <i>Larry. </ i>
- Ali?
You failed.
Don' t move!
Stay on the ground.
Give me the phone.
Give it to me!
- Larry?
- Ali!
- Honey, are you all right?
- No.
No, we' re not...
Get down!
Larry, where are you?
I don' t know.
I' m being held captive in a room somewhere.
What are you talking about?
- <i>I' m so sorry, Ali. </ i>
- Larry, we need you here.
<i>I' m sorry for everything.
It' s my fault. </ i>
Please forgive me.
I' ve always been happy with you.
Mommy.
Ali!
Mommy, help me.
Freeze!
Oh, no.
What the fuck?
Mrs. Gordon?
Diana?
I' m gonna kill your husband now, Mrs. Gordon.
Lawrence!
Lawrence, get up!
Lawrence, get up!
I need you.
Thank God!
I thought you were dead.
- He electrocuted me.
- I told you.
The same thing happened to me, see?
I wasn' t lying, see?
Fuck this shit!
I' m gonna kill you, you sick asshole.
No!
Lawrence, calm down.
- There must be a way out of here.
- I can' t be calm!
My family needs me.
No, God!
Stop it.
Lawrence, please calm down.
There' s a way out.
No!
Oh, my God!
What are you doing?
Lawrence, what are you doing?
What are you...
Oh, my God!
No!
Lawrence, please!
I' m begging you.
Lawrence, it' s not me who did this to you.
- You have to die.
- No, I want to live.
- I' m sorry.
- I want to live.
My family...
I' ve done it!
Now show them to me.
Thank you very much, Officer.
- Larry?
- Did you get through to him?
There' s still no answer.
It' s all right.
Everything' s okay.
You bastard!
I' il fucking kill you.
I' il fucking kill you!
You' re too late.
- Why?
- It' s the rules.
You' re going to be all right.
You' re just wounded in the shoulder.
I have to go and get help.
If I don' t get help...
I' m going to bleed to death.
Don' t leave me.
No!
Don' t worry, I' il bring someone back.
I promise.
Lawrence!
We' re going to be okay?
I wouldn' t lie to you.
Key.
Key!
Zep. </ i>
<i>I want you to make a choice. </ i>

Mrs. Gordon?
There are rules. </ i>
- Why?
- It' s the rules.
Key to that chain is in the bathtub.
His name' s John.
He has an inoperable frontal lobe tumor...
Sick from the disease eating away at me inside.
Sounds like our friend Jigsaw.
<i>Sick of people</ i> <i>who don' t appreciate their blessings. </ i>
Looks like our guy likes to book himself front row seats to his sick games.
<i>Hello, Mark. </ i>
Gordon, I want to play a game. </ i>
<i>Most people are so ungrateful to be alive. </ i>
<i>But not you.
Not anymore. </ i>
Game over.
Don' t!
There' s full transparency.
There' s nothing about the Patriot Act I am ashamed of...... in any way, shape or form.
I' m the guy you call if there' s a violation or an abuse.
If you' ve got a poster child on this, I wanna see it.
I provide oversight.
Trent Lott said, the day the bill was introduced:
"Maybe now we can do things we' ve wanted to do the last 10 years."
No, a dictatorship would be a heck of a lot easier, no question about it.
I mean, they had all this on the shelf somewhere.
Ideas of things they would like to do.
Go for it. "
... that there had to be a surrender of certain of our rights.
There' s troubling definitions in the bill.
- Like me.
That' s the whole point.
And the next morning when we come in, it passes.
How could Congress pass this Patriot Act without even reading it?
Sit down, my son.
We don' t read most of the bills.
Do you really know what that would entail...... if we were to read every bill that we passed?
Well, the good thing, it would slow down the legislative process.
I couldn' t believe that virtually no member of Congress...... had read the Patriot Act before voting on it.
So I decided the only patriotic thing to do...... was for me to read it to them.
Members of Congress, this is Michael Moore...... I would like to read you the U. S. A. Patriot Act.
Section 210 of this code reads as follows... "
"Section 2703C..."
That' s exactly what we' re gonna do.
But I' m here to take somebody' s order.
What would you like?
- I' m gonna order some ribs.
We all know you can' t secure the homeland...... on an empty stomach.
And in order to remain secure...... everyone needs to sacrifice.
Especially little Patrick Hamilton.
I' m sure each of us has our own airport- security horror story.
But here' s my favorite.
The terrorist threat that was posed by his mommy' s breast milk.
I thought if I put a little bit on my lips, that would be sufficient...... because I' m tasting it.
She looked at me, and I felt like...... she was telling me, "Chug that."
She goes, "You need to drink more."
And of a 4- ounce bottle, I wound up drinking...... 2 more ounces of breast milk...... that then, because it' s touched my lips, has to be tossed.
While homeland security was making sure breast milk...... was kept off our planes...... they were also doing everything possible to ensure no one...... could light a firebomb onboard.
- I can bring that on the plane?
- Actually, yes, you' re fine.
One too many books of matches.
You can have four books and two lighters.
When we already have the shoe- bomber...... who would have blown up an airplane...... if he had a butane lighter, according to the FBl...... why would Transportation Security say it' s okay...... to take four books of matches and two lighters...... as you board a plane?
I' m guessing somebody put pressure on...... to say, "When an airplane lands, people wanna light up...... so don' t take their lighters away."
Let me see if I got this straight.
Old guys in the gym, bad.
Peace groups in Fresno, bad.
Breast milk, really bad.
Hey, no problem.
Or was something else going on?
This is where the Pacific Ocean meets the shores of Oregon.
One.
Part- time.
Meet Trooper Brooks.
I maybe get a chance to hit this stretch of highway...... once, maybe twice a week during my shifts.
You know, just to even drive up here and look.
You know, I mean, as far as I know, there' s lots of things they could do.
I don' t even wanna suspect, because it just makes me ill inside.
Trooper Kenyon had to come in on his day off...... to catch up on some paperwork.
For the most part, especially during summer, when people show up...... this is what they get.
It just basically explains that due to our cutbacks...... our office is not open for administrative business.
There' s a sign that explains when the office is closed...... they can use the phone booth to get in touch with our dispatch.
Ironically enough, that phone is a piece of junk.
It doesn' t work very well, so half the time...... they pick up the phone and dispatch gets static.
For Tuesday, there' il be no troop on patrol.
Thursday, there' il be no troop on patrol.
And I don' t hardly ever respond to that anymore.
I asked, "How many people do we have in Oregon...... on duty tonight?"
And we had eight troopers...... on for the entire state of Oregon, working.
I think Oregon is a prime example that homeland security...... is not as secure as what people would like to believe.
Nobody' s sent me a manual that says, "Here' s how you catch a terrorist."
If I had that manual, I' d read it.
The Bush administration didn' t hand out a manual...... on how to deal with the terrorist threat...... because the terrorist threat wasn' t what this was all about.
They just wanted us to be fearful enough...... so that we' d get behind what their real plan was.
Four minutes.
- Right from the top.
- How much time?
- Three minutes.
- Thirty seconds.
- Fifteen seconds.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five...... four, three, two, one.
My fellow citizens...
At this hour, American and coalition forces...... are in the early stages of military operations...... to disarm Iraq...... to free its people and to defend the world from grave danger.
On my orders, coalition forces have begun striking...... selected targets of military importance...... to undermine Saddam Hussein' s ability to wage war.
On March 19th, 2003......
A nation that had never threatened to attack the United States.
A nation that had never murdered a single American citizen.
I think this piece of my neighbor.
Young girl, age 20.
I think it' s the other part of her body.
There is a lot of innocent civilians that were killed.
And pretty much at first shot anything that moved.
When war happens and fighting starts...... it' s like we' re pumped up, motivated, ready to go.
Because you know you' re going into the fight...... then you got a good song playing in the background.
And that gets you real fired up.
Ready to do the job.
When you put your helmet on you can hear it through the helmet.
When we travel, we kill the enemy...
"Let the bodies hit the floor"...... is fitting for the job.
At the time we wanted it to burn to get Saddam and his regime out.
The roof, the roof The roof is on fire
We don' t need no water Let the motherfucker burn
Burn, motherfucker, burn
This is a totally different picture here being pushed into the city.
Urban warfare in a tank.
You don' t know who' s friendly, who' s the enemy.
This is a lot more real and true than just a video game.
A lot of this is face to face.
And all the smells around you from the people lying dead, rotted.
It' s a lot more gruesome than you think.
We called in with some artillery and some napalm and things.
Some innocent women and children got hit.
And...... husbands carrying their dead wives and things like that.
You' re like:
What the hell do we do now? "
The targeting capabilities and the care that goes into targeting...... is as impressive as anything anyone could see.
- Good.
Get the other one.
The care that goes into it, the humanity that goes into it.
Honestly, I think we should just trust our president...... in every decision he makes, and we should support that.
And be faithful in what happens.
- Do you trust this president?
- Yes, I do.
Britney Spears was not alone.
The majority of the American people...... trusted the president.
And why shouldn' t they?
He' d spent the better part of the last year...... giving them every reason why we should invade Iraq.
Saddam Hussein has gone to elaborate lengths...... spent enormous sums...... taken great risks to build and keep weapons of mass destruction.
Saddam Hussein is determined to get his hands on a nuclear bomb.
Nuclear weapon.
Mobile production facilities.
He' s got them.
He' s got them.
Huh, that' s weird.
Because that' s not what Bush' s people said when he first took office.
He hasn' t developed capability...... with respect to weapons of mass destruction.
He' s unable to project conventional power against his neighbors.
We' re able to keep arms from him.
Military forces haven' t been rebuilt.
Saddam Hussein aids and protects terrorists...... including members of al Qaeda.
There was a relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda.
Saddam.
It' s only a matter of time before terrorist states...... armed with weapons of mass destruction...... develop the capability to deliver those weapons to U. S. Cities.
We' re giving you facts and conclusions...... based on solid intelligence.
He' s a man who hates America.
This is a man who cannot stand what we stand for.
There' s willingness to terrorize himself.
He hates the fact, like al Qaeda does, that we love freedom.
After all, this is a guy that tried to kill my dad at one time.
They got people to believe there was a threat when in fact there wasn' t one.
It doesn' t seem to bother people.
The Democrats were there to put a stop to all these falsehoods.
I' il vote to give the president authority he needs.
United States is prepared to lead the coalition of the willing that will do it.
When I say we will lead a coalition of the willing...... to disarm him if he chooses not to disarm, I mean it.
- Who' s in that coalition of the willing?
- You will find out who' s in it.
Roll call.
The Republic of Palau.
The Republic of Costa Rica.
The Republic of Iceland.
So it looked like we' d be doing most of the invading stuff ourselves.
- Then there was also:
The Kingdom of Morocco.
Morocco wasn' t officially a member of the coalition...... but according to one report, they did offer to send 2000 monkeys...... to help detonate land mines.
These are men of vision.
The Netherlands.
And I' m proud to call them allies.
Afghanistan.
Afghanistan?
They had an army.
Our army.
Just keep invading countries.
Yes, with our mighty coalition intact, we were ready.
One could almost say it' s the mother of all coalitions.
Fortunately, we have an independent media in this country...... who would tell us the truth.
The rallying around the president, the flag and the troops has begun.
And we' re gonna win!
You have to be with troops to understand the adrenaline.
I want you to know, I think Navy SEALs rock.
The pictures you' re seeing are absolutely phenomenal.
When my country' s at war, I want my country to win.
Iraqi opposition has faded in the face of American power.
What you' re watching here is truly historic television and journalism.
They had to strap me in with my camera at the back of the plane.
An awesome, synchronized killing machine.
There is an inherent bias...... in the coverage of the American press in general.
Am I slanted and biased?
You damn well bet I am.
But one story the media wasn' t covering...... was the personal story...... of each and every soldier who was killed in the war.
The government would not allow any cameras...... to show the coffins coming home.
That kind of story is a downer...... especially when you' re getting ready for a party on a boat.
My fellow Americans...... major combat operations in Iraq have ended.
In the battle of Iraq...... the United States and our allies have prevailed.
162, the number of troops killed by hostile fire.
- 244 U. S. Troops...
- 384 U. S. Troops lost their lives...
- Total killed, 484.
- Died in the line of duty, 500... 631 American troops...
More than 825 troops have been killed in Iraq.
The largest number of American military deaths since Vietnam.
There are some who feel like that if they attack us...... that we may decide to leave prematurely.
They don' t understand, if that' s the case.
Let me finish.
My answer is, bring them on.
But it' s not that easy to conquer a country, is it?
The renewed battle for control of Iraq raged for a fourth day today...... with street clashes in nearly every corner of the country.
Iraq could become "another Vietnam."
Officials say they see evidence that Sunni and Shiite extremists...... might be joining forces.
They' re not happy they' re occupied.
I wouldn' t be happy if I were occupied either.
Two Japanese aid workers and a journalist...... kidnapped by men calling themselves...... the Mujahideen Squadrons.
They threatened to burn the hostages alive...... if Japan does not withdraw its troops from Iraq within three days.
What' s happened?
You wanna give us your name?
Hamill, Thomas.
The Pentagon might keep up to 24, 000 troops in combat...... beyond their tour.
They talk about retention.
I don' t think anybody did.
I don' t have any clue as to why we' re still in Iraq.
If Donald Rumsfeld was here, I' d ask him for his resignation.
With the war not going as planned...... and the military in need of many more troops...... where would they find the new recruits?
Military experts say three times...... the 120, 000 U. S. Troops now deployed...... would be needed to pacify and rebuild the country.
Places where one of the only jobs available...... was to join the Army.
Places like my hometown of Flint, Michigan.
And while watching, I got to thinking...... there' s parts of Flint that look like that.
And we ain' t been in a war.
Look at the neighborhood I live in.
Most of them are abandoned.
You know, I mean...... that' s not right.
Come right here.
Come right here.
I e- mailed him.
But you have to take into consideration as well...... that when your unemployment runs out you' re no longer counted.
I would say that we' re close to at least 50 percent...... not working or underemployed.
Because being underemployed is just as dangerous.
My family has gone through the welfare system...... when it was Job Central.
I went to a secretary school.
Interesting.
"Why do you always go for the underdog?"
It was because the underdog is who needed me.
People that don' t have anything, that' s who I have to fight for.
And that' s who I have fought for my entire life.
"The military is a good option.
I can' t pay your way.
So I, as a mother, started teaching my children...... about the options that the military could do.
They would take them around the world.
They' d see all the things that I, as a mother, couldn' t let them see.
It' d pay for their education that I, as their mother and father, couldn' t pay.
The military is a good option for kids in Flint.
The military is an excellent option for the people of Flint.
How many of you have a friend or a family member in the service?
Anybody currently serving overseas?
- A brother of mine.
Yeah, cousin.
- Where' s your brother?
- Iraq.
Germany.
My cousin got shipped off to Iraq, like, three days ago.
There' s, like, an Army or Navy recruiter...... or Marines recruiter up there almost every week...... in the lunchroom recruiting students at the lunchroom.
There are people with a calling.
Most serve one weekend a month and two weeks a year.
Earning money for college.
Protecting their community.
In the Army National Guard...... you can.
I' m gonna take a year off after high school.
I wanna be an aircraft maintenance technician.
I noticed it was odd.
More like he was hiring me than recruiting me for the Army.
He came up like he was handing us a business card.
Meet Marine Staff Sergeant Dale Kortman...... and Sergeant Raymond Plouhar.
They are two of the many recruiters assigned to Flint, Michigan.
They' re very busy these days.
Look, he' s running away already.
- He' s seen us coming.
What have we got here?
- Need a little gangster.
We' re heading over to the Courtland Mall right now.
Genesee Valley Mall in the suburbs.
They have a hard time recruiting young people there.
Instead, they went to the other mall.
And then we' il walk straight down and straight back and then go down...
You guys ever think about joining up?
I thought about going to college and playing basketball.
Especially basketball.
Travel around the world for the Corps basketball team.
- Oh, was he?
Yeah, you can definitely hook it up.
Right now somebody out there wants to be a Marine but has no idea how to.
- I work at KFC.
- Sweet.
- Yes.
They' re waiting to get recruited.
I was gonna try a career in music or something.
Let the Marines go for it.
I' m sure you know who Shaggy is.
- You know anything about him?
- Yeah, he' s the Jamaican singer.
How about a former Marine?
- Did you know it?
You need to know discipline if you' re gonna get into music.
If you make a million, you need to manage that money.
- A plan?
- What you got going this afternoon?
10: 00 Monday morning?
- That sounds pretty good.
- You want me to pick you up?
It' s better to get them when they' re in ones and twos...... and work on them that way.
Ladies, ready to join up?
Green hat right behind us.
He' s young.
We got two over here...... right over by the red van.
You go that way, I go this way, we corner them.
- Yes, sir.
Man, you look older than ninth grade.
All right, here' s my card.
You ever thought about being a Marine, man?
I' ve got a wife and kid now.
Even more reason to join up.
What I want to do, man...... is get information from you so I can scratch you off my list...... saying I' ve talked to you, and you' re not interested.
What' s your address?
Add another one to the list.
You know, stuff young people can do without having the risk...... of dying in the process, I guess I can say candidly.
However, we are in a combat zone, and my soldiers do recognize that fact.
Everybody' s a little bit nervous about it, I guess.
We' re gonna take care of you.
I promise.
Every house here has the right to have weapons.
Maximum, one AK- 47.
We always expect the targets to be armed.
Rock 'n' roll.
This goddamn thing to pry doors open.
Pop this in there...
Where' s she going?
- Where' s she going?
She' s gonna call him.
Where is he at right now?
Not on the phone.
Is he in the house?
- Is he in the house?
He is in the house?
- Get up there, second floor!
Go, go, go!
Watch out, Adele, watch out.
I have one coming up.
That' s Suheib Al Douri?
- Suheib.
- This is Suheib.
Tell them to calm down, please.
We will not be long.
This is the target.
Suheib Al Douri.
We have to, as you go back to the old saying...... win the hearts and minds of the people.
That' s our job.
The ideal of democracy and freedom to the country...... and show them that the American people are not here to rule Iraq.
I start doing evidence turn- in.
That process takes about three hours.
That concludes Christmas Eve.
Santa came to Iraq just for you guys.
Trying to keep skies clear for you, Santa.
Absolutely.
I' m an extremely proud American.
I' m probably more proud...... than the average Joe.
Because I know the lives that were lost and the blood that was shed...... so that I could be here and have a flag.
- Every single day.
Every day.
I started when my daughter was in Desert Storm.
I had the same flag...... flying on my front porch and the same yellow ribbons.
And everybody' s child would come home safe.
- And she did.
Absolutely.
Uncles, aunts...... cousins, brothers, father.
My family was...
My family is what I consider...... part of the backbone of America.
There' s hundreds of families, millions of families...... that this country was founded on their backs.
I have been known to be a conservative Democrat.
- It' s a great country.
A great country.
The cross that I choose to wear is a multicultural, multicolor cross.
That' s because I believe that all God' s people come in many colors.
And my family itself is multicultural.
You have a daughter who went into the military.
Then your first- born son, in the military.
That' s quite a gift to the country from your family.
So having a son in the Army, pretty proud thing.
He made it.
What was your reaction to protestors during the Gulf War or Vietnam?
I always hated the protestors.
It was just a slap in my face.
It was just like they were dishonoring my son.
And I burned in my soul to tell them, "You don' t understand.
They' re not there because they wanna be there. "
They were protesting the concept of the war.
I know I' m a soldier, and I' m here to do a job.
I' ve been a soldier for a while.
Once you have to go and do your job...... and you see the things that you see...... I was saying, there' s some disillusionment in that.
Battalion commander fully expects us to be...... attacked in some type of way...... before we get to FARP Shell.
Not much has happened.
But be aware that it can, and it probably will.
The kids get together a lot.
Well, I can' t say kids...... but guys about 17, 18...... starting to come together.
Why, I' m not really sure.
Immoral behavior breeds immoral behavior.
When a president commits the immoral act...... of sending otherwise good kids to war based on a lie...... this is what you get.
And I don' t understand it.
We' re trying to help these people, and it seems...... they don' t want our help.
The minute something goes wrong, "Why weren' t you here?
Why didn' t you do this? "
I hate this country.
Yeah, that statement is very true.
You cannot kill someone without killing a part of yourself.
If you get called up...... will you go back to Iraq?
Possible jail time.
That' s one possible thing.
- Are you willing to risk that?
- Yes.
I will not let my person...
I will not let anyone...... send me back over there to kill other poor people.
Especially when they pose no threat to me and my country.
I won' t do it.
The haves...... and the have- mores.
I call you my base.
While Bush was busy taking care of his base...... and professing his love for our troops...... he proposed cutting combat soldiers' pay by 33 percent...... and assistance to their families by 60 percent.
He opposed giving veterans...... a billion dollars more in health- care benefits...... and he supported closing veteran hospitals.
He tried to double the prescription drug costs for veterans...... and opposed full benefits for part- time reservists.
When Staff Sergeant Brett Petriken from Flint...... was killed in Iraq on May 26th...... the Army sent his last paycheck to his family...... but they docked him for the last five days of the month he didn' t work...... because he was dead.
They say they' re not gonna leave any veteran behind...... but they' re leaving all kinds of veterans behind.
Yes.
Didn' t get the proper coverage they deserved.
There' s a death toll, but not showing the injured or amputated.
- Yeah.
And the pain is like my hands are being crushed in a vise.
But they do a lot to help it...... and they take a lot of the edge off it.
It makes it a lot more tolerable.
I was injured in late April on patrol in Baghdad.
A couple of guys come out and ambushed us.
I got nerve damage and stuff like that.
I' m constantly in pain.
I take a lot of morphine...... to help with that and stuff.
You know, just readjusting.
Getting life back on track.
I' m not gonna do what it is that I did before.
I was a Republican for quite a few years.
They conduct business in a very dishonest way.
I' m gonna be incredibly active in the Democratic Party...... down where I live once I get out.
I' m gonna definitely do my best...... to ensure that the Democrats win control.
Iraq, Baghdad, I didn' t know anything of those things.
And he didn' t want to have to go to Iraq.
So we had a conversation about, sometimes some fear is healthy...... because it keeps our senses about us.
But he knew he was going to Baghdad.
Just glued, completely glued to the television...... in hopes of seeing a glimpse of him.
Can' t you please let us see him? "
All I heard was, "Black Hawk down, South Central Iraq."
What I can tell you at this hour is that last night...... the Army did, indeed, lose a Black Hawk helicopter.
We are being told by officers on the ground...... that there were six occupants inside the Black Hawk.
"You push those sad thoughts out of your mind.
You gotta help me through this. "
The Army called me, and I remember getting on the phone and him saying...
And he said, "Mother of Sergeant Michael Pedersen?"
And I remember dropping the telephone.
And all I can honestly say that I remember...... is, "Ma' am, the United States Army...... the secretary of defense regretfully informs you..."
That' s all I know.
The grief grabbed me so hard...... that I literally fell on the floor.
And I was alone.
I didn' t have anybody to pick me up.
So I literally crawled over to my desk...... and was hanging on.
"Why does it have to be Michael?
Why did you have to take my son?
Why is it my son you had to take?
He wasn' t a bad guy.
He was a good guy.
Why did you have to take my son? "
I...
Or a wife, for that matter.
It pains me.
Do you have his last letter?
It was mailed March 16th...... but I didn' t get it until probably a week before he was killed.
Hey, Mama.
Well, sorry I haven' t been able to call.
They took the phone seven days ago.
I got the letter and box.
That is so cool.
Your first grandson came...... the same day your oldest son did.
How is everyone?
I' m doing fine.
We are just out here in the sand and windstorms waiting.
Trying to be like his dad, Bush.
He got us out here for nothing whatsoever.
I am so furious right now, Mama.
I really hope they do not re- elect that fool, honestly.
I am in good spirits, and I am doing okay.
I really miss you guys.
Thanks for the Bible...... and books and candy.
I really look forward to letters from you guys.
Well, tell all the family hello and that I am doing fine.
We don' t expect anything to happen any time soon.
I cannot wait to get home and get back to my life.
Tell Sputnik congrats...... and I' il see my first nephew soon...... as soon as I get back to the States.
Hope you guys are doing okay...... and keep sending the mail.
It makes getting through the days easier.
Well, I am on my way to bed...... so I will write you guys soon.
I love and miss...... all of you guys. "
I want him to be alive...... and I can' t make him alive.
But your flesh just aches.
It' s out of sync.
A parent is not supposed to bury their child.
I feel sad for my family...... because we lost our son.
But...... I really feel sorry for the other families...... that is losing their kids as we speak.
L...
I guess the sickening part.
For what?
You' ve heard a lot about Halliburton lately.
Criticism is not failure.
Our employees are doing a great job.
We' re rebuilding Iraq.
It' s a war zone.
We' re serving the troops because of what we know...... not who we know.
Let me tell you about Halliburton, the company I ran.
The people are proud of what they' ve accomplished.
I, frankly...... don' t feel any need to apologize...... for the way I' ve spent my time over the last five years...... as the CEO and chairman of a major American corporation.
This is also an attempt to divert attention...... from the fact they have no energy policy.
And as the secretary of energy said, "We were caught unawares."
In the middle of the war, Microsoft, DHL and other corporations...... invited Halliburton to a conference...... to figure out how much money could be made in Iraq.
You, industry, are definitely a vital part of that effort.
We appreciate your interest in this.
We need you.
You big guys are gonna get it.
USTDA is for you.
Once that oil starts flowing...... and money coming, gonna be lots of money.
No question of how much money' s there.
The lack of transparency, the corruption.
I think the profits American companies are making, the main companies...... are so overwhelming.
It' s the American taxpayer that' s gonna pay for that.
And it' s gonna get better.
Start building relationships.
Because it' s gonna get much better...... as the oil flows and their budgets increase.
Good news is, whatever it costs, the government will pay you.
The business of war.
Supporting U. S. Government and military.
The real heroes of the campaign and the reconstruction...... are the men and women of the U. S. Armed Forces.
We' re proud of being any part we can in supporting them.
Halliburton delivers hot meals, supplies, clean clothing...... and communications to our soldiers...... so they can be a little closer to home.
It' s a girl!
Proud to serve our troops.
I just read in the paper Halliburton got another contract.
Which is not being...... contested at all.
Because nobody knows.
Well, it' s in the paper, so somebody knows.
It' s too late.
The United States is now a major player in the Iraqi oil business.
American troops guard the oil fields...... as Texas oil workers assess their potential.
We don' t feel any risk.
We feel we' re being well protected here, or we wouldn' t be here.
I mean...... I make anywhere between 2 and 3000 a month.
A Halliburton employee out here driving a bus...... can make between 8 and 10, 000 a month.
Go figure.
Where' s the justification in that?
There' s no other single area of the world today...... with the opportunity for business, new business...... similar to the opportunity that' s available today in Iraq.
We' re supporting him and our troops.
We wanna make sure that the efforts and the lost lives...... wasn' t for no reason.
Nobody would worry about it.
Unfortunately, at least for the near term...... we think it' s gonna be a good situation, a dangerous situation.
Good for business, bad for the people.
And Wolfowitz was saying:
"The Iraqi people are much, much better off.
Isn' t it better that we got rid of Saddam...... and now the Iraqi people can do what they wanna do...... and really be free? "
No, they' il not be free.
And where are the weapons of mass destruction?
We were really duped.
And these poor people...... the young men and women who are being killed there.
- That' s it.
- That' s a disgrace.
They died in a just cause, for defending freedom...... and they will not have died in vain.
To attend a jobs conference.
On her break, she said she was going to go...... and pay a visit to the White House.
Iraqi children.
- Killed my people in Spain, yesterday.
- Yes, my son.
- Yes.
For oil.
Bush is a terrorist.
This is all staged.
- This is all staged.
- You tell me my son is not a stage.
- He was killed in Karbala.
It' s not a stage.
My son is dead.
There are a lot of other people too.
Blame al Qaeda.
What did that woman yell at you?
That I' m supposed to blame the al Qaeda.
The al Qaeda didn' t make a decision to send my son to Iraq.
Ignorance that we deal with, with everyday people.
People think they know...... but you don' t know.
I thought I knew, but I didn' t know.
I need my son.
God, it' s tougher than I thought it was gonna be...... to be here.
But it' s freeing also...... because I finally have a place...... to put all my pain and all my anger...... and to release it.
Especially when, out of the 535 members of Congress...... only one had an enlisted son in Iraq.
I asked Corporal Henderson of the United States Marine Corps...... to join me on Capitol Hill...... to see how many members of Congress we could convince...... to enlist their children to go to Iraq.
- Hey, Michael.
How are you doing?
- John Tanner, from Tennessee.
- What y' all doing?
- United States Marine Corps.
- 1968 to '72.
- You have kids?
- Yeah.
Is there any way we can get them to enlist...... and go over there and help out with the effort?
- I' ve got all the brochures.
- One of them has got two children.
In fact, only one.
- That' s right.
- I don' t disagree.
Oh, good.
Well, take some brochures.
- Thank you.
- Yeah, well...
- Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Michael Moore.
- How you doing today?
I' m trying to get members of Congress to get their kids to enlist in the Army...... and go over to Iraq.
Congressman.
Congressman Castle?
Congressman.
Congressman Doolittle, Michael Moore.
I was wondering if...
Of course, not a single member of Congress...... wanted to sacrifice their child for the war in Iraq.
And who could blame them?
Who would wanna give up their child?
Would you?
Would he?
I' ve always been amazed that the very people...... forced to live in the worst parts of town...... go to the worst schools and who have it the hardest...... are always the first to step up to defend that very system.
They serve so that we don' t have to.
They offer to give up their lives so that we can be free.
It is remarkable, their gift to us.
And all they ask for in return...... is that we never send them into harm' s way...... unless it' s absolutely necessary.
Will they ever trust us again?
He had used weapons.
Around Tikrit, Baghdad and east, west, south and north.
There is a tie between Iraq and what happened on 9 l 11.
The struggle can only end...... with their complete and permanent destruction.
We wage a war to save civilization itself.
But we will fight it, and we will prevail.
George Orwell once wrote...... that, "It' s not a matter of whether the war is not real or if it is.
It is meant to be continuous.
A hierarchical society is only possible...... on the basis of poverty and ignorance.
This new version is the past...... and no different past can ever have existed.
In principle, the war effort is always planned...... to keep society on the brink of starvation.
The war is waged by the ruling group against its own subjects.
And its object is not the victory over either Eurasia or East Asia...... but to keep the very structure of society intact. "
Fool me once...... shame on...
Shame on you.
You fool me, we can' t get fooled again.
For once, we agreed.

Your Grace
All things are good when taken to excess
Come on, let' s go
Where are you going?
Claudio!
Your scarf, my son!
Sorry, we' re obeying orders
Marrying each others' daughters will seal our destinies for ever
President, take as your lawful spouse His Excellency' s daughter, Tatiana
President, I will marry your daughter, Susy
Your Excellency and my brother the Bishop will marry my daughters
The preparations for our undertaking are completed
In puberty' s ambush, maidens bloom, all unaware of impending doom
They listen to the radio, drink tea, unaware they will lose their liberty
Bourgeois recoil not from slaughter though victim be son and daughter
- What' s this one' s name?
- Claudio Cicchetti
- What is your name?
- Franco
I knew you' d consider him
A girl helped us catch him
The fool thought he was in for romance, and ended up in a sack
- What is your name?
- Sergio
Shouldn' t we inspect them?
Trousers down, shirts up
That will do
Lamberto Gobbi
Carlo Porro
Umberto Chessari... just look at him, gentlemen
I waited two whole weeks to ambush him
... and this is Ferruccio Tonna, from Castelfranco
From a subversive family
The one with the curly hair, Tonino Orlando
I know him
I' ve waited two long years for him
Your Excellency, please help me
His father was a senior judge, like myself
A southerner, aren' t you?
Don' t expect me to deflower you.
In time we will decide..... who will do you that delightful honour
That' s right, Tonino
Eva, come along
Try to behave yourself
Come, no one will harm you
Show these nice gentlemen all your hidden charms
What a beauty
A delicious bum, solid yet bouncy
Tits to revive a dying cripple
Bring us another one
Signora Castelli, your turn.
The gentlemen are waiting
Please let me go home
Albertina' s father is a professor in Bologna
To slip her out of the convent school we had to convince two nuns
You' il prefer us to the sisters, won' t you?
I don' t know yet, sir
Very well, undress her
Just a moment
We didn' t notice her blemish.
She' s a pretty virgin, too
Don' t you disgrace me, I know your little tricks
We waited until she came out with her mother...... pushed the mother into the river, where the damned fool drowned...... right before this angel' s eyes
There were nine boys, now only eight
Anyone know the difference between "8", "no- no", and the family?
What' s the difference?
"8" is twice four, "no- no" is twice not for
- What about the family?
- They' re fine, thank you
Everything is prepared according to your wishes
You herded, feeble creatures, destined for our pleasure
Don' t expect to find here the freedom granted in the outside world
You are beyond reach of any "legality"
No one knows you are here
As far as the world goes, you are already dead
These are the laws which will govern your lives

ClRCLE OF MANlAS
I was born at a girls' boarding school, where my mother was a servant
One day, my sister asked if I knew Professor Gentile
"... to show you something he' s shown me"
She said:
"Don' t run away
"He' il give you some money"
I ran out to meet him.
I couldn' t believe it
- "Where are you going?"
- "To put away the chairs, Professor"
"Your sister will do that.
I' il show you something you' ve never seen "
I followed him into a room
He took his huge penis from out of his trousers and began to masturbate
"Have you ever seen the like?
"I' ve shown your sister and girls of your age
"Give me a hand.
Provoke the semen from which we' re all created
"I' il make it spurt on your face
"... and you are about to see it"
At that very moment...... l was immersed in a white jet, drenching me from head to toe
You mustn' t omit any detail...... otherwise your stories will not arouse us sufficiently
I know I was urged to give every detail...... every particular, even the slightest...... that may illuminate the human passion
I' ve not overlooked anything
You haven' t given us details about the size of the Professor' s penis...... or the nature, the consistency of his emisssion
Did you fondle his genitals, did he oblige you to do so?
Dear Signora Vaccari, more clarity
From now on I shall conceal nothing.
May I continue?
Time the staff of my old age had some fun
Shortly after my seventh birthday...... l took a girl friend to see the Professor
One of his colleagues was with him.
They drew me inside
Looking at me, one said to the other:
"Goffredo, didn' t I tell you she was a little beauty?"
"She is a rare little jewel", replied Goffredo
Then he took me onto his lap and gave me a kiss
- "How old are you?"
- "Seven, Professor"
"You are fifty years younger than me"
Then he gave me another kiss
Meanwhile, the other prepared some kind of strange syrup
They made me drink it, saying:
"It will make you pee"
"All we want of you, dear child, is that you urinate
"And that you do that with me, alone together"
I want this miserable boy punished severely
We are at your service
He had the insolence to pull away from me
You can choose one of ours
No, thank you
It would take too much to satisfy me now
A moment ago, only the slightest effort would suffice, but now...
You know to what we' re driven by frustrated desire
All I ask of you...... is exemplary punishment for this bastard
My Lord, I feel ready to satisfy you
I need no instruction
No, let me be
There are a thousand occasions when one does not desire a woman' s anus
I' il wait.
Let Signora Vaccari continue her story
Everything was so arranged that he swallowed every drop of my piss
At that moment his penis, overcome by victory...... cried tears of blood over me
Then, passion consumed, the Professor seemed to realize...... his idol no longer inspired such religious fervour
Without ado, he put ten lire in my apron pocket and pushed me out
The boy' s hopeless at masturbation, he needs a lesson
You' d think he' d never seen a man' s tool
Well, friends...... Signora Vaccari will turn them into first- class whores
Nothing is more contagious than evil
You are mistaken, Your Excellency
Some can do evil only when passion drives them to it
They are always unhappy, regretting the evils of the previous night
Umberto, Franco... what do you say?
Handsome
Efisio, it' s my turn
On the Peratibridge
A black flag flies
The mourning of the Julian regiment that goes to war
The best young men lie under the earth
The gentleman are not satisfied with you
The first thing you must learn is how to hold it
Go on
Up and down
Squeeze it harder...... and stroke beneath with the other hand
Slut!
See how it' s done
There were nine girls, now only eight
Here' s a number eight story
It' s about a man who had a friend named Six- times- eight
Going home in the blackout one night they lost each other
Our man tried to find his friend, looking everywhere
At last he thought he saw something in the darkness
He was overjoyed, thinking he had found his friend
- He cried:
"Six- times- eight!"
- "Forty- eight", came the reply
Music!
Signora Vaccari will tell us another story...... to stimulate us for another skirmish
I was nine when my sister took me to Milan to meet Signora Calzetti
She examined me and asked if I wanted to work for her
I said I would, if the pay was good
My first client, a stout man named Vaccari, looked me over carefully
At once I showed him my pussy, which I thought was very special
He covered his eyes:
"Out of the question
"I' m not interested in your vagina, cover it up"
He covered me up, making me lie down
He said:
"All these little whores know is to flaunt their vaginas
"Now I' il have to recover from that disgusting sight"
He wrapped me in a sheet, like a mummy...... leaving only my behind uncovered
He caressed it gently, opened and closed the cheeks...... began to suck it greedlily
Then he carefully...... put his member between my buttocks, his movements became frenzied
"Such an adorable behind, the sweet little anus.
Now I' il anoint it "
He said that three or four times
I never saw him again
Your first client...... had an idea of women that most of us do not share
Homage to the rear temple...... is more fervent than the other
I put this question to the company
How can we determine the true inclination of a boy or girl?
Their best part, in other words
I believe by masturbation of the requisite body areas
Let' s take the youngsters about whom we have doubts...... and take them aside to verify
Observing, with equal passion and apathy, Guido and Vaccari...... masturbating the two bodies which belong to us...... inspires a number of interesting reflections
Would you care to elaborate, dear Duke?
We Fascists are the only true anarchists
Naturally...... once we' ve become masters of the state, true anarchy is that of power
However, look at their obscene gestures...... like deaf- mute language...... with a code none of us can break, no matter how great our power
There is nothing to be done
We must restrict our impulses to a single gesture
He came.
Now he is a man
Little Sergio, we' re proud of you
- She' s a woman now - Our first couple has been formed
Sergio, you' ve proved you' re a man
She is your prize
Come forward
Appreciate the goodwill of these gentlemen...... who allow you to enjoy such a great privilege...... we will solemnize your marriage
What a fine thing
What a whore
Get out, you sluts!
Let us resume the ceremony
Will you, Sergio...... take Renata for your wife?
I pronounce you man and wife
Clear off, all of you!
If you salute him, then you are bound
If you are for him, if you are sound
Then you must join up, honour bound
Lustily!
Aren' t you newlyweds?
Give rein to your feelings
Get busy, idiot
No!
That flower is reserved for us
The principle of all greatness on earth...... has long been bathed in blood
My friends, if memory does not betray me:
"Without bloodshed, there is no forgiveness
Baudelaire
Excellency, the expression is not to be found in Baudelaire...... but in Nietzsche' s The Genealogy of Morals
It is neither from Baudelaire nor Nietzsche...... nor in Saint Paul' s Epistle to the Romans
It' s Dada
Sing me that sweet melody I loved so much, that goes da- da
Delicious creature, do you want my dirty underpants?
My old underpants.
What incomparable refinement
You see how sensitive I am to the value of things
Little angel, my greatest desire is to grant your wish
You know I respect all tastes and whims
However baroque, all deserve to be respected
Because we' re not their masters, even the most bizarre manias...... derive from a basic principle of refinement
Yes, old buggers, it' s a question of delicacy
One day Madam sent me to another libertine
He took me to a room with a splendid Chinese carpet
After making me undress, he ordered me on all fours, like an animal
Having stroked my head two or three times...... he said:
"I want to see if you' re as quick as my dogs"
He threw two chestnuts across the room...... saying:
"Good bitch, fetch!"
I thought it best to go along with the game
You have two beautiful eyes... then look
Piss
"Filthy muck, putrid bitch", he shouted, approaching me
Then he ejaculated over my back
Then he left
I dressed...... and discovered 25, 000 lire in my coat
Eat!
Your Excellency, are you convinced?
It is when I see others degraded that I rejoice...... knowing it is better to be me than the scum of "the people"
Whenever men are equal, without that difference, happiness cannot exist
So you wouldn' t aid the humble, the unhappy
In all the world...... no voluptuousness flatters the senses more than social privilege
My next story is about the mania of Minister Missiroli
I went to the Minister' s office at ten one morning
The moment I entered, the doors closed
"What are you doing here, you little bitch?
"Who gave you permission to disturb me?"
I hadn' t been warned of what would happen...... so I was frightened by the welcome
I can' t take any more
He tore off my clothes, shredded them...... and threw them into the fire
Then he stretched out seemingly semi- conscious...... in a chair...... and ejaculated...... making his sperm fall upon the charred remains of my clothes
ClRCLE OF SHlT
Don' t you think, Signora Maggi...... that before your stories, you should show us your best part?
With the greatest of pleasure
These buttocks merit our attention
I have seldom seen better
Very kind of you to say so
We thank you.
Please begin
I see that you gentlemen esteem the rear end...... so I shall devote my stories to this subject
My story will interest you all...... especially our dear President; it concerns a particular mania...... his dearest caprice, which enabled me to make his acquaintance
Conceal my turpitudes from these innocents
Enough.
I am eager to hear Signora Maggi' s voice
My childhood years were spent in endowing my body with the capacity...... to satisfy the basest, most outrageous desires
I soon became expert in that difficult task...... and my fame spread throughout ltaly
My clients included many celebrities...... and to them I gave the best of myself
My first story concerns a most curious episode in my life
Signora Evola, the Madam I worked for...... sent me to a client after feeding me a large laxative- spiced meal
The client was an old Carabinieri General
He made me undress him and put a nappy on him
I was used to such fixations, I was ready to help him
Suddenly, my bowels rebelled and he ordered me to relieve myself...... which I did without embarrassment
He made me dip my fingers in the excrement...... and feed it to him like a baby
He swallowed everything, imitating the cries of a baby...... and ejaculated into his nappy
I knew a man capable of quite diverse refinements of the sort
We expect only the best tales of you
My next story took place in Verona
I was told that the client waiting at a hotel...... was an old nobleman, notorious for his depravity
My curiosity was immense
That evening my mother was more intolerant than usual
She pleaded with me not to go
I couldn' t resist the temptation, so I killed her
The only thing to do
The excitement awaiting you was supreme...... meriting the utmost sacrifice
It' s folly to say one owes anything to one' s mother
Must we be grateful for her having pleasure with a man?
That should have been enough reward for her
Long ago, I was cursed with a mother...... who aroused the same feelings you felt for yours
As soon as I could, I sent her to the next world
It was a profound pleasure when she closed her eyes for the last time
Why is that child crying?
Your words remind her of her mother
Her mother died trying to protect her
Splendid!
It' s your mother you' re crying for?
Come here, let me console you
Come back to Papa' s arms
He' il sing you another lullaby
What an opportunity you offer me
Signora Maggi' s story merits immediate re- enactment
I beg you to have mercy on my suffering
My mother died for me and I' il never see her again
Undress her immediately
Kill me!
God will take pity on me!
Don' t dishonour me!
This howling is the most exciting thing I' ve ever heard
Kill me!
Free me from this torment, seeing and hearing such horrors!
You all heard her call on God
Your Excellency, enter her name in the Penal Register...... for a terrible punishment
Do away with me, so that I can be with my mother
You will be punished and deflowered when we decide the time is ripe
Don' t think your tears restrain my desire; they make me more ruthless
Come here, my child, it' s ready
On your knees!
Go on!
Eat it
That stupid girl' s making a scene over such a delicacy
A friend insisted that all the excrement he ate every day...... come from a beggar woman, so it would be more putrid and delicious
I found an old woman of seventy for him
Spoiled food can provoke excellent diarrhoea
The subject should eat hastily, at odd hours, to overload the stomach
We must try that at once
Dear President
I am eager to know how you first met Signora Maggi
She will tell you after His Honour has married his Sergio
Then you' il laugh at my expense
I won' t deprive you of that pleasure
Today' s story demands a revision of our rules
If we wish to enjoy the fruit...... of our stay within these walls...... let us revise some of our rules
For example, we put containers in the latrines to collect all excrement...... so that nothing goes to waste
Let' s follow Signora Maggi' s example, giving our dear President...... the joy of seeing his dream come true
Good day, Signora Castelli
I' m sorry, we' il be ready in a moment
I' ve come to make sure
The chamberpots, quick!
You know the rules!
Tell me your name!
I couldn' t help it, with the muck we' re given to eat
Your name?
It' s Doris, the most undisciplined of our girls
She will be company for those already listed here
- Whose is this?
- Mine.
Help yourself
Is that how you obey our rules, impertinent brat?
Show me this boy' s arse
You even dared to wipe yourself.
You' il get what you deserve
We' re ready...... but preparing this one meant that I couldn' t watch these rogues
Unless the German people fall...... we are prepared for any eventuality...... to save a human soul, even in this part of Africa
We are happy to carry out your every command
Those I considered the most capable...... were fed appropriately
Thus as this solemn wedding feast we shall enjoy the greatest delicacy
Our girls abstained from relieving themselves all day...... in compliance with your decree...... that we produce this for you
Let the rite begin
Our guide restored the divine character of monstrosity...... thanks to reiterated actions, that is to say: rites
No more intoxicating desire exists...... endowing you with the vigour...... to meet the challenge awaiting you
Eat, my exquisite bride
You must prepare for our night of love
Nothing' s worse than a breath without odour
I can' t do it
Offer it to the Madonna
Do this
Say:
"I can' t eat rice with my fingers like this"
Then eat shit
I refer, as you will have guessed...... to our illustrious President
After having satisfied him...... I was impressed by such special tastes in one so young
Tastes that will become clearer later
Liberated from my mother...... I found life rich in all its delights
One day Madam presented me to the libertine in question
His passion will strike you as somewhat unusual
The scene took place in his house.
I was shown into a darkened room
I saw a man lying on the bed...... and a coffin in the middle of the room
"... but he doesn' t want to close his eyes...
"I adore the behind
"Although I am dying, I wish to die kissing one
"... wrap me in my shroud and close the coffin lid
"I insist that you observe my orders to the letter
"In this supreme moment with the sole object of my lewd desire
"Come quickly!"
He went on, his voice broken, sobbing
"Hurry!
I am at death' s door "
So I went to him and showed him my backside
"Oh, what a marvellous arse
"Having seen this, my life can end.
I' ve never seen one as alluring "
He fondled it, opened it
He played with it, kissed it, just as would the healthiest of men
He made me relieve myself of all that was in my bowels
I was not at all embarrassed
"Now it is the time for me to die.
The supreme moment has come "
As he said that, he gave a profound sigh
Piss over me
I can' t, it won' t come
I' ve finished
The limitation of love is that you need an accomplice
Your friend will know the libertine' s refinement...... is being executioner and victim
My sister knew an official in the Controller' s office
A little pig- like man, with a disgusting face
A chamberpot was arranged...... for two to sit on, back to back, and relieve themselves simultaneously
He stirred it with his fingers, and swallowed it
My sister told me...... he' d only to see her dirty arse and he ejaculated
Did your sister have a pretty backside?
You must judge by this.
A famous painter...... was commissioned to paint a Venus with a splendid backside
He selected her as his model after many weeks...... looking at hundreds of behinds throughout ltaly
How old was she then?
Fifteen, Duke
Why don' t you arrange a competition to find the nicest bottom here?
I' m an expert
Your Excellency, doesn' t this situation suggest anything to you?
It might
- Aren' t you ready?
- Just a moment
The act of the sodomite signifies the death of the human species
Ambiguously accepting social standards while transgressing them
More monstrous than the act of the sodomite...... is the act of the executioner
True, but the act of the sodomite can be repeated again and again
I think there is a way to repeat the act of the executioner
Turn off the lights
Here is my masterpiece
I have a proposal to make
We have not yet decided on the winner' s prize...... for the best bottom
Here is my proposal
He or she whose bottom is judged the best...... will be killed immediately
Agreed
This way we' il be impartial, not knowing whose bottom we are viewing
- A shrewd observation - Thank you, Your Excellency
For if we knew we were looking at a boy rather than a girl...... we might be influenced in making our decision
We must be completely free in our choice
A clever trap I wish to avoid
When one prefers men, it is difficult to change one' s perspective
The difference between a boy and a girl is enormous
One cannot consider what is obviously inferior
But if we consider all the stories we have heard...... in certain cases a girl might be preferable to a boy
Let us try to remain objective
Look at the elasticity of those buttocks
There can be no question here
Allow me, Duke
I don' t wish to contradict, but may I re- examine a most impressive one?
We' il be delighted to grant your request
I don' t think the heaviness of these buttocks...... can be compared to the most beautiful we have here
However, I will yield to the opinion of the majority
I vote for the Duke' s candidate
My vote goes to the Duke' s candidate
Dear President, three votes to one
I bow to the majority
But I request that my candidate be reserved for me to deflower
Granted
We' il reveal this mystery
Fire!
You must be stupid to think that death would be so easy
Don' t you know we intend to kill you a thousand times?
To the end of eternity, if eternity can have an end
Once I had a very mysterious client
His mania was closely related to...... the subject of Signora Castelli' s stories, for which I apologize
The man wanted only women...... who had been condemned to death
The closer they were to death, the more he would pay
He would visit them when the sentence had been pronounced
Thanks to his exalted social status, enabling him to pay the price...... not a single one escaped him
He did not possess them casually
He insisted on inspecting their rumps and that they defecated before him
He was convinced that the tastiest faeces...... were those of women who had just heard the sentence of death
ClRCLE OF BLOOD
Your Reverence, I am ready
We want a marvellous wedding
The President wishes to be first, he is the most randy
You whoresons!
What is this, a mortuary?
These parasites do nothing for this festive day
Do anything you like.
Laugh, all of you
Go on, idiots, show how happy you are
Go on, laugh
Why aren' t you yelling forjoy?
Go on, sing!
You two, what are you doing?
Excellency, note their names
If you like to whimper, we' il make you, for your last few days
Shouldn' t you have paid your bills, Monsieur Royale?
Of course, Monsieur Juju
Shouldn' t you also pay mine?
Why so?
Because two and two make four and I' m broke
Earn some money
- How do I do that?
- Through manual labour
I don' t know how
Then become an actor
That' s difficult
Try to write then; all you have to write...... is any old thing
Are you crazy?
I have a duty to perform; I' il return later
Your friend here is ready whenever you are
- Please, may I speak to you?
- Of course, my dear
What will you do to me?
Talk about that tomorrow; many things will be decided then
I know a secret.
Someone is violating your law
Graziella had a photograph under her pillow
Give me that photograph
Spare me and I' il tell you what Eva and Antoniska do
They' re breaking your laws
Don' t kill me.
I have secrets to tell you
Speak, dirty whore!
Every night Ezio goes to the black servant girl
I can take you there
Queers!
You make me puke
Those who are named will wear a sky blue ribbon
You can imagine what that means
They will return to Salo
What are you going to do to us?
You' il soon know the gravity of your crimes
The main character...... figured in a number of the previous stories
He is forty, very powerfully built...... with a member like a stallion
He is enormously rich, very powerful, very cruel
A heart of stone
He owns a house near Milan, which he uses exclusively for his pleasure
At his parties, at least fifteen young girls are present...... aged from fifteen to seventeen
Those who are chosen must present themsleves completely naked
He touches them, caresses them, examines them...... then makes them defecate into his mouth, but he does not swallow it
After these first rituals, with fearsome gravity...... he brands each girl on the shoulder...... burning a number into their tender flesh
After these preliminaries, he opens the window...... and places a girl standing in the middle of the room, facing the window
Then gives such a powerful kick to her behind...... that the poor thing flies across the room...... through the window and vanishes into a dark cellar
Our hero is familiar not only with Nietzsche, but Huysmans as well
In the cellar, a masked executioner with the devil' s emblems...... presides gravely over the horrible machines
When all the girls are in the cellar, our hero...
... is highly aroused, having so many contacts without once ejaculating
Naked, his huge member jutting from his belly
Now all the machines have begun to function...... all tortures at once, with terrifyingly loud screeching
The first apparatus is a huge wheel with razor blades...... to which is bound a girl to be flayed alive
Another has a live rat sewed inside her vagina
Oh Lord, why hast thou foresaken us?
A rationalperson...... is not content to kill the same person
He would recommend murdering as many as possible

It' s a quite a big deal for a pick up, isn' t it.
Where' s the other car?
We gotta wait for him.
Are you serious?
It' s not safe here.
We have specific orders from him.
Look, the roads could be blocked by now.
We gotta go! what' s the matter?
Shut up.
What the hell we doing here anyway?
An order is an order.
Stop whining.
Orders?
Do you know what we had to go through for this?
Besides, this place gives me the cr eeps.
Don' t bother.
These assholes will only follow orders.
What?
Is there any party?
Or you trying to promote hoodlums?
Better watch your mouth.

So shall I give you a rest?

Stop!
It' s an order.
Shut up!
I do not get the point why he is so special.
But you have to follow orders, too, right?
Both of you.
Back off.
Don' t be so choosy.
We gonna let you get out of here when he comes, all right?
I hate waiting.
Stop it for now.
Okay,
we' il wait for him.
We better hurry up.
I hate this place.

Just let her go.

Don' t let me tell you again.
This would be your last chance.
What now, tough guy?
Where did they go?
This place is wrong.
I' il kill him.
Better not.
He' il become a monster, too.
I don' t get it...
Oh Yes.
I can kill him twice.
Nonsense.
Let' s get out of here.
No, we' il go after them!
You don' t understand.
Look, this is your fault...
It' s not just that.
Thinking isn' t going to do a bit of good.
Nonsense.
They were not dead.
Let' s get them before he gets here.
Yeah, you' re right.
You didn' t have to kill him! what' s your problem?
You' re no different from those men.
They' re bastards, I' m not.
I' m sorry...
Thanks for helping me.
I didn' t mean to help you.
They just piss me off.
What are we gonna do?
Didn' t you have any plans?
Plans are always changed.
Great.
They' re going to kill us.
Surely dead.
Hey.
Why were you in jail...?
Shut up.
Something' s not right with this place.
About what?
People are everywhere... but it' s too quiet.
Nobody' s here.
I feel them.
What makes you feel that?
I have a strong sixth sense...
Hey,
wait.
what' s wrong with you?
Where the fuck you think you are going?
Stay back.
This man...
What are you doing?
Stop!
Let him rest in peace!
I don' t believe this...
You' re crazy.
Let' s go.
We' il take their car.
Stop it!
Let' s get out of here.
They must be around here.
Something' s wrong here.
I can feel it!
They were...
Something is wrong!
Hey...
What?
They were dead... and they came back to life.
So what?
The dead could be back to life here.
So what?
We always buried the ones we killed...
Dead bodies are everywhere...
Where the fuck are they?
No, I didn' t mean to...
Come!
Let go of me!
Game is over.
What are those monsters?
Who knows, they are your playmates.
Then you die, and play with me!
Remember your orders!
Don' t kill him!
Hey, you got wrong man.
Just let him go.
Don' t be a fool, punk.
Wow.
This is complicated.
Hey, she' s been taken away.
What?
That runt shot my arm and took the girl.
Jesus, the both of you!
You' re both crazy!
You turning back?
Well, I' il play with you later.
OK?
Good job shithead, now he' s gone.
Don' t you get it?
I let him find the girl for us.
Huh?
We' il get them both after he finds her.
Pretty smart...
Orders are to get both of them alive.
Oh... too bad.
It doesn' t matter anymore.
You...
I' il be in charge from now on and he will die.
What?
It' s all been planned.
He comes here to be killed.
Don' t fool with me!
What the fuck?
Die slowly.
W e don' t want you back alive.
Are you okay?
Yeah...
But this place is fucked up.
Nothing can stop me...
Not even those monsters.
Don' t worry.
Hurry up!
Bastards...
You okay?
Shit...
Your hand!
He took it...
That bastard!
Damn it!
W e' il make them pay for this.
Shouldn' t we report back?
No...
We' il search for them... and destroy them!
Y eah...
But where are they?

I' m an expert in profiling.
An expert?...
Expert, so where in the mountains?
Don' t worry.
I' il track them down.
I grew up in Yellow Stone National park, a natural born hunter!
A hunter?
Which way?
No!
Shut the fuck up!
What' s wrong here...
He' il come after us.
Let me go!
This is so insane.
You...
You did all this?
It' s all your fault!
Stop...
You' re crazy...
Hey.
No!
What?
You don' t have to kill him.
Shut up.
Don' t preach at me.
You can' t hurt people for no reason.
A lot of people are better dead.
That' s not for you to judge.
What are you?
A preacher?
Let' s go.
Look, no more killing, okay!
We' ve been waiting.
This is going to end soon.
My gun.
Who are you?
How did you get here?
I was kidnapped...
What?
I can' t remember.
I can' t remember anything what happened before I got here.
Yeah, right.
How about you?
What got you in prison?
I was...
What?
You don' t remember either?
I forget things easily.
You too.
When did you get here?
Now.
What' s going on?
What are those monsters... those two weirdos?
What are you up to?
Something bad.
Where are others?
Where?
They' re all dead.
and why are you alive?
Gotta problem?
Y eah.
You.
A scumbag like you should be dead.
Oooh, who are these scary people?
You' re dead.
No, let' s get away from here.
That was pretty good.
But not good enough...
Hey, babe.
What are you?
You' il need an army to kill me.
You.
I' il give you power...
in death.
Him!
No, we have to go!
No, not him!
Let' s go!
Now!
Hurts?
Human life is only an instant.
Your body will eventually rot.
Do you wanna be dead?
or wanna have eternal life?
Eternal...
Any trouble?
Y es, a little accident.
Are you okay officer?
Don' t call me officer.
Did you do it again?
You better behave yourself, officer...
You want to fight me, the master of all martial arts?
The Fighter!
Okay, Fighter.
Fighter?
We don' t hav e time.
Let' s kill them!
Right, Fighter.
Your heart!
Here.
Help yourself.
What?
Mother fucker!!!
I' il show you the world beyond death...
Come on.
Let' s go.
Why?
We have to hurry.
No.
I never turn my back.
We don' t have time for this.
That man is dangerous...
Who is he?
You know him.
He' s...
That' s enough.
Who is he?
- We got to get back.
- See ya, Matt.
Come through here.
Strip down.
Open up.
Welcome to Alcatraz.
Count 'em!
- 25 on inside C, first tier.
- 20 inside B, first tier.
- 23 on inside C, second tier.
- 17 inside B, second tier.
Break out!
Inside B and C.
Move!
Better button your coIlar, boy.
No forks.
Hey, no forks.
Do you see any?
Fresh fish, you want your pasta?
Hey, you want your pasta?
Do you see any?
I see pasta in my sleep.
I' m Litmus.
Like Iitmus paper.
When it' s cold, my face gets blue.
When it' s hot, my face gets red.
Inside C, move out.
Warden wants to see you.
Name?
Morris.
That' s funny.
This file says Frank Lee Morris.
If you disobey the rules of society, they send you to prison.
If you disobey the rules of prison, they send you to us.
Alcatraz is not Iike any other prison in the United States.
Here, every inmate is confined alone to an individuaI ceIl.
Unlike my predecessors, wardens Johnson and BlackweIl,
I don' t have good conduct programs.
I do not have inmate councils.
Inmates have no say in what they do.
They do as they' re told.
You are not permitted to have newspapers or magazines carrying news.
Knowledge of the outside world is what we teII you.
From this day on, your world wiII be everything that happens in this building.
You wiII shave once a day.
You wiII shower twice a week.
You wiII cut your hair once a month.
You can talk.
You can work.
Other institutions hand out work, but here it' s a privilege that you earn.
I promise you it' s a privilege that you' II want.
Visitors - you' re aIlowed two a month.
They cannot be former inmates of this or any other federaI prison.
AII names that you submit wiII be carefuIly checked by the FBl.
What names do you have in mind?
I can' t think of any offhand.
Family members?
No family.
Alcatraz is a maximum security prison with very few privileges.
We don' t make good citizens, but we make good prisoners.
Burglary, armed robbery, grand Iarceny...
You' ve escaped from quite a few prisons, haven' t you?
That' s why you' re here.
Alcatraz was built to keep aII the rotten eggs in one basket, and I was speciaIly chosen to ensure that the stink from the basket does not escape.
Since I' ve been warden some have tried to escape.
Most have been recaptured.
Those who haven' t have been kiIled or drowned in the bay.
No one has ever escaped from Alcatraz.
And no one ever wiIl.
Sure.
Even to bed together.
And when I wash, he washes.
That way we sleep nice- nice together.
Capisce?
I' m Wolf.
Where did they transfer you from?
Atlanta.
Nice town, Atlanta.
I never saw it.
I' m Iooking for a... new punk.
Good Iuck.
You don' t understand.
I just found her.
Why don' t you show her what you can do?
(Guard) Morris, I need somebody in the Iibrary.
- Take him over there, wiII you?
- Yes, Captain.
What you want, boy?
The buII sent me down here to work.
Can you read... boy?
As Iong as it' s in the English Ianguage, boy.
You treat them aII Iike Wolf?
I didn' t.
You' II take that cart to the ceIls.
Don' t they Iet cons down here?
You see any chairs?
How come?
Because this is The Rock, man.
They don' t want you doing anything here... but time... hard friggin 'time.
Rock affects dudes differently.
It either brings out your strength, or it breaks you.
What did it do for you?
What happens when you get out?
I won' t.
10 years ago...
I was in this bar in Alabama when two dudes started hassling me.
That was their first mistake.
They puIled knives.
That was their second mistake.
They didn' t know how to use them.
That was the Iast mistake they ever made.
I got two 99- year sentences back- to- back.
Seems Iike you could have pleaded self- defence.
The dudes were white, man, just Iike you.
When I arrived they put me in one of those dark ceIls in D- block.
After a while, I went stir crazy.
Sliced my AchiIles' tendon to get out.
You' II see why when you see D- block.
TeII me something, you through kiIling white guys?
- Why?
I just figured I wouldn' t turn my back on you.
Hey.
What' s your name, man?
Frank.
What' s yours?
English.
See you Iater.
- Your name?
- Morris.
OK.
- Magazine or book?
- Where' s English?
What did they do, give a nigger a nigger of his own?
Magazine?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Magazine?
Thanks.
- Hey, you' re new.
Hey, wait, wait a minute.
I haven' t seen a new guy in six months.
It' s nice to talk.
How are the Brooklyn Dodgers doing?
- Moved to LA two years ago.
- No kidding?
Warden don' t aIlow no books in these ceIls.
How come?
Because there' s no Iight in them.
Better deliver them books, Morris, where they can be read.
Right.
What' s the flower?
That' s something inside me they can' t Iock up with their bars and waIls.
I' m Doc.
- No.
- Why not?
You scared of dying?
I don' t think so.
You better be.
You hurt Wolf.
Wolf' s going to hurt you.
Where you going, cracker?
Pete.
Something speciaI about those steps?
The higher you sit, the more status you got.
So we play king of the mountain, except here we don' t play for fun, man.
And you' re king?
Yeah.
Now, I figure there' s two reasons why you didn' t sit down on my step.
Either you' re too scared, or you just hate niggers.
Now, which is it, boy?
You too scared?
I just hate niggers.
So no one' s ever busted out.
No one' s ever made it.
Everyone has Iooked for a way, but there ain' t any.
See those hacks?
Most joints have one hack for every seven cons.
There' s one hack for every three cons here.
You start shitting at night instead of in the morning, they ask why.
Let' s say you' re going to try it anyway.
First, you' ve got to get out of the ceIl.
Each bar has six hard smaIler bars set in a steeI tube with extra steeI poured in.
And there ain' t no way to tunneI out, either.
Shit.
This island is solid rock.
See that water?
It' s over a mile swim to Iand.
The currents make it seem Iike 10.
And the water' s so cold it wiII numb your arms in minutes.
Even if you are a good swimmer, you won' t have time to make it.
There are 12 counts every day.
Sometimes I think that' s aII this shit hole is, one Iong count.
We count the hours, the buIls count us, and the king buIls count the counts.
(Whistle blows) (Guard) Inside!
Everybody in!
I' m assigning you a permanent job... the carpentry shop.
It' s a paying job.
- How much?
- 15 cents an hour.
WeIl, I always knew crime would pay.
It' s a job.
See you Iater.
I sleep Iousy, but I sniff the glue.
It helps pass the nights.
Aren' t you afraid they' II shake down your ceIl?
Then I go to the hole.
It' s worth the chance.
I guess anything you want bad enough is worth the chance.
Including busting out?
Hey, maybe there' s a way out.
It' s on top of your head.
The ventilator shafts on top of our block.
How do you get on top of the block?
- Ask the buII for the key.
- Thanks.
Hey, jive dude, where you going?
Summer' s coming on.
It' s getting cooler.
Maybe crazier.
Mark Twain wrote that the coldest winter he ever spent was summer in San Francisco.
I can...
Wolf' s coming at you.
- Is his hand cupped?
- Yes.
- Which one?
- His right.
Break off!
Drop it, Wolf!
(Guard) Drop it, Wolf.
You Iike D- block, Wolf?
You better, because you' re gonna rot there for a Iong time.
D- block, Morris.
Look, he came at me.
I said D- block.
- When I get out, you' re dead.
- You' II be dead before you get out.
Warden don' t Iike inmates fighting.
Don' t Iike 'em stinking up their ceIls, either.
Lights out!
Go on back to your ceIl.
(Guard) Welcome to Alcatraz.
- Hey, is anybody over there?
- Yeah, me.
- Come out in front and say heIlo.
- I' m busy.
(Toilet flushes)
Don' t worry.
I washed it.
How you doing, neighbour?
I' m Charley Butts.
SmaIlest ceII I ever seen.
- You' II get used to it.
- I don' t think so.
- I don' t Iike Iiving alone in here.
- You' II get used to that, too.
(BeII rings) (Guard) Break out!
Yard time!
Button the coIlar.
Who' s the new fish?
I got him next to me.
- What' s your name?
- Charley Butts.
Charley' s butt?
Butts.
Butts!
Charley Butts.
You got a funny name, kid.
What' s your name?
- AI Capone.
- Aren' t you dead?
I got too much money.
I' II never die.
- You play poker?
- Not much.
I just Iearned myself.
We' II play tomorrow.
See you Iater, kid.
See you Iater, Al.
I don' t believe I just met AI Capone.
I don' t, either.
- I' m Doc.
- Charley Butts.
How' s the painting going, Doc?
It' s nearly finished.
- You painting the warden?
- He' s very inspiring.
Inside.
Everybody in!
Yes, sir?
I want painting privileges taken away from Chester Dalton.
- Doc?
- CeII 233.
What' s the reason?
You' re deputy warden.
You think of one.
When do you want the suspension to begin?
It' s an elimination.
Right away.
Yes, sir.
Painting privileges have been removed.
Why?
I don' t know.
Painting' s aII I have.
I' m sorry, Doc.
You OK, Doc?
I think there' s something wrong with him.
I' d keep my eye on Doc.
He seems pretty upset.
Cons are always upset about something.
Put your overaIls on.
Mr Zimmerman, I' m making a new table.
I need a hatchet.
Bob, get Doc a hatchet.
Mr Zimmerman!
Can you come over here for a minute?
Get him out!
Take him out of here!
Get him out!
Get back to work.
Move!
Everybody, back to work!
Let' s go!
Here.
Put that in your report.
What were you doing back there, boy?
Why not?
What do you want?
I got Boys Life.
I know some queens who fight over it every month.
Just give me what you got on top there.
I heard about Doc... and I know why he did it.
Somebody took away his painting privileges.
Who?
The warden.
(Warden) Morris.
I hear there was an accident in the shop.
Accident?
Oh, you mean Doc.
Someone didn' t Iike what he was painting, so someone won' t Iet him paint.
Someone should have warned Doc to be carefuI what he paints.
I think you' re absolutely right, sir.
- Isn' t there?
- We have to be careful.
Back in Iine.
Hey, how' s it going, Frank?
If it isn' t the Anglins.
What are you guys doing, just dropping by?
Thought we' d pay you a visit.
Gonna stay Iong?
Only about 15 or 20 years.
Why The Rock?
We were Ieaving Atlanta when we encountered a minor problem.
- Such as?
- They saw us.
Yeah, that do present a problem.
They shipped us to Leavenworth.
But we didn' t Iike their accommodations, either.
Warden said he knew just the place for us... Alcatraz.
- Is it true no one' s ever escaped?
- So they teII me.
Jesus.
Wonder what I' d be Iike after 15 years here.
You stiII reading that Bible?
It' s opening up aII kinds of new doors.
I turned 35 today.
Some birthday.
I don' t know.
Jeez, what kind of childhood did you have?
Short.
I always wanted to see San Francisco.
Never thought it' d be Iike this.
What' d you get sent to The Rock for?
Couple of years ago I started stealing cars, for kicks mostly.
Got sent to the state pen.
You end up in Alcatraz for that?
Not exactly.
A buII there Iiked to push me around.
So when I got out, I went back, and stole his car.
Unfortunately, I drove it across the state Iine, which made it a federaI rap, and I was sent to The Rock.
(Guard) English!
Visitor for you.
Butts, you got a visitor.
- Me?
- Yeah, you.
Probably somebody wants their car back.
HeIlo, Father.
- Why didn' t you say you were coming?
- I was afraid you wouldn' t Iet me.
It' s just hard to see you Iike this.
Your mama' s going to die.
Charley?
When?
WeIl, she' s got a few months.
'Can you caII her?'
We' re not aIlowed to make phone caIls.
You cannot discuss Institution rules.
Stick to your personaI Iife.
This is my personaI Iife!
You getting a kick out of it?
- (Click) - HeIlo?
HeIlo!
I love you, Charley.
Hey, Frank.
Yeah?
If you try to get out, I want in.
Must be Wednesday.
Why?
Mystery mounds.
We always have mystery mounds on Wednesday.
I can' t taste it.
I just eat it out of habit.
What' s the movie this weekend?
Oh, some cowboy piece of shit.
(Imitating gangster) Hey, at Ieast they could show us a gangsta movie.
I may have found a way out of here.
You Iooking at something?
The way I figure it, this ceII block' s reaIly getting old.
The moist air corrodes the concrete.
The salt is rusting the metal.
I took a naiI clipper and dug around the griIle at the back of the ceIl.
I can dig that griIle out, and enlarge the hole into the utility corridor to the top of the ceII block and onto the roof.
How wiII we hide the hole?
We tear the ads from magazines... no one wiII miss those... make cardboard, paint griIles on that, and put it in the hole, maybe partiaIly obscure it with a toweI or whatever.
I' ve ordered an accordion to put in front of my hole.
Now, children, are you sitting comfortably?
All that long, long time ago none of the things we can see now... the sun, the moon, the stars, the earth the animals and plants... not a single one existed
What a character he was.
I wonder whatever became of him?
Oh, I imagine he' s dead like all the rest.
Ah, those were the days.
Mr. Tuttle, your hair.
Yes?
Good morning, ma' am.
We' ve come about the...
Oh, yes, of course.
Come in.
I wasn' t expecting you so soon.
You are...?
I' m Bertha Mills, ma' am.
And this is Edmund Tuttle.
Pleased to meet you, ma' am.
That' s right.
The gardener.
And this young lady is called Lydia.
Have you had much experience in service?
Oh, don' t let that angel face fool you, ma' am.
Can you iron?
Has the cat got your tongue?
She can' t talk, ma' am.
The poor little mite' s a mute.
I can promise you that.
All right.
The other girl I had spoke too much, anyway.
Follow me.
Mrs. Mills, you and the girl... will sleep in the attic room at the top of the stairs.
Tuttle, ma' am.
You could sleep in the shed around the back.
As you can see, the housework has been rather neglected... since the servants disappeared almost a week ago.
You mean they just vanished?
Into thin air.
They didn' t even collect their wages.
They... they just Ieft us.
What a strange thing to do.
You' il soon find out there are times... when this house is not exactly an ideal home.
Hence my advertisement in the newspaper... requesting honest, hardworking people.
There' s nobody more honest or hardworking than us.
Isn' t that right, Mr. Tuttle?
And, um, very hardworking.
The kitchen.
I have breakfast at 8: 00... the children at 9: 00.
Lunch will be served at 1: 00 and dinner at 7: 30.
And the master, ma' am?
The master went off to war... a year and a half ago.
I' ve had no news since the war ended
Which of you does the cooking?
I' m so sorry, ma' am
Which of you does the cooking?
You' il notice what I' m doing.
In this house, no door must be opened... without the previous one being closed first.
It is vital that you remember this.
It' s not as easy as it may seem.
There are 1 5 different keys for all of the 50 doors... depending on which area of the house you' re in at the time.
I will be leaving a set of keys in your charge.
Yes, ma' am.
The music room.
That old piano was already here when we moved in.
It sets off my migraine.
Silence is something that we prize... very highly in this house.
That is why you will not find a telephone, a radio... or anything else that makes a racket.
During the war, the Germans kept cutting it off... so we learned to live without it.
Let' s continue.
Ma' am, there' s no need to show us the whole house.
Yes
Most of the time, you can hardly see your way.
It' s often difficult to make out... if there is a table, a chair, a door, a sideboard... or one of my children playing hide and seek.
What do you mean, ma' am?
Perhaps I should introduce you to the children.
You' il find tools in the shed.
Yes, ma' am.
AII of them.
Come.
You wait here.
Whatever you do, don' t open the curtains.
Wakey, wakey.
Eyes closed, hands together
Jesus, to whom now I pray
Blessed be the Virgin pure whom I greet with faith too short
Jesus, Mary, spotless rose keep us till this day doth close
They' re still half asleep.
What sweet little children.
Well... what do you say?
How do you do?
How do you do?
How do you do, children?
My name is Mrs. Mills... but you can call me Bertha if you like.
Anne.
Nicholas.
Anne and Nicholas.
What pretty names.
Are you going to be our new nanny?
I' m your new nanny.
It' s time for their breakfast.
Lydia, go to the kitchen and close every shutter.
The doctors were never able to find a cure.
For what?
Their condition.
The children have a very serious allergy to light.
They are photosensitive and must never be exposed... to any light much stronger than this.
Otherwise, in a matter of minutes... they will break out in sores and blisters... and begin to suffocate.
It would eventually be fatal.
Good heavens
Oh?
Why not?
It tastes funny.
I liked it better before.
That' s because before, somebody else made it.
When are they coming back?
They' re not coming back, child.
Just like Daddy.
Daddy is coming back, though.
Mrs Mills, our father' s fighting in a war in France
It' s the World War
I know, but he' s in France.
Finish up your breakfasts.
Are you going to leave us, too?
Of course not!
Why should I leave you?
The others said they wouldn' t... but they did, and then it happened.
Be quiet!
What happened?
Mummy went... mad.
Nothing happened.
No, it didn' t!
Yes, it did!
Be quiet
I want those plates empty... in less than a minute.
Is that clear?
I' d like a word with you.
Yes, ma' am.
But I just checked the letterbox... and this week he hasn' t.
I' m afraid I don' t follow, ma' am.
This letter should have been collected... and delivered to the newspaper five days ago.
It' s an advertisement for servants.
Since it was never published... would you explain what you' re doing here?
Oh, I understand.
Ma' am, that' s what I was going to say to you... when you opened the door to us.
The truth is that we just come by... on the off chance.
A big house like this... is always in need of someone who knows the ropes.
You' ve served in a house like this one before?
This may come as a surprise to you, ma' am, but we, in fact, used to work here.
Here?
Oh, now, It was a few years ago.
If you don' t mind my saying so, ma' am... they were the best years of my life.
That' s why we come by, because this house... means a lot to us.
No, no, no.
Don' t bother.
So you say you know the house well?
Like the back of my hand
That is assuming the walls haven' t sprouted legs... and moved in the meantime.
The only thing that moves here is the light
But it changes everything.
One might almost say... unbearable.
The only way of enduring it is by keeping a cool head.
Oh, yes, ma' am.
I don' t like fantasies.
Do you know what I mean?
I think so, ma' am.
My children sometimes have strange ideas.
But you mustn' t pay any attention to them.
Children will be children
Yes, of course, ma' am.
You can stay.
Thank you very much, ma' am.
It did happen.
"To make them change their minds." Full stop.
What do you find so amusing?
Well, what?
Those children were really stupid.
Why?
Because they said they only believed in Jesus... and then they got killed for it.
Well, yes
Inside I would have believed in him... but I wouldn' t have told the Romans that.
Is that what you think, too, Nicholas?
I see.
So you would have lied to the point of denying Christ.
But what would have happened afterwards?
When?
In the next life.
The one waiting for us after we die.
Ahh.
Where, Nicholas?
To the children' s limbo.
What is the children' s limbo, Anne?
One of the four Hells.
Which are?
Me!
No Let him answer Which are?
There' s the Hell where the damned go... then there' s Purgatory...
And the bosom of Abraham where the just go... and limbo where children go.
At the center of the earth.
Where it' s very, very hot.
That' s where children go who tell lies... but they don' t just go there for a few days.
Oh, no.
Forever.
Think about it.
Try to imagine the end of eternity.
Close your eyes and try to imagine it
Forever.
Pain... forever.
I' m getting dizzy.
Now do you understand why Justus and Pastor told the truth?
Open your readers at lesson six.
Can' t we play?
You most certainly cannot.
First you' re going to read the lesson... then you' re going to learn it by heart.
All of it?
Any more protests... and there' il be no playing at all today.
In fact, I think you can study in separate rooms.
No, no, no!
Yes, yes, yes!
But we get scared if we' re separated!
As if you weren' t used to this house by now.
What if we see a ghost?
Has your sister been telling you one of her stories?
I haven' t told him anything!
If you see a ghost you say "Hello"... and continue on studying.
Come to the music room.
Why me?
Now come on.
Take your book.
Nicholas, I want to see that lesson learned... in less than an hour.
What?
Give me a kiss. "
Anne, wait for me outside
You know I can' t.
Over there.
Mrs. Mills, close all the curtains.
My daughter is going to cross the living room.
Yes, ma' am.
All right, Anne.
Mummy can' t be with you all the time, hmm?
You must learn to be on your own.
Where' s your rosary?
I want you to squeeze it with all your might... say an Our Father, and your fear will go away.
It won' t.
Yes, it will.
Don' t you see that when you do that... the Lord is with you?
There' s no reason to be afraid.
"The family is usually made up of parents...
No
Mr Tuttle and the girl Lydia are all I' ve got and I' m all they' ve got
Was she born like that?
Beg your pardon, ma' am?
Was she born a mute?
No.
If you' il excuse me, I think I' II go... and see if Mr. Tuttle needs a hand.
Nicholas!
Nicholas, I' m coming!
What' s the matter?
Why were you crying?
I was reading.
Anne!
Anne!
Anne?
I haven' t learned it yet, Mummy.
Are you all right?
Why were you crying?
I wasn' t.
I just heard you a moment ago.
There' s no need to feel ashamed, darling.
If I' d been crying, I' d tell you.
So I imagined it, did I?
It was that boy.
What boy?
Victor.
Who' s Victor?
The boy that was here a moment ago.
I told him to let me study... but he wouldn' t stop crying.
I think he' s a spoiled brat.
Oh, did he, now?
And why was he crying?
Because he doesn' t like this house... but he has to live here.
His father' s a pianist?
Yes.
He isn' t, is he, Mummy?
So, you' ve spoken to his father as well?
No, only with Victor
I' ve just come from the hall.
There' s no one there.
They' re viewing the house.
That' il do, Anne!
Now why were you crying?
It was Victor!
So where is he now?
He went out through there!
Would you mind telling me how a boy... can get in and out of this room if it' s locked?
I thought I made myself quite clear
Is that so hard to understand?
This house is like a ship.
The light must be contained as if it were water... by opening and closing the doors.
My children' s lives are at stake!
But, ma' am...
Do not argue with me Be quiet
Which was the last of you to enter that room?
Lydia?
I already told you that.
That leaves you, then.
But I was in the hall the whole time.
And then I went out into the garden.
You saw me with your own eyes.
I hope you are not suggesting that it was me!
Do you think that I would overlook such a thing... and endanger the life of my own daughter?
You' re not supposed to read at the table.
Who' s going to tell Mummy?
Or perhaps you?
Did you really see a boy?
He' s called Victor.
Is he a ghost?
Ghosts aren' t like that.
What are they like?
They go about in white sheets and carry chains.
How do you know?
Because I' ve seen them.
They come out at night.
Fibber.
Where?
You' re stupid.
Not half as much as you.
I don' t believe you saw that boy.
Believe what you like.
You' il soon be begging us to play with you.
Huh?
What?
Look.
Why have you opened the curtains?
It wasn' t me.
Who was it, then?
It was Victor.
He' s been doing it all night.
You' re lying.
I' m going to tell Mummy.
So I' m a liar, am I?
Yes.
Victor, come out from behind that curtain... so my stupid brother can see you.
Leave me alone.
So you don' t want to see him now, eh?
Cowardy cowardy custard.
I' il just have to do it myself, then.
That' s enough, Victor
Nicholas.
He won' t listen to me.
Stop it Get off my bed, both of you
No, it' s mine
Anne, please stop putting on that voice.
You be quiet, cowardy custard.
Listen, if you don' t stop, I' il call my mother... and she' il kick you out.
You don' t know my mother.
And you don' t know my parents
Anne, I' m going to tell Mummy about you.
Don' t be stupid.
Can' t you see it' s not me?
Victor, touch his cheek so he knows you' re real.
Mummy!
Help!
What is it?
What is it?
She was fighting with me, and I told her to be quiet.
I am fed up with you!
I didn' t do anything!
"to till the ground from whence he was taken.
"cherubims and a flaming sword
There I finished
Very good.
Now you can ask the Virgin for forgiveness.
What?
That' s not what we agreed!
We didn' t agree anything, young lady.
Today you' re being punished, and you' il do as I say.
You can' t make me ask the Virgin for forgiveness.
How dare you!
Mummy, I won' t ask forgiveness for something I didn' t do!
You told your brother someone else was in the room!
There was!
I am not!
Anne... do you remember the story about Justus and Pastor?
Children who don' t tell the truth end up in limbo.
That' s what you say, but I read the other day... that limbo' s only for children who haven' t been baptized.
And I have!
And he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went, both of them together
And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father and said, 'My father' and he said, 'Here I am, my son "'
Did you look in on Nicholas?
Yes, ma' am.
The little angel is fast asleep.
What about Anne?
Is she still on the stairs?
Oh, yes, ma' am.
I' d prefer to have her where I can see her... but I can' t embroider in such poor light.
How long is this punishment going to go on?
It' s been three days now.
It' s up to her.
She' s got to learn to swallow her pride... and ask for forgiveness.
Anyway, it' s time she started to read the Bible.
The priest will be very pleased to hear that, ma' am.
If he ever deigns to pay us another visit
He knows perfectly well that the children can' t go out
He told me yesterday... he' d be by as soon as possible.
I' m beginning to feel totally cut off from the world.
It' s never lasted this long before
Oh, that' s true, ma' am.
Even the seagulls have gone quiet
Anne!
Incidentally, Mrs. Mills...
I' ve had to put up with the noise... of Lydia running around above my head.
She' s been hurtling backwards and forwards as if there were three of her
Would you kindly tell her it' s not necessary... to kick up quite such a rumpus... just to do a little cleaning?
I couldn 't bear to get another migraine attack
I' il tell her, ma' am.
Thank you
Now she' s really gone too far.
Lydia!
What' s going on up there?
I' m just reading.
Did you hear it as well?
"the second time and said...
What was that?
I don' t know.
Anne, tell me who' s making that noise.
I can' t tell you, Mummy.
You tell me.
I told you there was someone in the room... and you punished me.
Now I don' t know what to say.
Anne, I want the truth.
Tell me if there is someone upstairs.
In that junk room.
Mummy, you' re letting the light in
She' s a woman She' s what?
Where did they go?
They just came past here.
Didn' t you see them?
Which way did they go?
Over there, over there, and down there as well.
They say this house is theirs.
And they' re going to take the curtains down.
Ma' am, stay calm, please.
I will not stay calm!
For five whole years during the occupation...
I managed to avoid a single Nazi stepping foot in this house... and now there is someone here, opening and closing the doors.
Ma' am, this is a very old house.
The floorboards squeak and the plumbing clanks...
I' m telling you.
Mummy, look
Mummy, look!
I did it yesterday.
This is the father, this is the mother... this is Victor, and this is the old woman
What do these numbers stand for?
That' s the number of times I' ve seen them
I' ve seen the old woman the most
Oh, God in Heaven.
We have to search the whole house immediately... before it gets dark.
There, now.
It' s all right.
Nothing will happen to you while Mummy' s here.
Look, Mummy She really scares me
It' s as if she' s not looking at you but she can see you.
And she' s always around saying "Come with me"...
No, Anne, don' t lie to me.
Honestly, Mummy And she asks me things
What does she ask you?
Things.
Her breath smells.
We have to open all the curtains.
Yes, ma' am.
You both search the right side and I' il take the left
Then we' il search upstairs.
Perhaps they' re ghosts who lived in this house before
Ghosts go about in white sheets... and carry chains and go "Ooo."
Why do you make up such stories?
I read them in books.
Well, you shouldn' t believe everything... that you read in books.
She says all this stuff about ghosts is rubbish... and then she expects us... to believe everything written in the Bible.
And don' t you believe it?
I believe some things
And I don' t believe that Noah... got all those animals into one boat... or the Holy Spirit is a dove.
No, I don' t believe that, either.
Doves are anything but holy
They poo on our windows.
Have you mentioned any of this to your mother?
Yes?
They' ve searched everywhere, ma' am.
There' s no one.
I see
Mrs. Mills.
Yes, ma' am?
Do you have any idea what this might be?
No, but look.
They' re all asleep.
They' re dead.
It' s a book of the dead
In the last century, I believe they used to take photographs of the dead in the hopes that their souls would go on living through the portraits.
There are even group portraits.
And children!
Oh, it' s macabre!
How could these people be so superstitious?
Grief over the death of a loved one... can lead people to do the strangest things.
Get rid of it I don' t want it in the house
Yes, ma' am
Mrs. Mills, it' s cold.
Why don' t you come and sit by the fire?
Thank you very much, ma' am.
So... tell me about when you worked here before.
Did you have to look after children then?
No, I was in charge of organizing the housework.
Were there many servants?
Oh, about fifteen.
Though in the end... there were just the three of us left.
Why?
My employers moved to London.
They came here less and less... it being so out of the way like.
So gradually the house just became empty.
Everybody ends up leaving this damned island.
My family left in the summer of 1 940.... just before the invasion.
That was the last I' ve heard of them.
I don' t blame them.
Actually, we left, too
Although, you know... sometimes when you leave a place... it' s like it' s there with you all the time.
I always felt like I neverleft this house
Why did you leave?
Oh, it was on account of the tuberculosis.
The whole area was evacuated.
Was that when Lydia went dumb?
Yes, I think so... though my memory' s a bit rusty these days, ma' am.
What happened to her?
She just... stopped talking.
There must' ve been a reason.
People don' t just stop talking.
These things are always the result of some sort of trauma
Something must' ve happened to her.
Did your employers treat you well?
Oh, they were always very kind to us
They treated us just like family.
I' II never be able to get up in the morning.
Off you go
I' m going to stay here a while longer.
Yes, ma' am.
I' m sorry I was so hard on you.
Can you forgive me?
What?
When' s Daddy coming home?
When the war' s over.
Why did he go to war?
I mean, nobody' s done anything bad to us
Daddy went...
Why?
Charles... where are you?
Mrs Mills!
Mrs Mills!
What' s the matter, ma' am?
The key to the music room, give it to me!
What' s happening, ma' am?
Come on!
Oh, my God.
I checked that room myself.
It was empty.
Take these tablets, ma' am.
They' il do you good.
And yet I felt as if there was someone else there.
And it wasn' t human
Something diabolic
Ma' am...
Something which is not... not at rest.
You don' t believe it, do you?
I don' t blame you.
I used to not believe these things
I do believe it, ma' am.
I' ve always believed in those things.
They' re not easy to explain... but they do happen.
We' ve all heard stories of the beyond now and then... and I think sometimes the world of the dead... gets mixed up with the world of the living.
But it' s impossible.
The Lord would never allow such an aberration.
The living and the dead... will only meet at the end of eternity.
It says so in the Bible.
Ma' am... there isn' t always an answer for everything.
Where are you off to, ma' am?
I' m going to the village to pay Father McGraw a visit.
If he won' t come here, then I shall go to him.
I shall bring him back.
Ma' am, you should wait till the weather improves.
I don' t care what he told you!
I want him to tell me personally!
He must come today!
But what are you going to tell him?
That we have searched every room inch by inch... and now I need them to be blessed.
Still, it' s very early
Mr. Tuttle.
Morning, ma' am.
I need you to search the garden for gravestones.
Gravestones?
When my husband bought this house... we were told there was a little cemetery.
I think it was over there, amongst the trees.
I' ve not seen anything.
It could be overgrown.
I need to know if there was a family buried here... and if they had a little boy... Victor.
Now she thinks the house is haunted.
Do you think it' s safe to let her go?
The fog won' t Iet her get very far.
The fog, of course.
And when do you think... we should bring all this out into the open?
All in good time.
Speaking of which.
Charles?
Grace?
You' re here.
They said there was no hope.
They said I should give you up for dead.
They say a lot of things.
Thank you, God.
Every night I prayed for this... begging God to bring you back.
Bring him...
But where have you been all this time?
looking for my home.
You' re so different.
Sometimes I bleed.
Ma' am...
Mrs. Mills... this is my husband.
I' m very pleased to meet you, sir.
He' s very weak.
I want you to prepare a hot bath and some clean clothes.
And something to eat
Right away, ma' am.
How are my little ones?
Daddy!
Why did you take so long?
Hello, Nicholas.
I told you he' d come back
Have you both been well behaved?
We' ve been very good.
Have you been good to your mother?
Very good.
We study every day for our First Communion.
Daddy, did you kill anyone?
Here he comes!
Darling, we' ve prepared lunch for you.
Are you coming down or would you prefer...
When' s Daddy coming down?
Be patient, Anne Daddy is not well
Shh.
Mummy, when people die in the war... where do they go?
Oh, what a question.
It depends.
On what?
Whether they fought on the side of the goodies or the baddies.
Your father, for example, fought for England... on the side of the goodies.
How do you know who the goodies and the baddies are?
That' s enough questions.
Eat your food.
You' il never go to war.
We' il never go anywhere.
You' re not missing out on anything.
You' re much better off at home with your Mummy and Daddy... who love you very, very much.
And the intruders.
There are no intruders here.
But you said that there were.
I don' t want to hear another word on the subject.
That is enough!
Can I say something?
No!
Why not?
Because you can' t!
Anne, stop breathing like that.
You heard me Stop it
Stop breathing.
Right, you go to your room.
Go to your room.
Ohh, no crying now, no crying.
Oh, stop that here.
Look what an awful face you' ve got when you cry.
I don' t care!
There, there.
You listen to me.
I' ve seen them, too.
You have?
Yes.
Then maybe she' il believe me.
There are things your mother doesn' t want to hear.
She only believes in what she was taught.
But don' t worry, sooner or later... she' il see them.
Then everything will be different.
How?
Oh, you' il see.
There are going to be some big surprises.
Changes?
Now she' s behaving as if nothing had happened.
What about her daughter?
Oh, she' s not so stubborn.
The children will be easier to convince.
No, it' s the mother who' s going to cause us problems.
Do you think her husband suspects anything?
I don' t think he even knows where he is.
Ohh, look what a pretty daughter I' ve got.
Mummy made this veil especially for you.
Yes.
You do.
I need to shorten the sleeves a little.
You can take it off now.
No.
This dress has to be spotless for your First Communion.
I promise I won' t dirty it.
Just let me wear it for a little longer.
Oh, just a little?
I' il be back shortly.
No sitting on the floor or leaning against the walls.
I' d love to.
Charles, you can' t go on like this.
Anne, you need to take the dress off now.
Anne, are you listening to me?
Anne?
What did I tell you about sitting on the floor?
But it' s clean.
It makes no difference.
Why can' t you ever do as you' re told...
What' s the matter?
Where is my daughter?
What have you done with my daughter?
Are you mad?
I am your daughter.
You' re not my daughter!
You' re not my daughter!
Ma' am, I heard shouts.
She wants to kill me!
She won' t stop!
You' re wicked!
You' re wicked!
Wicked!
How is she?
There' s no calming her... so I' ve left her with her father.
She insisted on speaking with him
What happened?
Why did you fight?
She was imitating my daughter' s voice.
I' d swear to God that it wasn' t my daughter
God help me.
What' s the matter with me?
I don' t know what' s the matter with me.
You must get more rest.
You can' t take on the whole responsibility of this house.
We know what has to be done.
What do you mean by that?
What do you mean you know what has to be done?
Nothing, ma' am.
I was just suggesting...
There' s nothing to suggest.
You have no idea what has to be done.
Or do you?
What are these?
The tablets for your migraine, ma' am.
The ones you always take.
Please, I need to be on my own.
Yes, ma' am.
Come, child.
Anne told me everything
I wish I had an explanation, but I haven' t.
At first, I thought there was someone else in the house.
Even thought there were ghosts.
I' m talking about what happened that day.
I don' t know what you' re talking about.
Tell me it' s not true
Tell me what happened
Happened?
I don' t know what came over me that day.
Hadn' t the courage to tell me to my face.
They knew that I couldn' t leave the house.
They knew.
Anne, what happened?
She hit me.
She went mad like she did that day.
Do you remember?
No.
You must forgive me, Charles.
The children.
They know that I love them.
They know I' d never hurt them.
I' d die first.
What are you going to do?
Are you angry with me?
I just came back to say goodbye... to my wife and children.
Now I must go.
Go where?
To the front.
The war' s over.
The war is not over.
What are you talking about?
You' re not going, do you hear me?
You can' t go!
Why did you have to go to that stupid war... that had nothing to do with us?
Why couldn' t you have stayed here like the others?
The others surrendered.
We all surrendered!
The whole island was occupied!
What did you expect?
What were you trying to prove by going to war?
With your family.
That was enough for me
Living in this darkness
In this prison
But not for you
That' s why you left
It wasn' t just the war.
You want to leave me, don' t you?
Anne!
Nicholas!
Oh, my God!
Where are the curtains?
Mrs Mills!
Let me see.
You' re all right!
I want my daddy!
Daddy' s gone.
It' s not true!
Yes, it is.
I love you, Mummy.
Find the curtains.
Who was it?
Who did this?
Tell me!
You know because it happened to you, too!
You' il tell me.
You write it down.
Write it down!
Please!
That attitude won' t solve anything, ma' am
Anyway, she can' t write.
Where are they?
What?
The curtains!
The curtains my children' s lives depend on!
Someone has taken the curtains!
There' s no need for you to raise your voice.
I was just on the point of calling you.
Did you know that someone has taken all the curtains?
The curtains?
Oh, dear.
Why should anyone want to take all the curtains?
To let some daylight into this house, I imagine.
Of course.
Someone wants to kill my children.
Why do you think that the daylight would kill them?
Are you mad?
I told you.
The children are photosensitive!
The light will kill them!
Yes, but that was before.
The condition could have cleared up by itself.
If you never expose them to daylight how do you know they' re not cured?
My sister in law had terrible attacks of rheumatism... in her legs and back.
Then one fine day... they disappeared.
I am going to find those curtains... and when you have finished helping me hang them... you will leave this house!
What has he got to say about all of this?
Give me your keys.
I want your keys now!
You want to frighten us.
You' ve wanted to take over this house... ever since the first day you arrived.
Now, you give me those keys.
I will not ask again.
You should try and calm down, ma' am.
Give me the keys.
Give them to me.
And now get out of here.
You know something, Mr. Tuttle?
I think I' ve reached the end of my tether.
What about you?
Definitely.
We' d better go and uncover the gravestones.
What' s Mummy doing?
She' s gone mad.
Liar.
She' s gone mad!
Nighttime.
Where are you going?
I' ve had enough.
I' m going into the woods to look for Daddy.
Are you going to run away?
I can climb down to the ground.
It' s very easy.
If Mummy finds out, you' re in for it.
Yes, yes, yes.
Anne, wait!
I want to come and look for Daddy, too.
Liar.
You just don' t want to be left on your own.
Be quiet!
Anne, I think we got lost.
We still haven' t left the garden yet, silly.
I' m scared.
Shouldn' t have come, then.
Say something.
What shall I say?
Anything.
I' m walking and my name is Anne.
What' s that over there?
I think they' re graves.
Don' t go near!
Why not?
What if a ghost jumps out?
Only skeletons.
There' s something written here.
Let' s go!
Wait!
What does it say?
You must be strong now, children
Nicholas, come here!
Mrs. Mills, please don' t tell Mummy we' ve run away.
Don' t speak to them!
Why?
They' re dead!
What?
Please come here!
Children!
Why aren' t they wearing sheets and clanking chains?
You said that...
I don' t care what I said!
Get away from them!
You' re always teasing me and telling lies... and I' m sick of it!
I' m telling the truth!
Come here!
Children!
Run!
Don' t come any closer!
Don' t move!
Don' t trouble yourself, ma' am
Tuberculosis finished us off... more than half a century ago.
Go away!
Open the door, ma' am Please
What do you want?
Mummy, don' t open the door.
We' ve seen their graves.
Go upstairs and hide.
I' m scared.
Don' t separate!
Whatever you do, don' t separate.
Go hide.
We' ve been trying to make you understand
Understand what?
About the new situation.
What situation?
We must all learn to live together... the living and the dead.
If you' re dead, leave us in peace!
Leave us in peace!
In here.
Get inside.
Do you think they will?
Who?
The intruders.
There are no intruders.
They took the curtains down
Oh, yes, I assure you it was them
And now they' re in there with you and the children.
No!
Yes And believe me, sooner or later they' il find you.
No, no, no.
Mummy said we shouldn' t separate.
We can' t leave her on her own.
Stop breathing like that.
Nicholas, stop breathing like that.
Stop breathing!
Can' t you hear it?
There' s someone there.
Come with us
Nicholas?
Anne?
Where are you?
Answer me!
The intruders have found them.
There' s nothing we can do now.
You' il have to go upstairs and talk to them.
Our Father, who art in Heaven... hallowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come...
Thy will be done on earth... as it is in Heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread... and forgive us our trespasses...
Why are you afraid, children?
Why don' t you want us to be your friends?
Speak to us
Speak to us
Tell me what happened.
"Don' t tell her"
If I tell her, they' il leave us in peace.
"Mummy."
Why are you crying, children?
What happened in this room?
What did your mother do to you?
Something about a pillow.
With a pillow?
She didn' t kill us!
Children, if you' re dead why do you remain in this house?
We 're not dead!
Why do you remain in this house?
We 're not dead!
We' re not dead!
We' re not dead. "
We' re not dead!
Yes.
Just a bit dizzy, that' s all.
They made contact.
All three?
Apparently, yes.
The mother and the two children.
Quite interesting, don' t you think?
Interesting?
I was scared out of my wits!
No.
So far, we have handled this matter your way... but now you listen to me.
We can' t possibly stay in this house any longer.
It is quite clear... that these beings do not want us to live here.
We don' t know anything about them yet.
Yes, we do!
We know the woman went mad... smothered her two children, and then shot herself.
That' s quite enough.
Think of our son.
There' s nothing wrong with Victor.
He has nightmares.
He says he has seen that girl... and even this lady has been possessed by her.
Please, let us leave this house
We will leave tomorrow morning.
Oh, thank God for that.
I' il just go and check on Victor.
Once again, thank you so much for coming.
A pleasure.
Though I must admit...
At first, I couldn' t understand what the pillow was doing in my hands or why you didn' t move.
But then I knew.
It had happened.
I had killed my children.
I put it to my forehead.
Then I pulled the trigger.
Nothing.
Then I heard your laughter in the bedroom.
You were playing with the pillows... as if nothing had happened.
And I thought the Lord in His great mercy... was giving me another chance... telling me, "Don' t give up."
"Be a good mother."
But now... now...
what does all this mean?
Where are we?
Young Lydia said the very same thing when she realized the three of us were dead.
And that was the last time she ever spoke.
But I couldn' t tell you that before now.
Shall I make us a nice cup of tea, ma' am?
The intruders are leaving... but others will come.
Other times, we won' t.
Ma' am.
Daddy died in the war, didn' t he?
Yes.
Will we ever see him again?
I don' t know.
If we' re dead, where' s limbo?
I don' t know if there even is a limbo.
I' ve always loved you.
And this house is ours.
This house is ours.
This house is ours.
Mummy, look.
It doesn' t hurt anymore.
No one can make us leave this house.
Come along, Victor.
Evening, handsome.
Hi, Lucille.
How you' ve been?
Lucille:
Evening, Hank.
She' s good.
Here you go.
How you been?
- Pretty good, and you?
- Pretty good.
How' s Sonny?
He' s all right, I guess.
Vera, how are you doing?
- I' m good, how are you?
Here.
- You want a drink?
- Oh yeah, thanks hon.
Wild Turkey.
I' m sore, so go easy, darling.
- You' re welcome.
Yeah.
What' s the matter, hon?
You look so sad.
Sonny:
You wanna get something to eat?
- Talk?
- Take care, Sonny.
Morning, Pop.
I' m gonna get some more.
What the hell are those niggers doing out there?
I said something to you.
Did you hear me?
Yeah.
Be moving in here soon.
Sitting next to me... watching my TV.
There was a time when they knew their place.
Wasn' t none of this mixing going on.
Your mother, she hated them niggers, too.
Tell them to get the hell off my property.
- You put that thing down.
We came by to see Sonny.
I don' t give a damn who you come by to see.
They' re your buddies.
What are you standing there for?
You watch your ass, all right?
- Yeah.
Be careful walking around.
- Yeah, yeah.
You see these two boys here?
They' re my sons.
They were on my property.
No need to be scared of no little boys.
No need to be letting off no shotgun to tell them to leave, either.
You understand?
Then keep 'em off my property.
They' re friends to your son, okay?
They ain' t trespassing, they ain' t hurting nobody.
Next time you wanna play cowboy, I' m over here all the time.
Well, you keep them off my property.
- I think you heard me too.
Come on boys, let' s go.
Aw, shit!
- You' re all right, Dappa.
- Yeah, I' m all right.
- You' re sure?
Yeah.
Did you see what you did, Sonny?
It was my mistake.
- Yeah, it was.
- It won' t happen next time.
Let' s just keep going till we get it right.
- (more laughter) - Woman:
I' m surprised you' re talking like that to me.
- I' m a liberated woman.
Better watch out, Georgia Ann,
Oh, that' s okay.
Booter, how you doing?
Just give me the $2. 50, Sonny.
- You keep the rest of it.
- Thanks, Mr. Grotowski.
Just like I said, no more mistakes, all right?
I wanna make damn sure nobody makes any mistakes, especially you.
So when it gets time for us to do it... you can' t mess up.
That goes for me too, and the rest of them.
You ain' t no different then us, you can' t screw it up.
- That' s Hank' s boy.
It' s in the genes.
Yeah, but he' s a boy.
- He will be a man tomorrow.
In England, they give the guy a party the night before.
They call it the Monster' s Ball.
They don' t want no lawyer, no preacher, or anything like that around...
So, it' s just you and me.
We can' t think about what he did or anything else about him.
We have to do our job right.
I' ve been drawing a lot.
What about you?
Boy:
Look here, we ain' t got a lot of time.
I' m going to give you all my drawings... all my clothes.
When you get older, they may fit you and you may want to wear them.
I' m not gonna see you again after this?
No.
Why?
- 'Cause I' m a bad man.
I do.
But I want you to know something.
What?
You ain' t me.
- Yes I am.
- No, you' re not.
You' re everything that' s good about me.
This man you see sitting here today, you ain' t.
Hey, baby.
You look nice, today.
You always look nice.
Tyrell, did you tell your daddy what you won at school?
My drawing' s getting used for the school magazine cover.
- What did you do?
Don' t be playing no guessing games.
I made a picture of you... sitting alone... in jail.
The theme was solitude.
Put it there, boy.
Not too bad.
What' s going on with the car?
It' s leaking radiator fluid.
Take it in right away.
Have them check the hoses.
The car get too hot, you' re gonna be in trouble.
The house?
I' m losing it.
I can' t afford to make the payments no more.
Not no more.
I' m sorry, baby.
Okay.
Come on, now.
Only reason I' m here, so you can say goodbye to your son.
I been coming here for damn near 11 years, Lawrence.
And I' m tired.
I' m tired of coming here.
- Officer # 1:
- So soon?
I got to get going, baby.
Time for me to go, Ty.
I' m gonna call you.
You wait by the phone, okay?
You got to let go.
For every time I hurt you, I' m sorry.
Ma' am, let' s go.
Ma' am, let' s go.
- (door closes) - I know my way out of here.
Come on.
looks like we' re definitely gonna do it tonight.
Everybody okay?
- You all right, Georgia Ann?
Dappa, is that hood ready?
Yeah, it' s fixed and ready to go.
Anybody got anything to say?
Hank:
He likes to draw.
It calms him down.
Draw?
- Yeah.
Phil, will you make sure he' s got whatever it is he needs to draw with?
Okay.
Open cell 1 3!
I' m here for your stuff, man.
Tommy:... that the Lord save us his anointing.
Ye will hear Him in His holy Heaven, and the saving strength of His right hand.
Be careful with this.
Don' t worry about it, man.
- Close 1 3!
Worry' s all I' ve got.... some in chariots, some in horses. but we remember the name of the Lord, our God.
They' re brought down and fallen, but we are risen and stand upright.
Save us, Lord.
Let the King hear us when we call Him.
I' m gonna put these on nice and loose.
Yes, sir.
What about my last phone call?
Warden says it' s a bad idea.
Turn around.
I don' t think so.
- (buzz)
Let' s go.
- (buzz)
Starting to feel a little cramped by your present surroundings?
Maybe it' s time to expand your horizons.
Maybe it' s time to think about ReMax.

It' s my right to have my paper and pencil.
Your paper and pencil' s on the way.
I promise you it is.
Thank you.
You' re welcome.
Here you go, Lawrence.
Is that done?
Let' s see.
Wow.
It' s real nice.
I don' t look this good in person.
- Thank you.
- You' re welcome.
You' re welcome.
You all right?
Sonny.
- Hank:
Sonny.
Sonny, sit down.
Sit down.
Come on, buddy.
It' s all right.
Just let go.
Come on.
I' ve always believed that a portrait captures a person... far better than a photograph.
It truly takes a human being to really see a human being.
Wait a minute.
Come here.
What the hell is this, Tyrell?
Didn' t I tell you don' t be eating that shit?
Look all this fat!
This fat ass!
Look all this nasty fat!
Where they at?!
Look at all this candy!
You ain' t eating all this candy!
Look at this room!
Why is it a mess?
'Cause a fat piggy lives in this room!
Get your ass on this scale!
What does it say?
- Tyrell:
You ain' t lost no weight!
Come on.
Let' s go wait for your daddy to call.
It is ordered and adjudged that the judgment pronounced and set forth sentencing the defendant to death in the manner and by the authorities as provided by statute, shall be executed at this time.
Lawrence Musgrove, do you have anything you' d like to say?
Push the button.
Do you know what you did?
Do you know what you did?
Are you listening to me?
Do you know what you did?!
Do you know what you did?!
You fucked up that man' s last walk!
How would you like it if somebody fucked up your last walk?!
You' re like a woman, like your fucking mother!
You shouldn' t have done that, you son of a bitch!
Get up, you fucking pussy!
You are a piece of fucking shit!
Do you understand me?!
- Easy, easy!
- Hank!
- This ain' t you!
- This is me, Phil!
And I' m the man who could have your job!
Don' t let me catch you touching anybody that outranks you again!
- Do you understand me?
"Yes, sir"?
- I just keep the peace.
You piece of shit!
You got -- bleeding.
Get up!
Get out of my goddamn house!
You get out!
You lousy piece of shit!
What are you gonna do, huh?
What are you gonna do?!
How do you like that, huh?
Are you tough?
Say something.
Get up.
You hate me.
Answer me.
Yeah, I hate you.
I always did.
Well, I always loved you.
Hand me the scissors.
- Where are you going?
- I want to put these up.
- How much?
- That' il be $2. 85.
Billy, I' m moving as fast as I can.
I' il put this dress on and I' il be right there.
- Damn car still acting up.
You' ve been late every day.
I need this money.
- Look, go home, relax.
Take some time off.
That' s why you should have given me the week off.
- With some pay.
- We already got a new girl.
Hank?
- Let' s get this over with quick.
- You' d like me to read?
- No.
All I want to hear is that dirt hitting that box.
He was weak.
You can say something if you want, once we' ve covered him up.
- You want to see a menu?
- No, I know what I want.
What you gonna have?
A bowl of chocolate ice cream... and a cup of coffee.
- Black, sugar, cream?
- That' s it.
Hey, Vera, it' s Hank.
Is it too late?
Chocolate ice cream.
I' il take a plastic spoon for the ice cream.
Oh, Goddamn!
Sorry about that.
- Shit!
I didn' t mean to do that.
I' m sorry about that.
And you said a what --
Plastic spoon.
- Where' s Lucille?
- I' m trying to fill in for her.
- Yep.
- (machine beeps) - What' s the deal here?
I don' t know.
I just overrang this thing.
If you can' t get it open, tell me how much it is, and I' il pay you for it. $3. 92.
Here' s $4. 00.
Keep the change.
Thanks.
Hey, cowboy, feel like some late- night pussy?
I guess so.
Haven' t seen you in a while.
Yeah, well...
I ain' t been feeling too good.
Busy with this and that and the other.
- All right.
Good.
So how' s Sonny?
I can' t do this tonight, Vera.
- Are you sure, hon?
- No, not tonight.
- I' m sorry.
- No need to be.
Some other time.
All right.
You can keep that money.
I' m going to.
Adios.
Have a seat, Hank.
- Thank you, sir.
I appreciate you seeing me.
What brings you here?
Sir, I' m resigning and I wanted to come by and tell you personally.
I appreciate that, Hank.
Why don' t we wait a few weeks before we submit the paperwork?
That wouldn' t do anybody any good to wait on that.
I' ve got my mind made up.
All right.
We' re gonna miss you.
I brought my badge in and...
- Why don' t you keep it?
- I ain' t got no use for it.
There you are, Pop.
We got each other... son.
- Remember that.
- Yes, sir.
I quit the team.
That was a mistake.
I can' t do it anymore.
You' re reminding me of your mother.
I guess that' s bad, right?
Your mother wasn' t shit.
That woman failed me.
I got more pussy after she killed herself... than I did when she was living as my wife.
The point is... she quit on me.
You' re doing the same.
Goddamnit!
Let' s go.
Hand me my purse.
Come on.
- Why, Mama, what' s wrong?
- We' ve got to walk.
Tyrell, get off that street!
Don' t do that!
This is just what I' m looking for.
At the same time, it' s the most expensive one.
Attendant:
We put quite a bit of work into it.
We could talk about it.
Let me think it over.
- Attendant:
- It was a pleasure.
- Nice talking to you.
See you.
Let' s go.
That' s what you think your mama looks like?
Yeah, sort of.
- Yeah.
- Bye.
Get up!
Get up!
Help me!
Wait!
Come back here!
Wake up!
Wake up!
- He was hit by a car!
- It' s okay.
Right now!
We' il need a gurney out here.
I think it' s bad.
We' il need some help.
Are you the boy' s mother?
Please, follow me.
Is that your boy?
No.
What happened?
I think he got hit by a car.
- She said he was hit by a car.
- Hit and run?
I don' t know.
I need you to file a police report if it was a hit and run.
Shit, I don' t even know them.
I wouldn' t know what to write.
Just stay, tell the police what you did and saw.
It' il be five minutes.
That' s my baby!
I know you' re not supposed to move people, but I didn' t know what else to do.
The boy was laying there... and the woman was hysterical.
I just lugged him in the car to come here as quick as I could.
That' s what I did.
You did a good job.
So you were just passing by?
Yeah, I don' t know the lady at all.
I' il give you my card.
We' il do a follow- up if we get anything.
We might call you as well, if we need to.
- That' d be all right?
- Whatever you need me to do.
I got your number right there.
Can I go?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Will that boy make it all right?
No, he died.
Mrs. Musgrove, I' il give you my card and you feel free to call me anytime that you can remember anything about this.
I' m so sorry.
Can I get something to clean that off?
- Here' s your purse.
- He' s gone.
- Yes, ma' am.
He' s gone.
(Leticia sobs)
Will you take her home?
I don' t really know her.
- That' s a good idea.
Yeah, I' il take her home.
- Yes, sir.
- I' d appreciate that.
Where do you live?
Ma' am, you' il have to tell me where you live.
Now, I' il go in your purse.
I' m letting you know I' m going in your purse to find an address on you.
You should call some of your kin people or a friend or something.
I' m going to have to go.
You gonna be all right?
They told me to call the Coroner' s Office in the morning.
I' m sorry?
They told me to call the Coroner' s Office.
They said they gonna do an autopsy.
I don' t know why they' il do an autopsy.
He was hit by a car.
I imagine that' il help them find out who did it.
You really believe they' il do that?
I believe they' il try their best.
He' s a Black kid.
You think they' il do that?
I' il leave it on the floor.
I' m real sorry.
Mr. Grotowski?
Just want to say sorry about Sonny.
- We liked him a lot.
- We feel bad, sir.
Which one of you is Willie and which' s one' s Harry?
He' s Darryl.
I appreciate that.
I' m going over to the cafe.
Do you want a ride?
You sure you don' t mind?
I' m going that way anyway.
Is this music all right with you?
- 'Cause I can change it.
- No, it' s cool.
You ain' t got a car?
It' s broke.
I' m saving to get me another one.
Leticia: $8. 64.
Thank you.
Leticia:
- You' re welcome.
Hey, Pop?
- Look it here.
- What are those for?
I bought a gas station.
- Mmm- hmm.
It' s all bought and paid for.
- (Buck sneezes)
Don' t say "we."
You own it.
I didn' t buy it.
- Yeah, well...
- I wouldn' t have bought no gas station.
Is that right?
I would have stuck to what I knew best.
- What' s that?
- Corrections Officer.
Right.
Well, I ain' t a Corrections Officer no more.
I' m a gas- station owner.
I already made the deal.
It' s too late, Pop.
No.
Here you go.
How are you doing?
I' m doing all right.
Tired.
- Chocolate ice cream.
Plastic spoon.
You got it.
- Mmm- hmm.
- Mmm- hmm.
Did you want me to give you a ride?
I really couldn' t ask you to do that.
It' s right on the way home.
- You sure you don' t mind?
- No, I' d be happy to.
Clement' s?
Yeah.
I know Clement.
- I can' t stand that man.
Leticia:
Well, that' s good.
Thanks for the ride.
Can I ask you a question?
Why did you help me?
- What do you mean?
Why did you do that?
I guess --
I just -- doing the right thing, I guess.
My son died.
And --
well, he -- he died and then --
I never was a very good father.
He was a good kid.
I guess that somehow I just -- when I see what you' re going through there it made me think about something.
I don' t know.
You know when you feel like you can' t breathe?
Really.
Do you want to come inside?
I like these curtains.
I got these here curtains on credit.
I never heard of anybody getting curtains on credit before.
What do you think?
Ain' t they cute?
Hank:
They' re good and red all right.
I got --
And the man told me... that I wasn' t supposed to get this deal.
But I think he liked me, and he told me I could have these curtains on credit.
So I said, I' il take it.
- Damn straight.
You sure suck that whiskey down.
I mean, Lord have mercy.
My husband used to love him some Jack Daniel' s.
Like I said, it' s a good drink.
I' il show you something.
- Okay.
What you got?
Some kind of a school annual?
No.
These pictures right here -- these are my husband' s drawings right here.
Lawrence.
My husband, he drew those.
He got himself electrocuted over there in Jackson.
He got himself --
These right here, these are my son Tyrell' s.
He drew these.
He drew all of these right here.
He got his talent from the old man, I guess.
That' s the only thing that negro ever gave that boy, was some drawing.
Taught him how to draw.
It runs in the family, sounds like it.
he was a good kid.
He was a really good kid.
He was so good.
He was -- he really -- he loved me.
I understand.
He was so fat.
You saw how fat he was.
I don' t care what I brought in this house, he just ate it up!
I don' t care what it was I brought in.
I bring some Popeye' s chicken, that boy eat the whole thing before I can get a bite!
He would eat his ass off!
You haven' t seen nobody eat like --
He would eat candy and gumballs.
He' d make me take him to the Super K- Mart and he put them quarters in that gumball machine.
He had to wait till he get the red gumball.
He always had to get the red gumball.
He sounds like a character, I guess.
He' d get that red gumball and he' d just eat on that red gumball.
I was a good mother.
I did -- every single thing I can think to do --
I was really good.
- I was a good mother.
- I understand.
I did not want my baby to be fat like that,
'cause I know, a Black man in America, you can' t be like that!
And I tried to --
I was trying to tell him,
"You can' t be like that, you can' t be like that in America, and a Black man."
I was just...
I' m not sure what you want me to do.
I want you to make me feel better.
I want you to make me feel good.
Can you make me feel good?
I don' t know what to feel good' s about.
Just make me feel good!
I felt it too.
I needed you so much.
I needed you so much.
I hadn' t felt anything in so long.
Thank you.
You okay?
Me getting sick doesn' t have anything to do with you.
Pop?
Buck:
I' m in the damn bathroom!
What the hell happened to you?
I twisted my ankle trying to take a bath.
Damn it, I told you to be careful.
Goddamn!
Wiggle your toes.
- Yeah.
Yeah?
I' m sinking.
- What are you talking about?
- You stop that.
- I can' t clean myself.
Can' t walk to the kitchen without falling.
Can' t get to the phone before it stops ringing.
I don' t feel like a man anymore.
You' re a man, Pop.
Can' t even remember what a woman smells like.
There' s a man here.
Man:
- How are you doing?
- Hey, how are you doing?
What can I do for you?
I got this' 89 Comanche out there... it needs a lube job, new points and plugs.
I was wondering if you' d work on it for me.
When do you need it by?
Just as quick as you can, really.
Leave that alone, baby.
Put that down.
late tomorrow then?
I' d appreciate it.
Maybe them boys of yours can -- if they' re not doing anything -- wash it and wax it and everything?
I' m selling it.
All right.
I' il tell them about it.
I can' t take this.
It was my son' s.
He' d want somebody to use it.
I just can' t take it.
I really do.
It' d mean a lot to me.
Let' s just take it for a little spin.
- I ain' t even got my shoes on.
- We won' t go far.
You see how it drives.
- What the hell is this?
- Stick shift.
It' s all set.
- I' d like to see you tonight.
- We should do that.
- Is that all right?
- I' il see you later.
- See you.
Hank?
Hank:
Hank!
It' s Leticia.
I' m coming on in, Hank.
Who are you?
You just walked in my house?
My bad.
- I -- - Hank?
- You' re looking for Hank?
Is he here?
Who are you?
My name is Leticia Musgrove.
And... me and Hank is... friends.
Musgrove?
Please, little darling... have you got a cigarette?
Yeah.
But it look to me like you don' t need to be smoking.
Have you got one?
Match?
So, is Hank here?
Yeah.
I' m Buck, his father.
Is that for Hank?
It' s a gift.
I' il see he gets it.
Damn!
Hank must have done something right to deserve a fine hat like this.
I guess he did.
In my prime, I had a thing for nigger juice myself.
Hank' s just like his daddy.
He ain' t a man till he split dark oak.
Hey, Leticia?
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
- What happened?
- You can' t do that.
Whatever he did --
It don' t matter a whole lot, do it?
- Give me a chance to talk to you.
- Get off me!
We' re family.
I' m your father.
Remember that.
Hank?
What' s your problem?
I believe that' s it.
- Thank you.
I didn' t date that thing at the bottom.
No problem.
Anything below that line, I didn' t do.
Now, you will take good care of him?
- Woman:
I want him to go out in peace.
You must love him very much.
No, I don' t.
So, there it is.
They' il get you a TV set tomorrow.
Finally getting rid of me, huh?
They' il take care of you.
There' s a telephone at the end of the hall.
You can call me.
This is it.
I guess so.
I' m stuck.
Me too.
I don' t want to go out like this.
Me neither.
Goodbye, Pop.
What?
You want your car back?
No, I don' t want the car back.
I mean for you to keep that.
What?
I want you to know I sent him away.
I ain' t got time to talk.
I wish you would talk to me.
How are you doing, Ryrus?
How are you?
- I' m all right.
- Who' s Leticia?
My girlfriend.
Sheriff' s Department.
- Who' s banging on my door?
- Time to go, lady.
- No, no wait.
- Time to go.
No, I don' t take anything.
You settle with your landlord, then I go away.
No, I got the money.
I suggest you get fully dressed.
- I' m going to put you out.
- You ain' t putting me out.
I 'bout got the money.
I' m still saving --
I painted the ceiling and the wall and fixed it up a little bit.
I' il move your stuff here so you don' t have to worry with it.
I' m going to the kitchen to get a thing or two so if you want to relax, make yourself comfortable.
Whatever you want to do.
- This is Tyrell' s.
- I thought I' d put it up there.
That' s my boy' s room.
Here.
You can go up if you want to.
Can I look at these?
Yeah, go ahead.
That' s him right there.
He don' t look like you.
He got his mother in him.
I don' t mind sleeping across the hall if you want me to.
- No...
I wouldn' t feel good if you left me in here all by myself.
I just want you to be comfortable here.
I want you to be comfortable too.
I want to take care of you.
Leticia:
'Cause I really need to be taken care of.
Can I touch you?
Did you feel that?
Oh yeah.
Did it feel good?
I didn' t hurt you or anything?
Not in a bad way.
What?
Nothing, I just --
I want to go out and buy some ice cream.
- Now?
- Yeah.
It just feels right.
Can you buy me some?
What kind do you want?
Chocolate.
I bought some chocolate ice cream.
Are you okay?
You sure?
You look real pretty.
You want to?
I went by our station on the way home.
I like the sign.
I think we' il be all right.
[Orchestra Tuning Up]
"The Sound of Music"]
[Orchestra Continues]
["Cancan"]
Overland and sea
A little shy
But very wise
Was he
And then one day
He passed my way
And while we spoke of many things
Fools and kings
[Man]
The greatest thing [Quiet Sobbing]
Is just to love
The Moulin Rouge.
A nightclub.
A dancehall and a bordello...
- The Moulin Rouge! - ruled over by Harold Zidler.
A kingdom of nighttimepleasures, where the rich and powerful came to play with the young and beautiful creatures... of the underworld.
The most beautiful of all these... was the woman I loved.
Satine.
A courtesan, she sold herlove to men.
They called her "the sparkling diamond," and she was the star... of the Moulin Rouge.
[Crowd Cheering]
The woman I loved... is... dead.
- [Typing Resumes]
- I first came to Paris... one year ago.
It was 1899, the summer of love.
I knew nothing of the Moulin Rouge, Harold Zidler... or Satine.
The world had been swept up in bohemian revolution, and I had traveled from London to be a part of it.
On the hill near Paris was the village of Montmartre.
- Of the revolution - Musicians, painters, writers.
They were known as "the children of the revolution."
and that which I believed in above all things -- love.
Always this ridiculous obsession with love!
There was only one problem -- I' d never been in love.
- Luckily, right at that moment, an unconscious Argentinean fell through my roof.
He was quickly joined by a dwarf dressed as a nun.
How do you do?
My name is Henri Marie Raymond Toulouse- Lautrec Monfa.
- What?
- I' m terribly sorry about all this.
- We were just upstairs rehearsing a play.
- What?
A play, something very modern called Spectacular Spectacular.
- And it' s set in Switzerland.
- Unfortunately, the unconscious Argentinean... suffered from a sickness called narcolepsy.
Perfectly fine one moment, then suddenly -- [Snores] unconscious the next.
How is he?
Wonderful.
Now the narcoleptic Argentinean is now unconscious.
Therefore, the scenario will not be finished in time to present to the financier tomorrow.
He' s right, Toulouse.
I still have to finish the music.
- Find someone to read the part.
[Narrator Continues]
The hills animate
Oh, stop, stop!
Stop, stop, stop, stop!
Stop that insufferable droning.
It' s drowning out my words.
Can we please just stick to a little decorative piano?
There seemed to be artistic differences over Audrey' s lyrics to Satie' s songs.
I don' t think a nun would say that about a hill.
What if he sings, "The hills are vital, intoning the descant"?
- No, no.
The hills quake and shake.
- No, no, no, no.
The hills --
The hills are incarnate with symphonic melodies!
- No.
- No.
The hills --
- The hills -- - The hills --
Are chanting the eternal mantra.
Frank is living in my foot.
The hills are alive
With the sound
Whoa!
The hills are alive with the sound of music!
I love it!
- The hills are alive -- - With the sound --
With songs they have sung
For a thousand years
- Incandiferous!
- Audrey, you two should write the show together.
- I beg your pardon?
But Toulouse' s suggestion that Audrey and I write the show together...
- was not what Audrey wanted to hear.
- Good- bye!
Here' s toyour first job in Paris.
Toulouse, Zidler will never agree.
No offense, but have you ever written anything like this before?
- No.
- Ahh!
- The boy has talent!
I like him!
Nothing funny.
I just like talent.
See, Satie, with Christian we can write... the truly bohemian revolutionary show that we' ve always dreamt of.
- But how will we convince Zidler?
- But Toulouse had a plan.
- Satine.
- They would dress me in the Argentinean' s best suit... and pass me off as a famous English writer.
Once Satine heard my modern poetry, she would be astounded... and insist to Zidler that I write Spectacular Spectacular.
The only problem was, I kept hearing my father' s voice in my head.
You' il end up wasting your life at the Moulin Rouge... with a cancan dancer!
- No, I can' t write the show for the Moulin Rouge!
- Why not?
- I don' t even know if I am a true bohemian revolutionary.
- What?
- Do you believe in beauty?
- Freedom?
- Yes, ofcourse.
- Truth?
- Yes.
- Love?
Love?
Love.
Above all things, I believe in love.
Love is like oxygen.
Love is a many- splendored thing.
Love lifts us up where we belong.
All you need is love.
See, you can' t fool us.
You' re the voice of the children of the revolution!
We can' t be fooled!
Let' s drink to the new writer of the world' s first bohemian revolutionary show!
It was the perfect plan.
I was to audition for Satine, and I would taste my first glass of... absinthe.
[All]
The hills are alive
With the sound ofmusic [Hysterical Laughing]
Yeah, freedom, beauty
Truth and love
- The hills are alive - No, you won' t fool the children of the revolution
- No, you won' t fool the children - With the sound ofmusic
- Of the revolution - We were off to the Moulin Rouge.
Yaaah!
Harold Zidler and his infamous girls.
- They called them his "Diamond Dogs." - The Diamond Dogs
Mission accomplished.
We successfully evaded Zidler.
It' s her, the sparkling diamond.
To die
For love
In fighting duels
[Narrating]
But someone else was to meet Satine that night.
But I prefer a man
And gives expensive jewels
The Duke.
- When am I going to meet the girl?
- Tiffany' s!
After her number, I' ve arranged a special meeting, just you and Mademoiselle Satine.
- Totally alone.
- Cartier.
After her number, I have arranged a private meeting, just you and Mademoiselle Satine totally alone.
- Alone?
- Yes, totally alone.
- Totally alone.
- Ow!
Excuse me.
- Black Star, Roscor.
Talk to me, Harry Zidler.
There may come a time
- When a lass needs a lawyer - Ohh!
But diamonds are a girl' s best friend
There may come a time
When a hard- boiled employer
- Awfully nice
Don' t worry, don' t worry.
I' il sally forth and tee things up.
- Is the Duke here, Harold?
- Liebchen, would Daddy let you down?
- Terribly sorry!
- Where is he?
- He' s the one Toulouse is shaking a hanky at.
Excuse me, Christian.
May I borrow?
- Are you sure?
[Groans]
Let me finish.
I' m ever so sorry!
It' s so embarrassing.
- That' s the one, chickpea.
I hope that demonic little loon doesn' t frighten him off.
Clean yourself off, you bourgeois pig!
Sorry.
- Will he invest?
- Pigeon!
After spending the night with you, how could he refuse?
What' s his type?
Wilting flower, hmm?
Bright and bubbly? Ah!
Or smoldering temptress? [Purring]
I' d say smoldering temptress.
We' re all relying on you, gosling.
Remember, a real show in a real theater, with a real audience.
- And you' il be -- - A real actress.
- 'Cause that' s when those louses - Ooh!
- Go back to their spouses - Be jeweled vision!
- Diamonds
- Are a - I' ve got some exciting news!
Girl' s
Friend
- I believe you are expecting me.
Yes.
[Squeals]
Satine! Satine! Satine!
I see you' ve already met my English friend.
I' il take care of it, Toulouse.
Let' s dance.
- [Whooping]
- Feel the beat of the rhythm of the night
Feel the beat of the rhythm of the night
- Dance until the morning light - [Trilling]
- Incredible.
- He has a gift with the women.
Whoo!
That Duke certainly can dance.
So wonderful of you to take an interest in our little show.
It sounds very exciting.
I' d be delighted to be involved.
- Really?
- Assuming you like what I do, of course.
I' m sure I will.
- Oh- ho!
- Toulouse thought we might be able to, um, do it in private.
- Did he?
- [Grunts]
Ohh!
Mmm, a poetry reading.
Oh, I love a little poetry after supper.
Entertain us
Here we are now entertain us
- 'Cause we' re stupid - Hang on to your hat!
[Cheering]
Diamonds
Diamonds
Their shape
- Fantastic!
[Zidler]
No!
Satine! Satine! Satine! Satine!
Don' t know if that Duke' s gonna get his money' s worth tonight.
Don' t be unkind, Nini.
[Crowd]
Satine!
looking for a partner or two!
- [Bandleader]
All together, now!
- Out of my way.
Quickly.
Oh, Marie.
Oh, these silly costumes.
- Just a little fainting spell.
- All right, you girls.
Get back out front and make those gents thirsty.
Problems?
- Nothing for you to be worrying about.
- Don' t just stand around.
[Panting, Coughing]
Come out of the garden, baby
You' il catch your death in the fog
- They call them the Diamond Dogs - Yaah!
Find Zidler.
The girl' s waiting for me.
- That twinkle- toes Duke has really taken the bait, girl.
With a patron like him, you could be the next Sarah Bernhardt.
Oh, Marie, do you really think I could be like the great Sarah?
Why not?
You' ve got the talent.
You hook that Duke, and you' il be lighting up the great stages of Europe.
I' m gonna be a real actress, Marie.
A great actress.
I' m gonna fly away from here.
Oh, yes, we can fly, fly away from here!
- Duckling, is everything all right?
- Oh, yes.
- Ofcourse, Harold.
- Oh, thank goodness.
You certainly weaved your magic with that duke on the dance floor.
- [Gasps]
- Smoldering temptress.
- Oh, my little strawberry!
How could he possibly resist from gobbling you up?
Everything' s going so well!
I' il meet you in the red room
- Close the door and dim the lights - Unbelievable!
Straight to the elephant!
This is a wonderful place for a poetry reading.
Don' t you think?
Hmm?
- Poetic enough for you?
- Yes.
A little, uh, supper?
Maybe some champagne?
I' d rather just, um, get it over and done with.
Very well.
Then why don' tyou... come down here?
Let' s get it over and done with.
- Oh.
- You don' t have to stand.
It' s sometimes that it' s quite long, and I' d like you to be comfortable.
It' s quite modern what I do, and it may feel a little strange at first, but I think if you' re open, then you might enjoy it.
- I' m sure I will.
- Excuse me.
The --
Come on.
Come on.
- [Moaning]
- I think --
Oh, riki- tiki- tiki- tiki.
Um, is everything allright?
Um, I' m a little nervous.
- It' s just sometimes it takes a while for, - Oh! you know, inspiration to come.
Let Mummy help, hmm?
- Does that inspire you?
- Let' s make love.
- Make love?
- You want to, don' t you?
- Well, I came to -- - No, tell the truth.
- Can' t you feel the poetry?
- What?
Oh, come on.
- Oh!
Big boy.
He' s got a huge talent!
Yes, I need your poetry now!
- All right.
- It' s a little bit funny.
- What?
This f- feeling inside.
I' m not one of those who can -- who can easily hide.
Is this -- Is this okay?
Is this what you want?
Oh, poetry.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, this is whatI want, naughty words.
- I -- I don' t have much money, - Oh, naughty! - but, boy, if I did, - Oh, yes!
- I' d buy a big house where we both could live.
- Oh, I love them.
- Oh, it' s so good!
- IfI were a sculptor --
- Wonderful.
- But then again, no.
- Wonderful.
- Or a man who makes potions at a traveling show.
Don' t!
- No, no, no.
Don' t stop.
- I know it' s not much.
Yes!
- But it' s the best I can do.
- Oh, naughty!
Yes!
It' s for people like you
I can' t believe it.
I' m in love.
- [Giggles]
- Duke?
Not that the title' s important, ofcourse.
I' m not a duke.
- Not a duke?
- I' m a writer.
- A writer?
- [Satine]
No!
- Toulouse?
Oh, no.
You' re not another of Toulouse' s oh- so- talented, charmingly bohemian,
- tragically impover is hedproteges?
- You might say that, yes.
Oh, no!
- I' m going to kill him!
I' m going to kill him!
- There might be a small hitch.
- Toulouse told me -- - What about the Duke?
- [Gasps]
The Duke!
- The Duke?
- Hide!
Out the back!
[Gasping]
Where were you?
I, uh --
- I was waiting.
- Dearest Duke.
Allow me to introduce Mademoiselle Satine.
Mmm, monsieur, how wonderful of you to take time out of your busy schedule to visit.
The pleasure, I fear, will be entirely mine, my dear.
I' il leave you two squirrels to get better acquainted.
Ta- ta.
A kiss on the hand maybe quite continental -- [Chuckles]
Oh.
Well.
After tonight' s pretty exertions on the stage, you must surely be in need of refreshment, my dear.
Don' t!
love the view, hmm?
Charming.
Whoo- whoo!
- You see, I should like a glass of champagne.
- No!
It' s -- It' s a little bit funny.
- What is?
- This...
- Feeling. - feeling...
I' m not one of those -- - I' m not one of those...
- [Crashing]
No!
[Whimpering]
I hope you don' t mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is
Now you' re in
The world
That' s very beautiful.
It' s from Spectacular Spectacular.
Suddenly, with you here,
I finally understood the true meaning of those words.
"How wonderful life is now you' re in the world."
[Cries Out]
No, no!
Duke!
Don' t you toy with my emotions.
[Sobs]
Let' s make love!
You want to make love, don' t you?
- Mmm!
I knew you felt the same way!
Oh!
Oh, Duke!
Get out of here or he' il kill you.
Yes, you' re right.
We should wait until opening night.
Wait?
Wait? Uh --
There' s a power in you that scares me.
- You should go.
- I just got here.
Yes, but we' il see each other every day during rehearsal.
We- We must wait.
We must wait until opening night.
Get out.
Oh, my G --
Satine.
- Let' s have a little peekaboo.
Oh, right on target.
Right.
I' il put her in bed.
[Grunts]
I forgot my hat.
- Foul play?
- She --
- Oh, Duke.
- It' s a little bit funny, this feeling inside.
Beautifully spoken, Duke.
Yes, let me introduce you.
The writer.
- The writer?
- Yes, we were rehearsing.
You expect me to believe that scantily clad, in the arms of another man, in the middle of the night, inside an elephant, you were rehearsing?
How' s the rehearsal going?
- Shall we take it from the top, eh?
- I hope the piano' s in tune.
- Sorry.
Got held up.
- Can I offer you a drink?
Oh, my goodness!
When I spoke those words to you before, you -- you filled me with such inspiration.
Yes, I realized how much work we had to do, so I called everyone for an emergency rehearsal.
If you' re rehearsing, where' s Zidler?
- We didn' t bother Harold.
- My dear Duke, I' m most terribly sorry.
Harold, you made it.
It' s all right.
The Duke knows about the emergency rehearsal.
- Emergency rehearsal?
- Hmm?
- I' m sure Audrey will be only too delighted --
- Audrey' s left.
- He' s what?
- The cat' s out of the bag.
Yes, the Duke' s already a big fan of our new writer' s work.
- That' s why he' s so keen to invest.
- Invest?
Invest!
Oh, yes, well, invest!
You can hardly blame me for trying to hide, uh --
- Christian.
- Christian away.
- I' m way ahead of you, Zidler.
- My dear Duke.
Why don' t you and I go to my office to peruse the paperwork?
- What' s the story?
- The story?
Well, if I' m to invest, I' il need to know the story.
Well, the story' s about --
Toulouse?
Well, the story' s -- the story' s about --
- Well, it' s- it' s about -- - It' s about love.
- Love?
- It' s about love overcoming all obstacles.
And it' s set in Switzerland!
- Switzerland?
- Exotic Switzerland!
India.
India!
It' s set in India!
And there' s a courtesan.
The most beautiful courtesan in all the world.
But her kingdom' s invaded by an evil maharajah!
In order to save her kingdom, she has to seduce the evil maharajah.
But on the night of the seduction, she mistakes a penniless -- a penni -- pennilesssitarplayer... for the evil maharajah, and she falls in love with him.
He wasn' t trying to trick her or anything, but he was dressed as a maharajah... because he' s appearing in a play.
I will play penniless tango- dancing sitar player.
Yes.
Yes, all right.
And what happens next?
Well, the penniless sitar player and the courtesan, they have to hide their love from the evil maharajah.
The penniless sitar player' s sitar is magical.
It can only speak the truth.
- [Imitating Notes]
You are beautiful.
You are ugly.
- And you are -- - [All Gasping]
- And he gives the game away?
- Yes!
- Tell him about the cancan.
- The- The tantric cancan --
It' s an erotic spectacular scene that captures the thrusting, violent, vibrant, wild bohemian spirit... that this whole production embodies, Duke.
- What do you mean by that?
- I mean the show will be... a magnificent, opulent, tremendous, stupendous, gargantuan bedazzlement, a sensual ravishment.
- It will be...
- [Glissando]
Spectacular Spectacular!
No words in the vernacular
- Indians - And courtesans
- Acrobats - And juggling bears
- Musclemen, contortionists intrigue, danger - And romance
Electric lights, machinery and all that electricity
So exciting, the audience will stomp and cheer
So delighting it will run for 50 years
[Gasps]
The courtesan and sitar man
Are pulled apart by an evil plan
But in the end she hears his song
It' s a little bit funny
So exciting, the audience will stomp and cheer
- [Whinnying]
- I am the evil maharajah!
- You will not escape!
- Harold, no one could play him like you could.
- So exciting, we' il make them laugh, we' il make them cry
- So delighting - And in the end, should someone die?
Generally, I like it.
Zidler had an investor, and the bohemians had a show.
The end of the century!
- You won' t fool the children of the revolution
- No, you won' t fool the children of the revolution - You' re a beautiful woman.
[Guffawing]
While the celebration party raged upstairs, I tried to write.
How wonderful life is
Was she thinking about me?
Now you' re in
Duke? I' m not a duke.
I' m a writer.
He wasn' t trying to trick her or anything.
It' s about love.
Fly
- Sorry!
- I didn' t mean to --
I saw -- I saw your light on, and...
- I climbed up the -- - What?
Oh.
Ofcourse.
Yes, Toulouse -- Toulouse was right.
You' re --
- Oh.
It' s going to be a wonderful show.
Anyway, I- I' d better go because we, uh -- we both have a big day tomorrow.
Wait.
No, please, wait.
Before, when we were -- when we were -- when you thought I was the Duke, you said that you loved me, a- and I wondered if --
- I fit was just an act?
- Yes.
- Ofcourse.
- Oh.
It just felt real.
Christian, I' m a courtesan.
I' m paid to make men believe what they want to believe.
Yes.
Silly of me, to think y- you could fall in love with someone like me.
- I can' t fall in love with anyone.
- Can' t fall in love?
But a life with out love, that' s terrible.
No, being on the street, that' s terrible.
- No, love is like oxygen.
- What?
- She' il end up on the street.
- All you need is love
Get down!
No, I won' t.
I' il drink all the time.
You' re gonna be bad for business.
I can tell.
How wonderful life was, now Satine was in the world.
But in the Duke,
Zidler had gotten much more than he had bargained for.
The conversion ofthe Moulin Rouge into a theater will cost a fantastic sum of money.
So in return, I would require a contract... that, um, uh, binds Satine to me... exclusively.
Naturally, I shall require some security.
I shall require the deeds to the Moulin Rouge.
My dear Duke, I --
Please!
Don' t think that I' m naive, Zidler.
I shall hold the deeds to the Moulin Rouge.
- And if there are any she nanigans, - I -- my manservant Warner... will deal with it in the only language... that you underworld show folk understand.
Satine will be mine.
It' s not that I' m a jealous man.
I just don' t like... other people touching my things!
[Exhales]
I... understand... completely, Duke.
Good.
Now that we have an understanding, it would appear that, uh, you have the means... to transform your beloved Moulin Rouge --
Into a theater!
I shall woo Satine over supper tonight.
We will have created... the world' s first completely modern, entirely electric, totally bohemian, all- singing, all- dancing... stage spectacular!
[Screaming, Murmuring]
The show must go on!
Yes, the show would go on, but Satine would not attend the supper that night or the following night.
You have betrayed me!
Mad with jealousy, the evil maharajah forces the courtesan... to make the penniless sitarplayer believe she doesn' t love him.
Oh, yes!
Ofcourse!
"Thank you for curing me of my ridiculous obsession with love," says the penniless sitarplayer, throwing money at her feet and leaving the kingdom forever.
- No!
No!
- No!
Oh, but a life without love, that' s terrible.
- Yes, but the sitar player...
- Wait, wait, wait! with the magical sitar --
That' s my part, Christian!
Th- That' s my part!
- Don' t you dare.
No.
[Christian]
"The greatest thing you' il ever learn is just to love... and be loved in return."
- A picnic, sweet lady?
Oh, well, we have so much to do, so much work.
Well, if the young writer can carry a blanket and basket,
I don' t why see why you both can' t do it in my presence.
- So the magical sitar player falls from the roof -- - Yes, I know.
Don' t tell me.
The greatest thing you' il ever --
- Still at it, my sweet?
- Master...
- Alley- oop! make... contract.
Oh, my dear, sweet Duke.
So many lines to learn.
[Christian]
For try as the Duke may, it was almost too easy for the young writer and the lead actress... to invent perfectly legitimate reasons to avoid him.
Mademoiselle Satine, I haven' t quite finished writing that new scene.
The "Will the Lovers Be Meeting at the Sitar Player' s Humble Abode" scene.
I wondered if I could work on it with you later tonight.
But, my dear, I' ve arranged a magnificent supper for us in the gothic tower.
It' s not important.
We could work on it tomorrow.
Oh, how dare you!
It cannot wait until tomorrow.
The "Lovers Will Be Meeting in the SitarPlayer' s HumbleAbode" scene... is the most important in the production.
We will work on it tonight until I am completely satisfied.
- B- B- But, my dear -- - Dear Duke, excuse me.
I' m sorry.
[Zidler]
Nice work! Splendid!
Bright and early tomorrow morning, we begin on act two -- the lovers are discovered.
- Zidler.
- My dear Duke.
Everything is arranged for that special supper in the gothic tower tonight.
You might as well eat it yourself, Zidler.
Her affections are waning.
- Impossible.
- I understand how important her work is to her, but she' s always at it with that damned writer!
If I don' t see her tonight, I' m ballywell leaving!
No, dear Duke!
I' il insist Satine takes the night off.
All right.
All right.
8: 00, then.
- You will come?
Tonight?
Yes.
What time?
- 8: 00.
- Promise?
- Yes.
Go!
- Are you mad?
The Duke holds the deeds to the Moulin Rouge.
He' s spending a fortune on you.
He' s given you a beautiful new dressing room.
He wants to make you a star.
- Oh!
Harold, don' t be ridicu --
I sawyou together!
It' s nothing.
It' s just an infatuation.
It' s -- It' s nothing.
The "infatuation" will end.
Go to the boy.
Tell him it' s over.
The Duke is expecting you in the tower at 8: 00.
This very moment
For I' ve never known
Completeness
Like being here
Wrapped in the warmth of you
[Whispers]
Why live life
From dream
And dread the day [Wheezing, Panting]
How could I know, - [Coughing]
[Coughs]
[Gasps, Coughs]
and stronger than love... had begun to take hold of Satine.
Where is she?
Do you think she' il be up and about by tonight?
- Tomorrow morning.
Confessing?
What kind of imbecile do you take me for, Zidler?
She suddenly had a terrible desire... to go to a priest and -- and confess her sins.
- What?
- She wanted to be cleansed ofher former life.
She looked upon tonight as her wedding night.
She looked upon tonight as her wedding night.
- Her wedding night?
- She' s like a blushing bride.
She says you make her feel like a... virgin.
Virgin?
You know.
Touched... for the very first time.
The first --
Like a virgin.
- Gonna give you all her love - Give you all her love
- Like a virgin - [Waiters]
- When your hearts beat both in time - Oooh!
- A- Aaah!
Makes me strong Yes, she makes me bold
Harold Zidler' s brilliant lies had once again averted disaster.
But no lie, however brilliant, could save Satine.
Monsieur Zidler, Mademoiselle Satineis dying.
She has consumption.
My little sparrow is dying?
She mustn' t know, Marie.
The show must go on.
[Coughs]
Where were you last night?
I told you.
I was sick.
You don' t have to lie to me.
We have to end it.
Everyone knows.
Harold knows.
Sooner or later the Duke will find out too.
On opening night, I have to sleep with the Duke.
- [Whispers]
Christian.
- Then I' il write a song.
We' il put it in the show, and no matter how bad things get or whatever happens, whenever you hear it or when you sing it or whistle it or hum it, then you' il know it' il mean that we love one another.
- I won' t get jealous.
- Things don' t work that way, Christian.
We have to end it.
[Sighs]
I could feel like this
Like I' ve never seen the sky
Want to vanish
We could take it from your line, Satine.
So let' s take it --
We must be careful.
- Fear not.
Seasons may change
But I love you
Until the end
Come what may
I will love you
Until my dying
Suddenly the world
Seems such a perfect place
A little frog!
Suddenly it moves
It all revolves
[Christian, Satine]
And there' s no mountain too high
Sing out this song
Storm clouds may gather
And stars may collide
- Until the end - Until the end [Together]
Come what may
The magical sitar player falls from the roof and says,
"The greatest thing you' il ever learn... is just to love and be loved in return."
This ending' s silly.
Why would the courtesan go for the penniless writer?
Whoops!
[Orchestra]
I don' t like this ending.
Don' t like the ending, my dear Duke?
Why would the courtesan choose a penniless sitarplayer... over the maharajah, who is offering a lifetime of security?
That' s real love.
Once the sitarplayer has satisfied his lust, he will leave the courtesan with nothing.
I suggest that in the end the courtesan choose the maharajah.
B- But, sorry --
Sorry, but that ending does not uphold the bohemian ideals of truth, beauty, freedom --
I don' t care about your ridiculous dogma!
Why shouldn' t the courtesan choose the maharajah?
Because she doesn' t love you!
H- Him.
H- Him.
Sh- She doesn' t love h -- She doesn' t love him.
Oh, I see.
Monsieur Zidler, this ending will be rewritten... with the courtesan choosing the maharajah... and without the lovers' secret song.
It will be rehearsed in the morning, ready for the opening tomorrow night.
M- My dear Duke, th- that' il be quite impossible.
Harold!
The poor Duke is being treated appallingly.
These silly writers let their imaginations run away with them.
Now, why don' t you and I... have a little supper, and then afterwards... we canlet Monsieur Zidler know... how we would prefer the story to end.
Thank you, Elizabeth.
[Sighs]
He could destroy everything.
It' s for us.
You promised.
[Sighs]
It will be all right.
Yes, it will.
- He' s waiting.
- No.
No.
What may
Come what may.
[Christian]
She had gone to the tower to save us all, and for our part... we could do nothing but wait.
- [Cough]
Don' t worry, Shakespeare.
You' il get your ending once the Duke gets his... end in.
- Hey, hey!
Nini!
No!
- You keep your hands off me!
Never fall in love with a woman who sells herself.
It always ends bad!
The boy has a ridiculous obsession with me.
I mean, I indulge his fantasy because he' s talented.
We need him, but only until tomorrow night.
We have a dance...
in the brothels of Buenos Aires.
It tells the story...
- of a prostitute...
and a man... who falls in love... with her.
First there is desire.
Then passion.
Then suspicion.
Jealousy!
Anger!
Betrayal!
Without trust, there is no love!
Jealousy.
Roxanne
Roxanne
- His hand - [Sighs]
Caress your skin
To leave me
And please
Oh, and -- and the ending?
- Roxanne - Why
No.
No?
Oh, I see.
[Sighs, Sobs]
My dear Duke --
Silence!
You made me believe that you loved me.
No.
I couldn' t.
I couldn' t.
- I couldn' t go through with it.
I saw you there and I --
I felt differently, and I couldn' t pretend.
And the Duke, he saw.
He saw, and he -- [Continues Sobbing]
Christian, I love you.
It' s okay.
I couldn' t deal with it.
I didn' t want to pretend anymore.
I didn' t want to lie.
I don' t --
And he knows.
- He knows, and he saw you.
- That' s all right.
You don' t have to pretend anymore.
We' il leave.
We' il leave tonight.
Leave?
Wh --
Wh -- The show?
Wh --
I don' t care.
I don' t care about the show.
We have each other, and that' s all that matters.
Yes.
As long as we have each other.
- Wehave each other.
- Chocolat.
Take Miss Satine to her dressing room and get the things she needs.
- Noone must see you.
Do you understand?
- I understand.
- [Giggles]
It' s the boy.
He -- He has bewitched her with words.
I want her back, Zidler.
Find her -- [Winces]
Tell her... that the show will end my way... and she will come to me when the curtain falls, or I' il have the boy killed.
Killed?
Killed.
Forgive the intrusion, cherub.
You' re wasting your time, Harold.
Stop it.
You don' t understand.
The Duke is going to kill Christian.
No.
The Duke is insanely jealous.
Unless you do his ending and sleep with him tomorrow night, the Duke will have Christian killed.
[Sniffs]
He can' t scare us.
He' s a powerful man.
- [Grunts]
- What are you doing?
I don' t need you anymore!
All my life you' ve made me believe I was only worth what someone would pay for me!
But Christian loves me.
He loves me, and that is worth everything.
We' re going away from you, away from the Duke, away from the Moulin Rouge!
Good- bye, Harold.
You' re dying, Satine.
You' re dying.
Another trick, Harold?
No, my love.
The doctor told us.
Marie?
I' m dying.
To
A fool
Believe
Yes, it all
[Zidler]
Send Christian away.
[Bird Chirping]
He' il fight for me.
Yes, unless he believes you don' t love him.
What?
You' re a great actress, Satine.
[Inhales]
No.
Use your talent to save him.
Hurt him.
Hurt him to save him.
There is no other way.
The show must go on, Satine.
We' re creatures of the underworld.
Today' s
On the stage
I' il top the bill I' il earn the kill
On with the
On with the
On with the
[Zidler]
On with the show!
What' s wrong?
I' m staying with the Duke.
After I left you, the Duke came to see me... and he offered me everything.
Everything that I' ve ever dreamed of.
He has one condition.
I must never see you again.
- I' m sorry.
- What are you talking about?
- You knew who I was.
- What about last night, what we said?
I don' t expect you to understand.
The difference between you and I is that you can leave any time you choose.
But this is my home.
- The Moulin Rouge is my home.
- No.
There must be something else.
[Gasping, Panting]
There' s something the matter.
Tell me what it is.
Tell me what' s wrong!
- Tell me the truth!
Tell me the truth!
The truth?
[Thunder Crashing, Rumbling]
That' s how the story really ends.
Jealousy has driven him mad!
Satine!
Satine!
Satine!
Things aren' t always as they seem.
Things are exactly the way they seem.
Christian, you may see me only as a drunken, vice- ridden gnome... whose friends are just pimps and girls from the brothels, but I know about art and love... if only because I long for it with every fiber of my being.
She loves you.
I know it.
I know she loves you.
Go away, Toulouse.
Leave me alone.
Go away.
Go away!
I wanted to shut out what Toulouse had said, but he had filled me with doubt.
[DoorShuts]
And there was only one way to be sure.
I had to know.
So I returned... to the Moulin Rouge... one...
last... time. time.
She' s mine!
I only speak the truth I only speak the truth
I only speak the truth!
- Bravo!
Bravo!
She is mine.
She is mine.
I know she still loves him.
There' s got to be a reason.
How about one of them is a duke and the other --
But what?
But what?
- [Coughing]
- of our sacred --
What a magnificent performance.
A little bit more for me.
Come on, lovey.
That' s a girl.
The boy' s here.
I told Satine that if Christian were to come near her, he would be killed!
He very soon will be.
- He will be killed.
That' s it.
That' s why she' s pushing him away -- to save him.
That' s it, that' s it.
Christian!
No!
Aaah!
Oh, God, this is high up!
- I' ve come to pay my bill.
You shouldn' t be here, Christian.
Just leave.
Killed.
Killed?
Killed!
- I must warn him!
- You made me believe that you loved me.
Why shouldn' t I pay you?
- Please, Christian.
She' s got to get on the stage!
Jealousy has driven the sitarplayer into hiding!
- You did your job so very well.
- Persian army, go!
The boy' s taken Satine.
Quick.
[Panting]
Don' t, Christian.
There' s no point. Just leave.
- [Continues Panting]
- They' il kill him!
The poor boy!
But I have found them!
- [Screams]
- [Stage Manager]
Get up, boy!
- If it wasn' t real, then why can' t I pay you?
- Let the palace doors be opened.
Christian!
Christian!
Open the doors!
Let me pay!
Let me pay!
- Open the doors!
- Tell me it wasn' t real!
- Tell me you don' t love me!
- Open the doors!
- Tell me you don' t love me!
- Christian!
Tell me you don' t love me!
What' s going on?
I am not fooled!
Though he has shaved off his beard and adopts a disguise, mine eyes do not lie.
For it is he, the same penniless sitar player!
- Driven mad by jealousy!
Oh, Lord.
No!
This woman is yours now.
- I' ve paid my whore.
I owe you nothing.
And you are nothing to me.
[Whispers]
I can' t remember my line.
This sitar player... doesn' t love you.
See, he flees the kingdom!
Pumpkin, it' s for the best.
You know it is.
The show must go on.
And now, my bride, it is time foryou to raise your voice to the heavens... and say your wedding vows.
- Sing to our gods your -- - I' ve got it.
I' ve got it!
Christian!
I will love you
- Until my dying - Christian.
He' s got a gun!
- Aah!
- Shut up!
- Look, he' s got a gun!
- Guards, seize them!
- He' s a mad man!
Vive la vie de boheme!
All right!
No problem!
- Until my - My way!
My way!
Stand by for curtain call!
Dancers, positions, please.
- Satine!
[Coughing]
Are you all right?
- [Wheezing, Gasping]
What' s the matter?
God.
Somebody get some help!
Hold the curtain!
Fetch the doctor!
I' m sorry, Christian.
I --
- Shh.
I' m so sorry.
You' il be allright.
You' il be allright.
Cold.
I' m co --
Cold.
Hold me.
Hold me.
You' re okay.
I love you.
You' ve got to go on, Christian.
Can' t go on without you, though.
You' ve got so much to give.
Tell --
Tell our story, Christian.
No.
Yes.
Promise me.
Promise me.
Yes.
Yes.
I' il always be with you.
[Applause]
A very strange
Enchanted
[Christian]
Days turned into weeks.
Weeks turned into months.
And then one not so very special day,
I went to my typewriter,
I sat down... and I wrote our story.
A story about a time, a story about a place, a story about the people.
But above all things, a story about love.
A love... that will live... forever.
The... end.
[Christian]
You' il ever learn
And be loved
Promise me you won' t sleep with an Italian, baby.
Darling, what are you saying?
- Nor with an American hippie.
- No, it' s disgusting!
Nor with a pretty little French guy.
Nope!
And not even with a Mexican selling bracelets...
-... in the Cote D' Azur.
- Oh, Tenoch.
- With nobody.
- Of course not.
- Promise me.
- I promise.
- What?
- Come on, you know!
I know what?
I promise...... I won' t even sleep...... with a Chinese.
- I' m not joking!
- Don' t you trust me, Tenoch?
- Yes.
- So what?
- Well, promise.
- And you?
I promise, too.
Let' s hear it.
- But we do it together.
- Together.
One...... two...... three.
I promise I...... won' t sleep with... - a Brazilian.
- A German.
- An Argentinean.
- A Polish. - one from Sonora.
- Irish.
- Or from Guasave.
- Your father.
Are you crazy?
Ana' s mother, a divorced French woman, a teacher...... at the Foreigners Institute...... didn' t object about Tenoch sleeping with her daughter.
It was different for Julio.
He stayed with Cecilia until dinner, and came back the next morning.
It wasn' t noticeable, but Cecilia' s father, an allergy specialist...... feared that her relationship with Julio went too far beyond.
Her mother, a psychologist...... saw it positively, as an innocent thing.
- She can' t find her passport!
- Then she' s gonna miss the plane!
Julio!
Help me looking for the passport!
- Be quick, we' re in a hurry!
- Yes, yes.
Did you take the car out?
- Shut the door!
- And the passport?
It' s here, you stupid.
Come on!
Quick.
- What a nice greeting.
Oh, yeah!
Hey.
What are you gonna do tonight, going to the party?
No, I' il feel lonely without you...... I already know I' m gonna miss you an awful lot.
- Come on!
- Cecilia!
- Your mother!
- Come, come!
I wanna take a bit of you inside me.
The plane' s gonna leave you on land, honey!
Move!
Move!
Found it?
- Here it is!
- Good.
How are you?
- Have you seen Esteban?
- No, I haven' t.
Ana, do the check- in!
How' s it going, charrolastra?
What a farewell party, huh?
Let' em go.
I' m gonna miss her, but here we are.
Bye bye.
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, how' s it going?
Why are you so pale?
Nevermind.
- Wonderful!
- Hi, dad!
How are you!
Ana' s father was a journalist, recently converted to politics.
He was the director of the Institute of Culture in Mexico City.
He had a liking for Tenoch...... but with his Party mates...... and never in front of Ana, he called him "the young lad".
- Let' s go.
- I wish I was already there.
- Don' t go.
- I' il miss you, my love.
- I don' t want to leave, honey.
- Ana!
Smell of bread.
Oh, fuck!
Damn hog!
Get the hell off my ass!
A gift for the promotion.
Fuck off!
Go to hell, hog!
Stop, cut it out.
Don' t be a child.
Did your father get pissed?
No.
He got angry.
If I don' t take Economics, I can forget the car.
Being left without "Murciègalo"...
- only for not willing to study?
- I hate economists!
They can all go fuck themselves.
- What an idiot.
- No way.
I wanna be a writer.
Come with me at Literature.
No, I pass.
Fucking traffic!
I bet Boinas is there demonstrating.
It' s her right, charrolastra.
And it' s my right to tell' em they' re sons of a bitch.
True.
But there are always nice chicks at those demonstrations, huh?
That' s for sure.
Do you wear perfume?
Holy shit!
You' re the hog!
Open it!
- Open it!
- There' s the safe lock.
Open it, asshole!
That day, three demonstations took place.
But the jam had been caused by a pedestrian having been struck.
Marcelino Escutia, an immigrant carpenter from Michoacàn.
Marcelino was hit by a truck at high speed.
He never used the pedestrian bridge...... because it forced him to walk 2 more km. to get to the building yard.
His unidentified body was recovered... and brought to the mortuary.
It was claimed 4 days later.
Tenoch was the second of three sons of a Harvard economist...... Subsecretary of State...... and of a housewife attending esoteric courses and activities.
They decided to name Tenoch "Hernàn"...... but then his father took a job for the government... and hit by nationalism...... he named his son "Tenoch", an Aztec name.
I' il roll this joint and we' re off.
I' ve brought some stuff from San Francisco.
It' s a charm!
- Uncut pills.
- Really?
Go with the trip!
If I see Miriam I' il bite her tits and fuck her hung by her ears!
- What a chick!
- Hell, yeah!
She rubbed herself on me at Rata' s party.
Really, what a slut!
I wanna make Sazòn' s woman.
What an ass and what tits!
Yeah, Sazòn' s woman is outstanding.
Oh, not here, assshole.
On the terrace!
- The smell is the same.
- It stinks, dude!
- Nicely damp, isn' t it?
- Don' t be an asshole.
- Dry.
- Of course.
Monkey stuff.
A strong joint.
Tenoch!
My mother.
- Hello, madam.
How are you?
- Hi, Julio.
- Hi, mom.
- Honey!
What' s up, kids?
You look weird.
Are you a bit sad?
It' s for the girls, right?
Come on, boys!
Love has upset you all!
Think of them, and you' il be with them.
- Are you coming at Jessica' s wedding?
- How could I miss.
You' il have to dress elegantly.
There will be the president, too.
Tenoch, throw that cigarette.
Hello, madam.
Your garden rocks.
- Saba, I didn' t know you were here, too.
- I' m everywhere.
At the party, Julio and Tenoch used alcohol and marijuana...... and the ecstasy from San Francisco.
Their conquering plans failed.
They were afraid that their failure could mark their summer destiny.
At 4 AM Julio threw up on the road.
At 5, Tenoch broke a car' s lamp going back home...
The same night...... Saba had his first group sex experience.
A week passed by
For Julio and Tenoch, boredom became routine.
Tenoch' s father was a shareholder of a sporting club...... so his son could get in on monday, the closing day.
One, two, three.
You were breathless' cause you had just smoked.
The pro.
You only gave me two meters.
10 at least, asshole.
- Four, at best.
- Two and a half.
You always exaggerate.
Hey, I don' t want to exaggerate, but...... you got a really ugly cock
It looks like a hooded monk...
Then get on your knees.
Confess yourself!
Don' t be a queer!
Six, seven...... eight, nine, ten, eleven.
- More bodyguards than guests.
- Count them.
3 for the Comonforts, 3 for the Guerreros.
Don' t point.
My father' s boss got two, like that government guy.
- Plus all the Major State.
- Add Herminio, won' t you?
- No, he' s my driver.
- But he' s armed.
Looks like our Tenoch is pretty drunk.
Dad, I' ve greeted the president.
The Gonzales Bocanegras are looking for you.
Please, behave with them.
They' ve always been so nice with you.
All right, dad.
Do you remember the fatty girl?
How are you?
It' s been a century!
You see?
What are you doing?
What a bunch of assholes, huh?
- As you say, sir.
- Hey, buddy.
Do me a Mil lslas.
Pretty loaded.
Do you remember your cousin, Tenoch?
He wants to be a writer, too.
You' il have a lot of things to tell.
- Cheers.
- Cheers, aunt.
Thanks.
- What a lady, huh?
- Yes.
How are you, baby?
The last time, you were a child...... crying for the Ninja Turtles.
- It was a ThunderCat.
- Sorry, a ThunderCat.
So you want to tell stories about children?
No, stories about morons like you.
Writing in high school is one thing, literature is another one.
- When are you starting?
- Did you read my book?
- I' ve read the critics.
- Critics are all assholes!
Alejandro Montes de Oca, "Jano", was Tenoch' s cousin.
His father died when he was 3.
He was committed to his aunt.
He managed to escape abroad with a master course.
He had just returned after 10 years.
Think well.
Do you really want to be a writer?
It' s full of writers, but the good ones are few.
It takes a life to become one.
My cousin, the writer.
It' s not just discipline and improving your technique.
No, you need a personal style, too.
You must have lived a lot.
Let' s be honest, What have you lived?
Yes, Tenoch, what experience do you have?
Fuck, guys!
Sorry, sorry.
Are you all right?
I wish...... to thank you all...... for your presence at this humble celebration.
And especially...... the president of the republic and his charming lady...... who have shared with us...... this important moment for Jessica and Francisco...... in spite of their duties.
It' s really... a sensitive act.
In front of such illustrious guests...... I want to wish the newly weds the most absolute happiness.
Damn, what a beauty.
Hello.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Aren' t you bored of this all?
- No.
- Not even a little bit?
- Pardon.
- Well, a little bit.
- Yes?
- But where are you from?
- Madrid, Spain.
- And what are you doing here?
- My husband is one of the relatives.
- Of the groom?
- No, of the bride.
Did you see what they' ve done to me?
Yes, you, fuck!
Luisa Cortés was left an orphan when 10 because of a car accident.
She was grown by her grand- aunt...... a franchist who fell sick and was taken care of by Luisa in her last 5 years of life.
Luisa always lived with her.
At 20 she married Jano.
Months later, the grand- aunt died, and Luisa lost her last relative.
- What happened?
- Those assholes.
How can I introduce you to the president?
Let' s do it another time.
- No, let' s go.
- With a bit of salt...
- Salt.
- Let' s look for another suit.
- Jano, don' t do this to me.
- Attention.
- Take care of my mother.
- Hey.
Is he your husband?
- Yes, why?
- He' s my cousin.
His cousin.
- What' s your name?
- Me?
Tenoch.
- Tenoch?
- Yes.
Tenoch, the little dwarf?
I saw you before getting married.
You were a little puppy.
You wanted a Thundercat.
Good memory.
- Do you smoke?
- Thanks.
- You' re pretty grown up.
- Thanks.
When did you arrive?
Almost a month ago.
Jano will keep lessons at the university.
From September.
Are you going on holiday?
He' s going to Villahermosa with other scholars.
- I stay doing job colloquies.
- Sure.
If there' s time, I' d like to go to the sea.
And you?
- We are going to the sea.
- In Puerto Escondido?
- Jano talked to me a lot about it.
- Puerto?
No, it sucks.
Isn' t it a beautiful place?
Only hip guys and 4th rate surfers go there.
There are only fishermen where we go.
And what' s its name?
What' s its name?
- Heaven' s Mouth.
Heaven' s Mouth, sure.
- It' s wonderful!
- A paradise!
Practically heaven made sea.
Tropical.
A bite of heaven, on earth.
A paradise on earth, with roots...
- You could come with us Yeah, come with us!
Me?
- Would you take me with you?
- Heck, sure.
- Of course.
- Is there room to sleep?
Yes, on a bed of sand, warm and smooth...
-... under a starry sky.
- In luxury.
There' s coconut there, and then we carry some caguàmas.
- Caguàmas?
- Beer.
Jano will like it.
The mariachis.
The president left one hour later.
He had a meeting...... with the Executive Committee for the electoral candidates choice.
The next morning, at 10...
He shown disappointment for the Cerro Verde massacre...... denying that the governor of the state knew anything about it.
After expressing his condolences...... he flew to Seattle for a world summit on globalization.
The days passed by, and while Jano was away because of his meeting...... Luisa got some test results from her doctor.
In the waiting room, she took a test on a magazine, named:
"Are you a satisfied woman?"
In the first question, Luisa picked answer B:
"I prefer to be awake rather than sleeping and dreaming".
In the 4th, C:
"I value time more than power or money".
In the 7th, A:
"I think about today rather than yesterday or tomorrow".
She scored 16 points.
The magazine found her afraid to claim her freedom.
Luisa didn' t agree.
Think about Conchita' s tits.
Those stiff and hard nipples.
Excellent.
And Mayela' s pussy?
All wet and hairy.
- Your girlfriend' s mother.
- Shut up.
The 2nd grade teacher?
- Yes, Mrs. Georgina.
- She turned me on.
- Salma Hayek!
- Yeah, Salmita!
- Hey, your cousin.
- What cousin?
The Spanish one!
Yes?
Hello?
- Honey?
- Jano.
Are you fine?
It' s just that...
I' m drunk, Luisa.
Then go to sleep.
We' il talk tomorrow.
I' il be back in two days.
- I love you an awful lot..
- Me too, Jano.
I' m an idiot.
I swear.
I' m crap.
You' re drunk.
Sleep.
I' m an asshole.
A piece of shit.
Calm down.
What' s wrong?
- Are you fine, honey?
- It' s just that...
It' s just that...... I' ve slept with a woman.
Can you see I' m crap?
Luisa?
Why are you telling me this?
I love you an awful lot!
Why are you telling me this?
Here' s your sandwich, darling.
- With your favorite cheese.
- Thanks.
Hello?
One moment, please.
It' s for you, Tenoch.
Who is it?
I' m Luisa.
The Spanish.
Oh, hello!
How are you?
I' m glad I' ve found you.
You said you were leaving today.
- To go where?
- To Heaven' s Mouth, right?
Yes, we' re leaving today.
- Are you ready yet?
- Well, we' re sorting things out.
- Listen, a question...
- What?
Is your invitation still valid?
Hello?
- Well...
- I guess it isn' t.
- It' s ok, nevermind.
- Wait.
Yes, yes.
- Nevermind, I don' t want to bother.
- No, it' s fine.
Where shall we pick you?
I live in Calle Machu Picchu, at 52.
Third floor, intern C, like cheese.
Hello?
Are you sleeping, fucking lazy- bones?
I' ve been awake 'till 3 watching tapes.
- Hurry up, we' re going to the beach.
- What?
To Heaven' s Mouth.
- But it doesn' t exist.
- I know, but Luisa wants to go there.
- What Luisa?
- Luisa.
- Are you joking?
Really?
- Really.
Fetch Betsabé.
It won' t make it.
The radiator and the battery are screwed.
And it' s my sister' s turn to use it.
Let' s go with Murciègalo.
My father took it off me because of the broken lamp.
What an asshole.
Julio Zapata lived with his mother and his sister.
He hadn' t seen his father since when he was 5.
His mother had always been a secretary in a corporation.
His sister Manuela, known as "Boinas"...... studied Political Sciences At the National University.
After a long negotiation, Julio had the car for 5 days...... in exchange for 3 weeks...... during which Boinas would go to Chiapas to distribute provisions.
- Beer!
- Beer, beer, beer.
Here' s the beer.
One, two..
For three!
Condoms!
- Aren' t there any of your size?
- It' s the men' s sector.
Beware, dude.
After Puebla, get off the highway.
- The landscape is a real riot.
- Yeah, that way.
Then, once you' re here, go this way.
Damn.
Saba, you fool, that' s a river!
You' re going towards Veracruz!
No, towards Oaxaca.
Quiet, then you go this way...
Careful, right?
There are traffic control posts.
If you got weed stuff it In your balls, understood?
- Saba, we' re in a hurry.
- Yes, be quick.
Then you get to this small village...... there' s a hut with a giant Coca- Cola bottle on the top.
- Saba, and then what?
- Yeah, then?
What?
- The beach, ugly fool!
- Yeah, the beach.
Turn left on a country lane, and you' re on the beach.
That' s all.
Yes?
I' il come down immediately.
Give it to me, I' il help you.
Be quiet, it' s my car.
- You haven' t told us what you do for a living.
- What do you think?
- A sociologist.
- Cold.
Philosopher?
No, cold.
- Psychologist.
- Really?
- Lingerie model.
- Frost!
We surrender.
I have a degree in odontology.
- What' s that? - she dries your drooling, at the dentist.
- Really?
- Really?
- Why such a choice?
- I didn' t make it.
I never played with dolls...... or pretended to be a dentist.
- Why then?
- I was 16, my aunt fell sick...... and I had to find a job.
4 months later I had a degree.
- But did you want to do something else before?
- I didn' t do well at school.
I had a fixed idea:
I wanted to travel.
- Travelling is super cool.
- Eh, yes.
- You' ve never been on a plane!
- What do you mean?
- Well, only three planes.
- So what?
And so I would be a philosopher?
- You look like someone who thinks.
- Of course, you' re Jano' s wife.
Luisa often attended to intellectuals' dinners with Jano.
She never integrated herself with them.
There was always someone willing to involve her...... or expose her...... giving her the word in the middle of a discussion.
Humbly, she used to answer:
"I don' t know anything about these things".
Sometimes, she would have wanted to ask them...... to list the names of all the teeth one by one.
She never did it.
Charrolastra, pass me the chips.
What' s charro...
- Charrolastra?
What' s it?
A mix of charol astrale and charro lastre.
- Cool, isn' t it?
- Very.
Daniel didn' t know the words of an english song and used to sing:
Charrolastra, charrolo
Charrolastra, charrolo
According to Saba...... it refers to the dead weight we are for your father.
So Daniel and Saba are charrolastras, too?
Lately Saba has been taken by the investigation of...... the altered states of his expanded conscience.
- In a mystical phase?
- No, dope.
- He' s out of mind.
- We see Daniel less and less.
- Every day he' s more queer.
- Is that why you don' t see him?
He wants to frequent different companies.
But we' re still brothers.
Pecas is just a honorary member...... because she has terrible boyfriends.
- She didn' t sign our manifesto.
- Manifesto?
Tell me something.
- No.
- It' s secret.
- I won' t tell anyone.
- We' d be forced to kill you.
One: there' s no greater honor than being a charrolastra.
Two: to each his own.
Three: pop killed the poetry.
- Four: a joint a day.
- Saba' s idea.
Five: don' t fuck with the others' girlfriends.
Six:
America' s supporters are queers.
- Seven: death to the morals.
Eight: forbidden to get married as a virgin.
- Nine:
Club America' s supporters...
- You' ve already said that.
It' s repeated because they' re queers twice.
Crappy team.
Ten: the truth is cool but unreachable.
The truth is the best, but it' s very hard to reach.
Eleven: whoever breaks one of the rules previously stated...... loses his title of charrolastra.
Take your manifesto to the parliament and it will be a success.
But it' s cool, isn' t it?
Don' t the charrolastras eat?
Julio and Tenoch told her many other tales.
Each story proved the strong ties... that joined them, they were like one.
The stories, although enriched with personal mythology, were true.
But like it always happens, they were incomplete truths.
Julio didn' t say that he used to light matches to cover the smell in the toilet... in Tenoch' s house...... nor Tenoch revealed that he used to lift the toilet cover with his foot at Julio' s.
There was no need to know those details.
- Do you have girlfriends?
- Yes, Ceci.
- Ana Bananas.
- Bananas?
And where are them?
In Europe.
They' re thick as thieves.
- Where in Europe?
- Around Italy.
They' re lucky.
- They say it' s wonderful.
- Yes, but that' s not why.
- Why?
- Why did they go to Italy?
- For the clothes?
- On holiday?
For the guys!
Italian guys are hot!
- What are you saying?
You don' t know them.
- Right.
Ceci wouldn' t be able to betray me.
She wanted to tattoo my name on her tit.
- But her mother didn' t want her to.
- I took Ana' s cherry.
- She only does it with me.
- Exactly.
I' m pleased.
Your girlfriends are lucky for having boyfriends like you.
And are you charrolastras faithful?
- Of course.
That' s how it gotta be.
Have you ever betrayed Jano?
Me?
Betraying Jano?
No, I' d never do that.
- I' m so hungry...
- Here comes the lady.
Has he ever betrayed you?
Jano always needed confirmations.
Do you think so?
- Has he betrayed you?
- Some beer.
- Me too.
- Where did you meet him?
- In a bar in Madrid.
- Really?
I bet he was drunk.
No, he was sober.
I was the totally drunk one.
- Really?
- Yep.
- And then?
- And then?
This guy, so arrogant and bold...... comes to me and goes:
- "Hey, what a chick you are!" - What did you see in him?
Really, what did you see?
Well, I don' t know.
Jano and me share a lot of things.
Like?
Well...
He has no father and I' m an orphan
His mother was annoying...... like the aunt I used to live with.
Those 5 years when I took care of her were terrible.
Jano was the only one to be on my side.
- Shall we toast?
- Sure!
To relax.
- So what will you have?
- I don' t know.
Thanks.
Good night.
Good night.
- Hey, pal!
- The small one for you.
- Easy, huh?
- Fuck, yes.
- Hey.
- What' s up?
Will Ana and Ceci make some Italians?
- No, what are you saying?
- Ah, it' s full of pee here.
- No, huh?
- Absolutely not.
And then Italians are queers.
Sure.
D' ya think the little cousin' s gonna screw us?
- Looks like Jano cheats on her.
- Heavy stuff, huh?
We gotta comfort her.
Make her smile a bit.
I' il show you.
Come.
Hi guys.
I' m coming.
- What' s up?
- Are you awake?
Come on, the beach' il run away!
- Fuck, come on!
- Julio, the beach.
Now?
- The after- breakfast, cool.
- Go this way.
- Can you drive like that?
- Yes.
You don' t feel bends.
We fly like the Concorde.
Monkey shit.
Pure shit.
- Good stuff.
- Sure.
Good.
- D' you smoke a lot?
- So and so.
You?
- No.
- Want a beer?
Tenoch didn' t know Tepelmeme...... birthplace of Leodegaria Victoria, Leo, his nanny.
At 13 she had moved to Mexico City.
Leo found a job at lturbide' s house, and took care of Tenoch since his birth.
Until he was 4 years old, he called her "mom".
Tenoch didn' t comment.
There' s something for everyone.
I saw you tonight.
- What?
- What?
- You know what I' m talking about.
- No, about what?
D' you think you' re supposed to spy on a woman in a hotel?
It was his idea.
Ah, yes?
And you followed him.
- Did you want to see me naked?
- No.
- And get a good hand- job.
- Come on.
Tell me one thing:
Did you make love with many other women?
- Some.
- Stop it, you boaster.
- What.
- He' s only fucked with his girlfriend.
- See that you' re wrong.
- With whom then?
- With Flavia.
- Fuck off!
Never.
The idiot came while he was still putting the condom on.
- You told me.
- What?
A little offer for the queen?
And you, Tenoch?
- What?
- Have you made love with others...... apart from your girlfriend?
- Some.
- Yes, 2 or three hookers.
- Hookers?
- Whores.
- Really?
Do you go with whores?
The little queen is gorgeous.
- I don' t go with whores.
- You do.
- You' re a whore- chaser.
- No.
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!
- Wonderful!
- Turn it up!
Did you fuck many guys before Jano?
I started late and met Jano soon.
- Were you a virgin?
- A virgin?
No.
There was a guy before.
Did he bang you hard?
Tell us the truth, and go, go, go!
To be honest, yes.
He took me to the factory where his uncle worked.
I was dying with fear, I barely knew him.
I thought he wanted to kiss me.
No, instead...... he took my cherry.
- The bastard.
- He hurt me a real lot.
I said "I won' t do it again".
But we always ended up doing it in a row.
I thought he only wanted to screw.
But he also wanted to talk.
- He fell in love with me.
- Sure...
He used to pick me up on his bike...... in a leather jacket.
He was fascinating.
I was charmed.
I always played hooky any time I could.
Playing hooker, like doing blow jobs and stuff?
Yes, that, too.
No, playing hooky means cutting school classes.
I used to cut classes to spend more time with him...... in the park, or to take a good ride on his bike.
We were even about to go to the Cote D' Azur.
Me too.
A friend of his had found me a job as a waitress.
We had everything packed and ready.
He had a pigtail and a broken tooth.
And an earring on the right.
I was in love with him, I swear.
Deeply in love.
- Then Jano came, right?
- No.
- So what?
- Dead in a bike accident.
Heck.
He was 17.
Had they passed by there 10 years earlier...... they would have ran across a couple of cages in the middle of the road.
Then across a cloud of white feathers.
Shortly after, more crushed cages, with dying chickens.
Later on, an overturned truck, surrounded with smoke.
They' d have seen two inert bodies on the ground...... the smaller one covered with a jacket...... and a hopeless woman crying on his side.
Another cigarette.
- Nice song, dude.
- The battery is down.
Turn on the radio.
Shit.
- Hide all the stuff.
- Don' t worry.
- Calm.
- Don' t stare at them.
Damn, those are fucked.
Don' t look, pal.
What the hell' s going on, dude?
Hey, not a bad crotch.
That woke up both of you.
Must have been the heat?
- Got a hard- on, sucked?
- You don' t know how much.
- He' s got a super small one.
- Small, dork?
Teodoro is 5 millimeters shorter than your Rasputin.
Bullshit.
- Did you measure them?
- Yes.
- But his one is horrible?
- How horrible?
- Hooded.
- Come on.
So beautiful!
- What?
- Seen?
- It sucks, it' s disgusting.
How do you make love with them?
- Sweetly, with feeling.
- Yeah, with jiribilla.
With what?
With affection.
- What do you exactly do to them?
- First, some groping warms the oven.
Some kisses on her titties and some nibbles on her nipples.
And then?
- Then I stick it all in.
- With jiribilla.
And then?
I push 'till she' s dying.
- Nothing else?
- What do you mean?
Ceci waves, shakes, moans, like an oyster with lemon.
- Ana cries.
- Oh, poor darling.
- No, she cries with pleasure.
- I figure it.
- Do you do it missionary style?
- Missionary, doggy- style, everything.
Ana likes to be on top.
And sitting, too.
And a good 69, as well.
All the Kamasutra.
All of it?
- I do everything.
And what about that thing when you put a finger in...
-... in the ass?
- In the ass?
Oh, fuck!
Go get some water!
Some water!
- I told ya.
- Towards San Rafael.
- And how much does it take?
- It' il be ready tomorrow.
No, but thanks anyway.
- Nice sombrero.
- Yes, really nice.
You can keep it.
- Really?
- Yes.
- Is it a gift?
- Yes.
Thanks.
It looks good on me.
Here' s the coconut.
- Thanks.
- Sorry.
That' s my name.
Beautiful name, Luisita.
Hi, Jano.
I know you' re not back yet.
I' m calling cause I didn' t leave any messages, not to make you worry.
I wanted to disappear from your life...... but I' ve understood it' s not right.
This is my message, but actually, I don' t know what to say.
I' ve met Lady Martina.
She' s 98 and she remembers everything since when she was 5.
Imagine all she has lived... and what we don' t live.
The mousse your mother sent us is in the fridge.
Pay the phone bill.
It' s on the desk.
Pick up your shirts from the laundry.
Careful, don' t wrinkle them.
Well, take care.
See you.
Pass me the shampoo.
Shampoo!
Please.
- Oh, I' m sorry.
- No, you can come in.
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
Must have been the heat, the trip, everything.
We wanted to ask you if you have some shampoo.
Did you bring it?
Take the towel off.
What?
I say take the towel off.
- The towel?
- Yes, the towel.
Take it off, Tenoch.
Don' t cover yourself.
Don' t cover yourself.
- You' re easily turned on, eh?
- Yeah, huh?
It' s on the left, you' ve lied to me.
- What?
- You said it hung on the right.
- Oh, yeah.
- I imagined it that way, you know.
Jerk off.
Jerk off?
- A hand job.
Touch yourself.
- No.
Do you want me to help you?
Do you want me to show you my tits?
I' il show them if you touch yourself.
Come here, Tenoch.
Closer.
I' m wet.
Wanna feel it?
- Yes.
- Touch me.
Touch me.
Lick me, Tenoch, lick me.
- But take my panties off.
- Sure, sure.
No, come here.
Oh, honey.
Honey.
- I' m sorry.
- It' s fine, it doesn' t matter.
Relax.
Julio didn' t know what he felt.
He only knew it wasn' t anger.
He was 8 years old the last time he had felt that way.
One night he had gone out drinking... and had found his mother in his godfather' s arms.
Julio had retired in silence...... and never told anyone about it.
How ware you, pal?
I' m here.
What about a little challenge?
- No, it' s all full of leaves.
- No problem.
Okay.
You' ve let me beat you.
You had no reason.
I made Ana.
What?
You' ve heard me.
I made your girlfriend.
The last time Tenoch had felt like that he was 11.
He head noticed his father' s picture on a newspaper accusing him...... of a fraud in the import of spoiled corn for the poor.
Tenoch and his parents moved to Vancouver for eight moths.
Tenoch never asked the reason.
Luisa didn' t know about Julio' s confession.
During dinner, though, she felt the tension between the two friends.
She sensed the broken equilibrium...... that she had to reestablish.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Good night, Tenoch.
What' s up?
- Don' t you sleep with Luisa?
- Fuck off.
How many times did you make her?
Only one, and I was drunk.
- When?
- Stop it.
When?
- I don' t know.
How' s it you don' t know?
While you were at Lake Tahoe.
- And where was Cecilia?
- She was sick.
Was it at her place?
- No.
- Where then?
- At a party.
- What party, asshole?
I don' t know, dude.
It was Fruity Loopy' s party, I guess.
The party when Saba took her cherry?
- I guess so?
- What are you laughing, asshole?
- Saba.
- Don' t laugh!
- Who started it?
- Both.
We were so fucking drunk.
And where did you do it?
In the sister' s room.
How was Ana dressed?
- Shit!
I can' t remember.
- Was she wearing pants or a skirt?
What panties was she wearing?
- What panties?
You' ve heard me!
- White, I guess.
- Did she take it in her mouth?
- No!
Look at me, idiot.
Did she suck it?
- Did you lick her?
- No, of course not.
- Did she come?
- How do I know?
It was very quick.
- Did she enjoy it?
- How could I know?
- And you, asshole, did you enjoy it?
- No, no.
I felt like shit, I swear.
I wanted to tell you...
To hell!
You' ve broken our friendship.
The trust!
You made my girlfriend.
You' ve screwed me!
And me, idiot, bringing you those fucking comics from Lake Tahoe.
And a shit of a dress for that whore of Ana, fuck!
Fuck off, dude.
Fuck off.
Tenoch, forgive me, pal.
I didn' t do it on purpose.
Not on purpose?
You can maybe stomp her foot not on purpose, not screw her!
Right?
Not make her!
- Not make her!
- No.
He went on all night long.
Tenoch engaged himself in an endless quest for details.
He wanted to make a puzzle with pieces that wouldn' t always match.
In the meanwhile, Julio melted some details to build a less painful truth.
Lady Martina gave Luisa the stuffed mouse with her name on it as a present.
It belonged to her grand- nephew Luisa Obregòn...... died of a sunstroke crossing the desert of Arizona...... looking for a better future.
Luisa believed that the dead kept being present.
She wondered how long she would live on in other people' s memories.
But she didn' t want to fill her mind with thoughts of death.
She heat has hit you, too?
A crazy heat.
Hey, where are you going?
- Stay here.
- I wanna see Rasputin.
Listen, I don' t like the idea.
Had Julio come into my room, it would have been the same.
Bullshit.
If you think I' m the driver, fuck yourselves.
Go fuck off!
Calm down!
Fucking hogs!
Me, me, me, me.
- The shoes.
- The what?
Shoes.
Okay, pull' em off.
Now...
... this way, this way, this way.
Come here!
Give it to me.
Come, feel me.
Be calm.
Quiet.
Look at me.
Look at me.
- Wait for me.
- Careful.
I' m sorry.
Nevermind.
Be quiet.
Luisa, I' m sorry.
It' s just that...
Don' t act this way, come on!
Wasn' t this what you wanted?
It was your game, right?
Taking me on a trip to fuck me, wasn' t it?
So what?
God, what idiots.
I shouldn' t have done it with none of you.
That' s what I should have done.
I didn' t want to hurt anyone.
Do you believe me?
- Do you forgive me?
- Yes, yes.
Let' s go.
Me too.
- You too, what?
- Julio.
Me too, asshole.
- You too what?
- I made your girlfriend, Ceci.
It' s not true.
- When?
- After the Plastilina Mosh gig.
Son of a bitch.
That' s why you brought me home first, right, asshole?
- Where?
- My place.
- Your place?
- In my room, dude.
- She had flowered panties.
- Did you screw her?
- The asshole made mine.
- What happened to Three?
Three:
Don' t fuck the others' girlfriends.
That' s Five!
Get out!
Get out, asshole!
Now I' il tear you to pieces!
- Open!
- Hey, guys, stop it!
Fuck...
A classic for a boor.
Now the boor' s gonna smash your face!
Blow me, dork!
- Fuck off!
- Snob queer!
- To hell.
- Julio listen...
Son of a bitch!
I thought you were different, but you' re animals!
The futile Manifesto!
Not following your own rules!
You mark your territory and quarrel but you just want to screw each other!
That' s what you like!
Who cares if you screw each other' s women, if you come immediately?
Who made me do this?
I' m here changing diapers.
Seen, asshole?
- Come on, get out, open!
- No.
- She' s leaving.
- You' ve pushed her.
How could you make my Ceci?
That whore!
- So we' re even, right?
- Even?
Not fucking even!
Get on your knees, like you made me do.
- Come on!
- I' m sorry.
- On your knees, son of a bitch!
- She' s looking for a lift.
I know, asshole!
On your knees!
Move away.
- Move away if you want me to get out.
- Here you go.
Come on, I won' t do anything.
Out.
Sorry.
On both your knees.
I beg your pardon, Julio, for screwing your girlfriend, okay?
Come on, idot, she' s leaving.
- How many times did you make her?
- Just once, what do you think?
You' re not a charrolastra anymore!
- You don' t mean anything to me anymore.
- You neither.
You' re a piece of shit!
- Come on, Luisa, get in.
- No.
I' il take a bus to Puerto Escondido!
To hell with you and Heaven' s Mouth.
We want to go there with you.
Why?
To quarrel.
No, thanks.
- We won' t quarrel.
- We promise.
I can picture myself, with two dorks.
- We' ve been assholes.
- We' il do as you say.
You command.
It' s a few steps from here! - it' s close, come on.
But we do as I say.
At the first quarrel, I' il go away.
As you say.
Now I' il set my rules.
I' il make my Manifesto.
You' ve gone beyond, Julio.
One:
I won' t fuck with any of you.
Fuck each other, if you wish.
Two:
I sunbathe naked and I don' t want you around and horny.
Three:
I choose the music.
Four:
You' re required to kindly shut up when I say so.
Five:
You cook.
Six:
Not another word on your poor girlfriends.
Seven:
Keep a distance of 6 meters.
If I prefer so, 100.
Eight:
You' il take care of all the labor.
Nine:
You' il speak only if you already agree.
But if you just shut up, it' s better.
And Ten:
It' s forbidden to contradict me.
And especially pushing me.
Julio and Tenoch didn' t know where they were...... or how to get to their destination.
Saba' s indications were contradictory.
Afraid that Luisa might found out, Julio took a country lane.
They thought Luisa was sleeping.
They didn' t know that her fear prevented her from doing so.
It had nothing to do with darkness or with what was surrounding her.
Hey!
We got ceviche...... fried fish and beer!
Jesus Carranza, known as "Chuy", and his wife Mabel...... the fourth generation of a fishermen family.
They lived there, close to San Bernabe.
Chuy offered himself to escort them to the beaches the next day.
He asked them 350 pesos, including lunch.
- Let me drive it!
- No.
- I know how to.
- Fine then.
- Don' t push it too much.
- I know, I know.
- Nice place to have a bath, that one.
- Name?
- The Heaven' s Mouth.
- Very beautiful.
Fine.
Lucero!
Don' t harass the lady!
Don' t worry, Mabel!
He' s teaching me how to swim.
- I' il help you.
- No, I can make it on my own, thanks.
Go to your friend, he' s all lonely.
The water is warm.
Go.
Let' s see how you play dead.
Oh, she' s dead.
Oh, Lucero.
Christian is a whiner.
He spends all night crying.
He only stops in my arms.
He likes to be with his little sister.
So pretty, isn' t she?
She looks a lot like you, Mabel.
Same eyes.
You should have sons, lady.
It shows you know how to handle them.
You' re the in the right age, right?
He fell asleep.
What do I do?
Marquez passes to Ramon.
Ramon places on Zepeda.
He stands out like a colossus of Santa Ursula.
Claudio the emperor steals the ball.
You can trust him!
A trustworthy emperor!
His majesty goes on, looks for a personal score.
Just shoot, heck!
Here we are.
A pass to Cuauhtemoc Which stops it.
He advances towards the goal...... and shoots!
The "human wall"!
Campos!
That' s why he' s a regular of the national team!
That' s why!
What?
Don' t you like Campos?
Wouldn' t you want to live forever?
- Yes.
- It' d be beautiful.
No?
By the end of the year, the family will move away...... because a new luxury hotel will rise in San Bernabe.
They' il move to the suburbs of Santa Maria Colotepec.
Chuy will create a transports company...... but will be hindered by the Acapulco syndicates...... and by the Consortium of Tourism.
Two years later, he' il be a cleaner in a hotel.
He won' t fish anymore.
- Heck?
- What?
What the hell?
- Speed up Chuy!
- Shit.
Get away from here, you bastards!
Not that way, no!
They' re shitting inside here, dude!
Get out, bastards!
- You' re throwing shit on me!
- Out!
Let' s go!
Quick, litile shit!
The pigs tore the camp to pieces.
It was evening already, and Julio and Tenoch decided to sleep in the city.
For 75 pesos, Chuy had found them a room with light and a toilet.
Luisa was tempted by the idea of a shower, although a cold one.
They would go tomorrow to pick up their stuff.
The 23 pigs had run away from a farm near there.
During the following 2 months, 14 were sacrificed.
3 will cause a gall- bladder infection...... after having being eaten at the "El Chavarin" ranch.
Don' t spin, asshole!
Tell your mother what you want.
Let me talk.
Let me talk or I' il hang up.
I would have left anyway, Jano...... your call makes everything easier.
This is not a revenge.
I' ve always known about your betrayals Carmen in Escorial...... and the one in Barcelona.
I' ve always known.
I just hoped you would change, that' s all.
My decision has nothing to do with that.
I can' t explain now, but soon you' il understand, okay?
Don' t blame yourself and don' t blame me...... it' s nobody' s fault.
No, I don' t hate you.
And please, don' t hate me.
Listen, Jano, listen.
I' m calling to say that I love you, and that you' ve been my life.
I don' t expect a happy farewell, but let it be affectionate, at least.
Calm down, please don' t act this way, please.
Did you notice I took less money than what was due?
No, I don' t need more.
I' m fine.
I let my keys in the kitchen.
Don' t lose the terrace key, there' s just one copy.
I took the T- shirts from Ibiza.
You know I like to sleep in them.
I just hope you learn to be happy.
I am now.
Take care, Jano.
I' il hang up now, okay?
Bye.
Fuck you!
Rematch!
I' m grateful to all the women Jano has betrayed me with.
How did I notice?
Fucking with him.
He experimented with me the things he learned from the others.
- You finally understand.
- Like the finger in the ass, right?
- Yes.
- Come on, really?
But you must know how to do it.
With delicacy.
You can' t just stick it in.
Jano was a master of finesse.
- To the master of finesse!
- To Jano!
Jano, wherever you are.
I' m glad I' ve met you.
Sometimes you' re fuckheads, but in the end...... you' re really smart.
You have the luck of living in a country like Mexico.
You can breath life everywhere here.
To the sweet Mexico!
- To Mexico!
Magic and musical.
- So, are you friends or not?
- No.
Come on, make peace.
- And so I' m a boor?
- Right that.
- Do you remember that big thing?
- Fuck, that' s my car.
And me, Mr. Delicacy?
- Okay, okay.
A hip guy.
- But you like coming to my place?
To see what your father steals.
But his father is a honest man, right?
Isn' t he honest?
What assholes!
Now you' re friends again.
- To the charrolastras!
- To the charolastras!
- Want beer?
- Yeah, pretty cold.
Sure, sure.
- Luisa.
- What?
- I' m sorry for the push.
- Oh, Julio...
-... you went beyond.
- I know.
- Give me a kiss.
- Forgive me.
You' re forgiven.
Hey, Luisa...... tell us the truth:
Who fucks better, between us?
The truth.
- You make me laugh.
- Come on.
Each one has certain qualities.
But who made you feel better?
I' il mimic Tenoch coming:
"Honey.
Honey! "
- I don' t believe it, pal.
- Julio crosses his eyes.
But you must stop jacking off and improve your resistance.
- He came sooner than me!
- Both do some training.
- And number Seven?
- Eliminate it.
Chuy, isn' t jacking off cool?
- To jacking off!
- Yeah!
You can' t toast to jacking off!
By the way:
You don' t know how to lick it.
- I didn' t do it at all.
- You' re surely as lame as Tenoch.
You licked it like that, like it were an icicle.
It must be done with care.
The clitoris must be a great friend of yours.
It' s a problem to find a great friend.
Search and you shall find.
There' s no greater pleasure than giving it.
- An applause for the clitoris!
- Yes!
- Up the clitoris.
- Up the clitoris.
Listen, seriously...
Truth, I want the truth:
Ceci sucked you off.
The truth?
- She nibbled it a bit, dude.
- Shit, she sucked you off!
- Ana bites, too?
- No, she sucks greatly!
- You said she didn' t suck you off.
- Only the tip.
She missed the big dish.
- Aren' t blow jobs great, Chuy?
- Heck, Chuy!
- Up the blow jobs!
- Wait.
Since we' re telling the truth:
I made Ceci many times.
No problem.
I screwed Ana many times, too.
- I' ve been there mixing up the cream.
- Me too!
Do you realize we' re foster- brothers?
He made my girl, but he comes in a blink!
To your girlfriends, who are making 10 Italians at a time!
- To Luigi!
- To Francesco!
I toast to Tiberio!
- Got any change?
- Who wants the little maggot here?
I' il take it.
Hey, Tenoch.
- And your mother, too, you know?
- What?
Really.
The day she washed my clothes.
Are you serious?
Absolutely!
- Cheers!
- You' re crazy.
Luisa!
To all mothers!
Who sings the "Fandunga"?
- "La Fandunga"?
- Are you joking?
Actually no.
Give me a number and a letter.
Thirteen.
- Ah...
B. - 13- B.
After Heaven' s mouth there' s Palikata and the beaches of Chacrita...... and Santa Rita.
- And Chacagua.
- "Chacagua." What wonderful names.
- What do they mean?
- I don' t know.
- Good morning, sleepyhead.
- Sleepyhead.
Want some eggs?
- A shrimp soup?
And a beer.
The best antidote.
- I gotta give the car back to my sister.
- Fine.
- Chacagua.
- Is there anything after Chacagua?
- There' s Amaranto.
Golden Beach is there.
Huge, with many waves.
Many people drown there.
But it' s wonderful.
- Some more soup.
- No, thanks.
I must go.
My parents must be worried.
And Julio must give the car back to his sister.
I was talking with Mabel about staying here some more...... to see some bays.
- I' m hungry, mom.
- Well, here you go.
Go, go!
That day Julio and Tenoch started their trip back home.
It was a silent trip with no events.
Their parents never knew they had gone to the sea with Luisa.
Luisa stayed exploring the bays around.
Parting from Tenoch and Julio, Luisa told them:
"Life is like the foam of the sea.
You must dive into it ".
On their return, Ana and Cecilia broke up with Tenoch and Julio.
Two months later, Tenoch began going out with a neighbor.
It took 11 months for Julio to go out with a French course mate.
Julio and Tenoch hung together less and less.
The next summer, the PRl...... lost the elections for the first time in 71 years.
Julio met Tenoch who was going to the dentist.
A coffee was less uncomfortable than the excuses not to do it.
- And Saba, have you ever met him again?
- I know he lives in Real de Catorce.
Really?
Fine.
And Daniel?
Self- declared queer.
His father kicked him out of home.
- A big trouble, isn' t it?
- On the contrary, he' s happy.
He' s even got a boyfriend and stuff.
It' s fine then.
- I' ve been admitted to the University.
- Great!
When will you start?
- In September.
- Economics?
Yep.
- And you?
- Biology at the UAM.
Next week.
- What a bad luck, huh?
The UAM begins sooner.
Do you know about Luisa?
No.
What?
- She' s dead.
- What the fuck are you saying?
- Anything else, guys?
- No, thanks.
- And how?
- Cancer.
She had it everywhere.
It happened there in San Bernabe.
A month after our departure.
Chuy called Jano, and that was all.
Terrible.
When we met her, she already knew she had to die.
She didn' t want to tell anyone.
Luisa spent her last 4 days in the Hospital of Santa Maria Colotepec.
By her request......
Chuy and Mabel never revealed her adventure with Tenoch and Julio.
Before dying, gave Lucero the stuffed mouse with her name as a present.
Tenoch apologized.
His girlfriend was waiting for him at the cinema.
Julio insisted to pay the bill.
They never met again.
- Hear you, huh?
- Yep.
The bill, please.
This subtitle has been brought to you by --- MOBUTU ---
Yes, I' m still on hold.
And, what is this?
I' m looking at your advertisement for the airline promotioning giveaway.
Ah, the promotion...
Yeah, it' s hard to understand because it' s says in addition to...... but I can' t exactly understand in addition to what...... because there' s actually nothing to add to.
I think that' s typo than.
Ok, so just to clarify, I' m sorry 10 purchases of any of your Healthy Choice products...... equals 500 miles, and with the coupon...... the same purchases would value 1000 miles?
Well, do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the price...... it is potentially worth more than the purchases?
I don' t know.
Could I call you back?
Could I ask your extension and your name possibly?
Its extension 215 and the name is Carter.
Carter.
Thank you very much Carter.
Bye- bye.
I' m not sure what that mean.
Is it break or something?
What is it?
Plastic?
It' s aaa... plastic, yeah.
But that kind of breaking shouldn' t be a problem.
All right.
Let me call you first thing tomorrow and I' m gonna run the numbers...... see what is it and then I call you back.
Ok... you have my home phone number, right?
What' s that for?
If you wanted to call me...
No, that' s fine.

Ok.
No, its fine.

Ok.
Ok, bye.
Hi!
Hi.

No.

They don' t get open until 8' a' clock.
Is it ok for me if I leave my car, you think?
I don’ t know... don' t know.
I thought they open at seven.
If I left my car, would it be Ok?
I don' t know...
Do you know them?
Not very well.
Can I ask you... can I trust to live my key with you, give it to you...... so when they get here you could give it to them?... ok... sure.
I think it' s OK where I left it, right there.
I can watch it.
Thanks a lot.... keep an eye on it.
There' s a piano on the street.
Yeah.
Ok, maybe I' il see you later, thank you for your help.
Thank you.
Maybe I' il see you later when I pick up my car.

May I please show you something?
Sure.

And I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
Yeah!
I don' t wanna do that!
I just...
I don' t do stuff like that!
No, you don' t really do anything!
She' d be looking at me!
So?
What' s wrong with looking at you?
It' s a free country!
It feels like I would be a little tense and I don' t think I' il act like myself.
Well... that' s kind of your fault!
It' s a slight chance I' m not even coming tonight!
Oh!
Really?
Everyone said you were coming!
Didn' t you tell everyone you were coming?
Yes, I renew my gym membership.
Oh, right!
Oh, god, well... that' s solve everything actually.

It' s not a big deal.
Well, you' il be fine!
Great!
Please don' t!
Just try to be your friend Barry.
Hope you can make it!
He' s not gonna come...
Hi!

We' re just talking about you.
Remember we used to call you gayboy, you get all mad.
What' s that?
We used to call you gayboy, remember...... you' d be fine and then we call you gayboy you just freak out!

You remember?
I don' t remember that!
Yes you do!
We' re calling you gayboy and you got so mad.
Are you gay now?
I don' t know.
I don' t know.
We were trying to figure out why did you have the hammer in the first place!

Yeah?
I don' t like myself sometimes.
Can you help me?
Barry, I' m a dentist, I...
What kind of help do you think I can give you?
I know.
I... maybe you know other doctors.
Like a psychiatrist?
I understand it' s confidential with the doctor...
And I just...
I don' t want my sisters to know, Ok?
I can trust you about this?
Barry, if it’ s about getting you a phone number for a psychiatrist I can do that.
It' s not a problem, but...... what exactly it' s wrong?
I don' t know if there is anything wrong because I don' t know how other people are.
I... sometimes cry a lot.
For no reason.

I' m sorry I couldn' t come to your sister' s birthday party last tonight.
Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn' t make it.
Not a problem!
Don' t worry about it!
We had a terrific time thou!
It must be a weight for you to have so many sisters.

Not at all!
It' s very nice.
Telephone, Barry, line 1!
This is Barry!
Hang up again and see the troubles it' s gonna make!
Thank you!
What do you mean, thank you?
This is good, you' re busy?
Yeah... not really.
I saw a picture of you.
Oh yes?
Elizabeth has a picture of you guys, your sisters and you.
It' s a lot of family, must be nice.
Do you have brothers and sisters?
No.
I' m the exact opposite.
That must be nice...
That must be really, really...
No, it' s terrible.
What' s the pudding for?
That' s something else!
Oh my god!
So, where you guys went on the breakfast?
How long have you been working with my sister?
Aaaa... 6 months, maybe 5.
So you know her.
Do you wanna check that?
Sure!
Are you OK?
They are ok.
So what do you do?
You do what she does?
The same job, the same work?
I do mainly field consultations, which is cool 'cause I got to travel.
I' m going to Hawaii on Friday.
Hawaii?
I was thinking about going there!
Really?
I was thinking about going there on business.
Well, if you gonna go...
I' m probably not gonna go thou...
Oh, that' s too bad 'cause it' s so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other.
Yes, that would be great, but I' m not exactly sure, I have so much going on here,... a lot depends on this thing, if it happens I won' t be able to go, but if doesn' t happen...
I can' t find the key to my car.
So?
Are you gonna come eat with us?
Yeah, I can' t.
Oh my god!
It was great to meet you again and thanks for helping me yesterday.
What is that piano?
What is this pudding?
I don' t know.
Why are they here?
Call me later and we can talk about asking Walter for the shrink...... and he said you have this crying problem or something?!
By Barry!
Call me later!
Barry seems very busy.
I don' t know if he has enough time for a girlfriend.
Sorry.
See you at the restaurant?
OK.
I' m gonna go and eat tommorrow night.
Do you want to go with me?
Sure!
Do you want to pick me up?
Sure!
Can I write down my address and phone number for you?
Sure.
This is funny.
Yeah.
There you go.
Thanks.
I didn' t ask for a shrink, that must have been somebody else.
Also that pudding isn' t mine.
Also I' m wearing a suit today because I had a very important meeting this morning and I don' t have a crying problem.
OK.
OK.
Hi.
Hi!
This is Barry.
You just made a fucking war for yourself that you can' t afford!
Uhh, yeah.
How do you know this guy is rich?
He said he was gonna diversify.
Diversify what?
His business.
And what is his name?
Barry Egan.
I can take the brothers on this mission?
Yes.
Thank you so much.
You can' t do that!
It' s wrong!
They' il go.
Great.
That' s all I' m paying to you guys.
That' s cool!
When can you leave?
As soon as you want to.
Well, I want you to go right away!
I think that' s best!
And I also really need you to check out a car for me down there.
All the expenses are on your own.
But Leticia said you' re gonna cover' em.
She didn' t know what she said.
Whatever man, that' s not cool.
David don' t just... seriously... right, doesn' t make any sense.
It' s business, seriously.
Look, 100 USD, 2 days work... it' s a lot more than your families are making sitting on their houses.
All right?
I' m serious now.
OK?
Keys to the truck.
And you got the gas set up.
All right, save receipts on that.
Here' s the address!
There was his business address too but...
You know... hit him at his house first.
Just fix it Sir!
You know, I wanna tell you something, I' ve got to tell you...
Oh no!
I saw a picture of you guys, your sisters and you and...
I saw your picture and I really wanted to meet you.
I came to drop my car off on purpose to try to meet you.
Boy... are you lying?
No.
I thought I should tell you...
I don' t want to hide something from you before we' re getting out.
Very nice of you to say.
Terrific!
I just love this guy because he tells it the way it is... he' s not a phony... and this guys... and this guy calls up and he' s talking about his senior quote... and so DJ Justice says:
"What was your senior quote?, What was so great about it?"
"Confusion say!"
And then DJ Justice says
"Confusion or Confucius?"
And it was just so comical.
You know, that' s my favorite part of the show and I laugh, I laugh and laugh...
How' s your business going?
Did you sell all that pudding?
The pudding is not a sales item...
Why?
Really?
Why is that?
I' d rather not say, if that' s OK.
Oh, I' m sorry, was it like a secret pudding?
Let' s just keep it between you and I, if that' s possible?
Sure, sure.
Healthy Choice and American Airlines got together for this promotion...
If you buy any 10 of Healthy Choice products they' il reward you 500 frequent flyer miles...... with a special coupon they' il up it to a 1000 miles.
So I think they' re trying to push their Teriyaki Chicken which is 1. 79 USD...
But I went to the Supermarket, I looked arround and I saw that they had pudding at 0. 25 USD/ cup.
Comes in packages of four, but insanely...... the barcodes are on the individual cups!
So, a quarter of a cup... say you bought 2. 50 USD worth...
That' s worth 500 miles,... with the coupon it' s a 1000 miles...
It' s a marketing mistake but I' m taking advantage of it.
If you already spent 3000 USD... that will get you a million frequent flyer miles...... you would never have to pay for a ticket for the rest of your life!
So you put a lot pudding so you can get free coupons.
Yes.
That' s insane!
I' m guessing it was a mistake... but I' m taking advantage of the wallets offered.
Who knows how long it will last!
Too many peoples start doing it!
Your sister has told me a history about you.
When you were kids you throw a hammer through the door, right?
Threw a hammer!
I don' t remember doing that.
My sister' s a liar!
I have to go to the bathroom.
Hello!
Can I talk to you sir?
Why?
I... just need you for a second, please.
Sir, the bathroom has just torn apart.
Yeah.
Did you do it?
No.
You didn' t just smashed up the bathroom?
Well, who did?
I don' t know.
Sir, your hand is bleeding.
I cut myself.
On my knife.
What?
Sir, your hand is bleeding.
I know.
I' m gonna have to ask you to leave.
Yeah, but I didn' t do anything.
Sir, I' ve got no way to prove that you smashed up the bathroom.
I didn' t do that.
Look, I' m gonna have to ask you to go.
I didn' t do that.
I' m gonna have to ask you to leave.
Please don' t do this to me!
Sir, I' m gonna call the police!
All right.
Can I just...
Sir, I' m gonna crack your fuckin 'head open!
Get out of here!
We should go right now.
Ok.
Thank you.
So, you know that... the harmonium that you send it up in your office...
Harmonium...
Piano.
Did you steal that from the street?
What' s this?
You did, didn' t you?
Yeah, I did, why, is it yours?
No, it' s yours.
You' re going to play it?
I wouldn' t put on any concerts yet!
So, I' m sorry, I don' t mean to............ about the pudding and the harmonium and everything... but....

I' il realize that this may seem a little strange but it' s not.
So would you like to come with me?
Ok.
Right now?
Yes!
First I saw the Teriyaki Chicken for 1. 79 USD and then the soup, which made a real deal,... but the stumble across the pudding it' s just tremendous.
How most people don' t look, they don' t look at the fine print Lance!
Oh!

You can go to places in the world, but pudding... that is funny!
Yeah!

It' s gonna work!
I' m coming, I' m coming, I' m coming...
Baby I' m coming!
Better go on line...
OK!
I' m coming!
No no no no...
What do you mean?
That it takes six to eight weeks?
Sir...
Sir, it takes that much time to process the order to make sure that it is valuable.
I had this plan in my mind, OK?
I, I was gonna get the pudding today.
I can get the pudding over to you today, that' s it, I' m leaving today.
Sir, as I explained to you before, it takes this much time to process.
But how am I supposed to know this if you don' t tell me this, it' s not in your rules and regulations,..... in the fine print.
That' s an impossibillity.
- It takes that much time to process.
Ok, I didn' t see a 6 or an 8 anywhere.
This is bull... crap to me.
No, no no no...
Sir, it takes that much time to process.
Hello?
Hello?
All right!
The pudding is gonna take 6 to 8 weeks to process, so that' s not gonna work today.
I take a bath on that today!
But here' s what I' m gonna tell you.
Pudding!

Oh my God, I know exactly what are you saying!
You fuck, she' il think you' re a pervert!
Don' t do this to me.
What do you want her number for?
All I want is her number, can you help me out?
Tell me why...
There' s no reason for you to treat me this way!
You' re killing me!
You' re killing me with the way you torture me.
All I want is the fucking number!
That should be goddamn good enough for you.

I realize you have my home phone number......
I' m away on vacation right now, if you guys wanna reach me...... shortly I will be home and we can discuss how you can return my money.
Otherwise, I' m pretty sure that the Police can be contacted and I could do that...... and I feel like it' s warranted, so let' s figure something out!
Ok, thank you.
How many airplanes have you been on?
I think... maybe over a hundred.
That' s right.

So you tell me "that' s that" before I beat the hell from you.
I have so much strength in me you have no idea.
I have a love in my life, it makes me stronger than anything you can imagine.
I would say "that' s that" mattress man.
Did you come all this way just to tell me this?
Yes I did.

Where are you going?
Hi Lena.
I' m so sorry.
I' m so sorry I left you at the hospital.
I called a phone sex line...
I called a phone sex line before I met you.
And four blond brothers came after me.
And they hurt you and I' m sorry.
And then I had to live again because I wanted to make sure you never got hurt again.
And... and I have a lot of pudding...... and 6 to 8 weeks it can be redeemed.
I think I can get enough mileage to go with you wherever you have to go, if you have to travel...... for your work because I don' t ever want to be anywhere without you.
So... could you just let me redeem the mileage?
You left me in the hospital.
I' m sorry.
You can' t do that.
Ok.
If you just give me 6 to 8 weeks, I can redeem the mileage,...... and I can go with you wherever you have to travel.
So here we go!

Put the juice back where it belongs.
Come back!
You didn' t get any Ietters today.
I think your mother' s forgotten you.
No, I want to sit here...
It just takes a few minutes.
Okay if they' re young guys, but if they' re disgusting old men...
On the other hand it' s much quicker.
One, two and it' s over!
Then you get the money and can buy a dress or something.
No, never.
It' s horrible!
Let' s go!
- How was it?
- Okay.
I' m freezing!
TeII me how it was.
Forget it.
Let' s get home, it' s so cold!

- Let' s go over there and I' II explain.
So. What' s happening?
Like... my dad found the money...
And I thought it didn' t make any difference to you.
What doesn' t make any difference to me?
You don' t have any parents.
I mean, your mom' s in the States.
What doesn' t make any difference to me?
I told dad that it was your money.
- That you did what I did.
- You said that I did it?
Yeah, you know.
If my dad had known, he would have kiIled me!

My mom also worked here.

And your dad?
He was in the army and came here for a Iittle while...
He probably just wanted to sleep with my mom.
Then she got pregnant and he moved to Moscow.
She wrote to him, but he didn' t answer.
I' ve never seen him.
Come on, I' m freezing.
"Speech given by the GeneraI Secretary, Comrade Brezhnev..."

"Prolonged and thundering applause.
Everyone stands up. "
I Iive here.
Look, this is my room.

What do you think happens when someone dies?
Does he go to paradise, to God and Jesus and aII of that?

I believe that.
I think you become an angeI in heaven.
You can play basketbaII aII day Iong and score as many points as you Iike.
And be a miIlion times better than MichaeI Jordan.
That' s buIlshit...
That' s not the only thing you can do there.
You can do what you Iike in paradise.
Dance, play computer games, go to parties...
That' s stupid.
I' m not going to die, I' m going to America.
I' d play basketbaIl.

Stop it...
I don' t want to be here anymore.
I' m tired of this...
SUMMONS TO SOClAL WELFARE
So you' ve had no contact with your mother since she moved to America?
- No.
- And she hasn' t caIled?
I don' t have a telephone.
- She hasn' t written?
- No.
We' ve received a Ietter from her.
Do you know anything about this?
No. Why?
In the Ietter she writes...
Of course it' s not IegaIly binding.
You can' t formaIly do this...
But she writes that she renounces her parenthood.
This means that she no Ionger wishes to be your guardian.
Guardian?
What are you talking about?
Look, I reaIly feeI sorry for you, but here she writes...
I can read it to you.
"Lilya has always been an unwanted child" -
- "and therefore I no Ionger wish to be her guardian."
"I here by hand her over to the care of the SociaI Services."
It' s awful, I understand...

HeIl, you scared me!

Sorry, I scared you.

I' m only here on holiday.
I Ieave in a week.
You can come with me.
I can get a job and a flat for you there.
It' d be cool...
Haven' t you ever thought of Ieaving here?
This country is shit.
There' s nothing to do here.
Sweden is a paradise compared to here. You can reaIly relax there.
And the people...
Even the people are different.
They' re kind, not Iike here.
Besides, you can earn reaIly good money.
You know, in one month you can earn what a doctor makes here in a year.
- That can' t be true!
- Yes it is, reaIly!
Look at it here...
People are crazy!
You know what my cousin did?
He sold one of his kidneys because he didn' t have money.
Would you seII a kidney?
You don' t deserve a Iife Iike that.
- What happened to the baIl?
- Dad broke it.
- Broke it?
- Just punctured it.
- Why?
- With scissors.
- Why?
- I don' t know.
He went crazy.
I' II fix it...
Open up!
It' s the police!
Is it reaIly the police?
Open or we' il break the door down!
- Hi there!
How are things?
- What do you want?
- Come here!
- What do you want?
- Get out!

I don' t give a shit about them.
They' re assholes.
I' m getting out of here soon anyway.
You want some glue?

I' m going to get you a job in Sweden.
ReaIly, I swear.
I don' t want to Ieave you here alone.
I' II talk to Andrei.
I' m so glad you' re coming to Sweden.
We' II get a reaIly big flat... with an enormous bathroom...
Everything you want.
There' s something I want to ask you.
I have a friend and I wanted to ask you whether...
Later, Iater...
We' II talk about it Iater.
Later, Iater...
- You' re stupid.
- I' m stupid?
- You' re stupid.
- I' m stupid?
- Yes, you are!
- You can Ieave if I' m stupid.
- And why am I stupid?
- 'Cause that guy' s tricking you.
- Tricking me?
- Yes, he reaIly is...
- No way!
- Course he is.
In what way?
He talks about jobs in Sweden, but he just wants to sleep with you.
- In reality, there' II be no job.
- Course there wiII be!
I promise I' II get you a job in Sweden.
I' II talk to Andrei.
Haven' t you talked to him yet?
- I forgot.
- You said you' d talk to him.
Sorry, I forgot!
I' II talk to him, I promise.
- Were you doing something else?
- Stop it, I' II talk to him.
- What job is it?
- Something with vegetables.
- Vegetables?
- Picking them or something...
Picking?
In winter?
Vegetables don' t growin winter.
So?
Maybe it' s warmer in Sweden.
- You know where Sweden is?
- Roughly.
- Where?
- I don' t know exactly...... but somewhere in the EU... or whatever it' s caIled.
And you, what do you know?.!
- You' re just jealous.
Jealous?
No.

- No, I' m not!
- Course you are.
- No...
- Yes.
- No.
Course I' m not.
- Is it for me?
- Yes, who else?
- What is it?
- Open it, you' II see.
A passport?
- Look at the Iast page.
- What' s there?
Now your name is Katya.
- Why?
- There could be problems at the border.
You' re not 18 yet.
It' s so they won' t ask unneccessary questions.
By the way, I rang my boss.
He said you could start on Monday.
This Monday?
- Yes, this Monday.
We go on Sunday.
I have... to ask you something.
Could you get a job for another person?
I don' tk now.
It' s for my friend, a friend that means a Iot to me.
I don' t want him to be here alone.

It' s not entirely out of the question.
You' re too good!

I' m sorry, but it' s my grandmother.
It might be the Iast time I see her.

And this world isn' t that good.
Now I' m jumping... and flying...
No, you can' t...
Why not?
It' s up to me.
I' ve had it with this Iife.

This Iife is the only one you' ve got.

You wanted to finish writing first.
Do you remember?

Everyone' s spitting at you, but you' re not ready.
Jump if you want.
It' s not dangerous.

Bye!
You dropped your potatoes.
Let me help you.
This film is dedicated to the miIlions of children around the world exploited by the sex trade.
What' s the core temperature?
Seven hundred and twenty- five degrees.
Entering airlock.
Easy.
How is it in there?
Doctor.
Doctor.
Take them to bow torpedo.
Keep them as far away from the radiation as possible.
- How do you feel?
- It' s all right.
Good.
Give me his dosimeter.
Thankyou.
His radiation level is low, Doctor.
Yes?
Yes, of course.
Report to me on their condition, in an hour.
Good news, Anatoly.
You got a mild dose.
- All right.
- Gently.
It' s time.
Comrades, it' s time.
Put your mask on.
Hey, come on.
Let' s go.
Ten minutes.
Look at me.
Come on!
Wake up!
It' s time to go.
Go, go.
It' s all right.
Chief.
Come on.
I have him.
Chief Gorelov' s gone in his place.
Good boy.
Captain.
You sent for me?
Yes.
We won' t be firing any missiles.
So, do you know how to take radiation readings?
- Yes, Comrade Captain.
- I want readings from all compartments.
Yes, Captain.
- Temperature?
- Nine hundred twenty- five degrees.
How long?
Seven minutes, forty seconds.
Set him down.
Chief!
Chief!
Yes.
Konstantin is getting him.
He' s getting him.
You did good.
You did good.
He' s getting him.
We' il get him.
Yes, yes, yes.
It' s flowing.
It' s flowing.
The coolant is flowing.
Tell the captain the coolant' s flowing.
Oh, you did it.
Chief!
You did it, my boy.
You did it, my boy.
You did it.
Yeah, you showed them.
You showed them.
You showed them.
Easy.
- Give him a hand here.
Gently.
Okay.
Come on.
I have you, mate.
Nine hundred and fifty.
Nine hundred and thirty.
It' s dropping.
Nine hundred and twenty.
Nine hundred and ten.
Nine hundred.
- Captain.
- Chief.
Eight fifty.
Eight hundred and thirty.
Eight hundred.
This is the captain.
The reactor appears to be under control.
Ourthanks to ChiefEngineer Gorelov... and the third watch reactor unit... for a job well done.
Rest, boy.
- Ship' s heading?
- 2- 2- 0, Captain.
Turn the boat around.
Come to a heading of 0- 4- 0.
Forward motor, slow ahead.
Starboard, 30.
- Course, 0- 4- 0.
- Forward motor, slow ahead.
Starboard, 30.
Standard course, 0- 4- 0.
Back to base?
With a speed of five knots, it' il take days.
We shall be a ghost ship.
Captain.
- The men are hungry.
- The food is contaminated.
Give them whateveryou have in tins or in foil.
And give them red wine to slow the rate of radiation absorption.
Very well, Captain.
Captain, in here, it' s only five units.
But in the reactor room, it' s ten times that.
Turn off the ventilation system.
All compartments, shut down main ventilation.
Captain, ifwe --
We' il run the boat with skeleton crews.
Put the men on top... as far away from the radiation as possible.
We' re 1 60 kilometers from the NATO base in Jan Mayan.
We could go there, get help from the Americans.
Under no circumstances... will I abandon my boat or my crew to the enemy.
What is your plan?
We' re out of radio contact.
Ifwe stay on our course... fleet command will send the diesels to find us.
Radiation levels are rising too fast.
We' re just running on electric motors.
There' s no time for that.
They will find us.
As usual, the captain leaves no room for doubt.
Good.
You' re fine.
Good.
You' re fine, Yevgeny.
Next.
Good.
Yes.
Next.
Icons... are forbidden.
Contact bearing 0- 1 - 5.
Range 2, 000 meters, Captain.
Wait, wait.
Wait, wait!
Wait, wait!
They' re Americans.
Captain.
The jackals have found us.
It' s an American destroyer.
Captain.
The Americans are contacting us on the emergency band.
The helicopter' s reported our men on deck.
The captain is offering assistance.
Tell them we don' t require assistance.
We' re just getting some air.
- What are they doing?
- Taking pictures of us.
Hey!
Hey, spies!
Take a look at this!
- Hey, you take a look at this!
- Everybody!
Look at this lovely, lovely boat.
- Hey!
- Hey!
Offering assistance.
They want this boat.
What a victory that would be.
The waters here are over a mile deep.
We could get the men off, scuttle the boat.
- They' d have to take us.
- Captain Polenin is right.
We have the life rafts.
We can save everyone.
Scuttle the flagship of the fleet?
Present my crew to the Americans for interrogation?
Your duty now is clear, Captain.
You must save their lives.
My duty is to defend the state... and I will do that to my last dying breath.
You' re defending nothing but your own ambition.
Tell that to the men who are dying down there.
Tell them.
There will be no more talk of surrendering to the Americans.
It is treason.
You mention it one more time...
I will have you confined to your quarters.
And you, you are the commissar... representative of the party, responsible for crew morale.
- Yes, Captain.
- Then act like it.
The crew need you to show courage, not fear.
- Fear is contagious.
- Yes, Captain.
- Yes, Captain?
- Stop monitoring the Americans.
- They are the enemy.
- Yes, Captain.
Help me.
Please.
- How are the men?
- How would I know?
I don' t know the first thing about radiation sickness.
Please.
I' m giving them aspirin.
And I' m trying to prevent those that are dying... from irradiating those of us that still have some hope.
Pull yourself together.
You are an officer in the Soviet Navy.
Go back and tell them that they' re improving.
As you say, you know nothing about radiation sickness.
Perhaps they are.
- Captain.
- Yes?
Readings are rising in every compartment now.
- Comrade Suslov.
- What is it?
The radiation is going to kill us all.
The political branch gives you the authority... to approve any change of command.
Only in extreme cases of dereliction of duty.
Which this is.
He' s suffering from radiation poisoning himself.
His judgment' s impaired, or he would get the men off the boat.
When the moment comes, we will know it.
The weld is giving way!
The core temperature is 450 degrees and rising.
Captain.
- The reactor repair has failed.
- Captain.
Core temperature is 450 degrees and rising.
This is the captain.
All hands below decks.
Prepare for emergency descent.
All hands below!
All hands below!
Diving stations!
Diving stations!
Get the bulkhead door shut!
I am not going back down!
I am not going down!
All hands to diving stations!
Move!
Come on!
We have to go now!
Andrei, no!
No, Andrei!
What are you doing!
Diving now!
Diving now!
Go!
Get in!
Get in the hatch!
That' s an order!
- Move it!
- We can' t just leave him here!
Are the Americans still offering assistance?
- The captain said not to -- - Check.
- They' re still there.
- Why is he diving?
He' il cook us.
- No!
I won' t go!
- Hey!
- Yevgeny!
We' re diving!
- No!
Prepare the tank!
Quickly!
Give it to me!
This is bullshit!
Put me down!
Fire in aft torpedo!
Let' s go!
- Come on.
Report!
Fire in aft torpedo.
We have no communication.
- Our fire team is suiting up.
- Activate the fire system.
- That will kill everybody in there.
- The torpedos will kill everyone.
- They have breathing kits.
- They don' t.
We took their oxygen for the reactor team.
- Give the fire team some time.
- Activate the system.
The primary was never connected.
It has to be activated locally.
Go to nine and turn on the system.
You refuse my order?
I' il do it myself.
You leave the command center, I will get help from the Americans... and you will be in no position to stop me.
Ifwe can' t handle it, I' il switch on the system myself.
Get the fire out.
And quickly!
Why aren' t we diving?
Under the authority given to me by the party... you are hereby removed from your post for dereliction of duty.
Isolate electrical!
You' re wasting time.
Get a team to repair the reactor.
Torpedo number eight!
Kornilov, tell the Americans we are evacuating the submarine... and will require assistance.
Send the message.
US destroyer.
US destroyer.
This is Soviet submarine.
Over.
Comrade Admiral.
General Vershinin, KGB.
I want to know ifyour man Vostrikov is a traitor.
All we know is that K- 1 9 has broken off radio contact.
Broken radio contact with us.
A reconnaissance plane has spotted a destroyer... shadowing K- 1 9.
An American destroyer.

- Shut up!
You have no idea what you' re doing.
Easy, easy.
- Who is it?
- It' s Dmitri.
Captain Polenin to central command.
- Repeat.
Captain Polenin!
- Do what you can, Vanya.
- It' s all right.
- Central command.
Immediately!
Five men.
Captain Polenin, I have exercised my authority... to transfer the boat to your command.
You' re our captain and always have been.
We' ve contacted the Americans.
All that is needed is your order to abandon ship.
Good.
Good.
Weapons don' t belong here.
Give them to me.
Give me the gun.
Come on.
Give it to me.
This boat' s a family.
- Of course, Captain.
- And the key for the handcuffs.
Captain.
You betray your family.
You betray me.
- You' re under arrest.
- What?
The both ofyou!
Get out of my sight!
Take their guns.
Lock them in their quarters.
Move.
Captain Polenin, it' s treason!
The fire in compartment ten has been extinguished.
The suppression system was not required.
Unfortunately, there was only one survivor.
Thankyou.
- Captain.
- Captain.
We have to dive.
This is the captain.
Don' t order them, Captain.
Ask them.
This is the captain.
Our situation is desperate.
The reactor repair has failed.
At any moment, we could have an explosion... which could set off the warheads.
This would destroy the American ship... only a few kilometers... from the NATO base.
Given the current level oftensions... between our countries... this could result in horrifying retaliatory attacks... on the motherland.
We could dive... and attempt to repair the reactor.
There are no guarantees.
I am standing by.
Secure both bulkhead doors.
Compartment ten isolated.
Compartment nine clear ofsmoke... manned and ready.
Compartment eight serving the Soviet Union, Comrade Captain.
Compartment seven standing by to do our duty, Comrade Captain.
Compartment five manned and ready..
Compartment four.
We await your orders, Captain.
Compartment one.
We are with you, Comrade Captain.
Ready to dive, Captain.
- Dive the boat.
- Dive the boat.
Make her depth 300 meters.
Keep five degrees.
- Flood all main ballast.
- Flood all main ballast.
- Electric motors full ahead together.

Keep five degrees, bow down.
Radtchenko.
Lieutenant Radtchenko.
Lieutenant Radtchenko, report.
Captain, reactor temperature' s 760 degrees and rising.
Lieutenant Radtchenko.
- Where is he?
- He' s inside.
How long has he been in there?
- Eighteen minutes.
- Eighteen minutes?
Wait.
Captain.
- You can' t go in without your -- - Secure the hatch.
I can' t see.
I can' t see.
- Let me help you.
- Captain.
- I have you.
- I' m sorry.
Open the hatch!
- 280 meters.
- Level off.
Coming through.
970 degrees and holding, Captain.
Open the bulkhead door.
He got a terrible dose.
Who' s going in next?
Captain, the temperature' s falling.
He did it.
He turned himself into a hero.
Surface the boat.
- Blow the main ballast.
- Keep rising the planes.
- Keep 1 5 degrees by the bow.
- Motors at full ahead together.
- You have the conn.
- Full rise, 1 5 degrees by the bow.
I have the conn.
Signal the American captain as soon as we surface.
Tell him we require his assistance.
Yes, Captain.
Yes, Captain.
- Up periscope.
- Periscope going up.
Men... you have done your duty for the motherland.
The party is proud ofyou.
I am -- I am proud ofyou.
I am -- I am proud ofyou.
Captain.
Captain.
Yes, Vadim.
I' m here.
The weld, is it holding?
Yes, Vadim, the weld is holding.
You' re a hero, Vadim.
Do you hear?
You are a hero.
You are all... all of you... heroes.
I had hoped one of our own boats would find us.
The radiation levels are rising too quickly.
I have asked the American captain...
for his help.
Prepare to abandon the boat.
Range, 2, 000 meters.
Captain, I have a contact!
- What the -- - Captain!
- The boat could be in trouble.
- What sort of trouble?
I' ve known Captain Vostrikov personally for half his life.
There isn' t a submariner in the navy whose loyalty I trust more.
More than his father' s loyalty?
I never knew his father.
Captain.
Captain.
When my father went to sea... he used to carry these... great handfuls of dirt in his pockets.
"A bit of the motherland," he said.
He would rather die than betray his country.
Contact me from the bridge when the last lifeboat is loaded.
I' il sink the boat.
The Americans won' t get her.
That won' t be necessary, Captain.
Our submarine, S270, has found us.
Yes.
Yes.
Confirm and out.
Reply from Moscow, Captain, sent through S270.
Your request to remove the men from the boat... is denied, Comrade Captain.
They' re sending a freighter to tow us back to base.
Anything else?
They said --
They said to give the men plenty of fresh fruit.
I want my men off this boat.
I am countermanding Moscow.
You know that it will be the end of your career.
They' il send you to the gulag, like your father.
Well, it' s a family tradition, isn' t it?
Let' s go!
Let' s go!
- Come on!
- We' ve got you.
Easy.
Good.
Good man.
Good.
You must be decontaminated.
Do you understand?
We must make you clean.
Scrub him.
It' s cold.
You' il be warmer inside.
You must take your clothes off.
We will decontaminate you and destroy the clothes.
- Then you can go down below.
- Take off your pants.
Easy.
- Back this way.
- Watch the rope.
- Pass it over.
- Come on, pull it.
Be careful there.
This is your boat, Misha.
I lost my position, Yuri, but not my self- respect.
You lost both.
- Where am I going?
- Bring a blanket here.
They' re taking you across, Vadim.
I need my picture of Kataya.
- Where is it?
- In my pocket.
Here you are.
There it is.
I can' t see.
I can' t see her.
All men accounted for, Captain.
Come on, come on.
Give them here.
Why didn' t you take command when you had the chance?
Because what they did was wrong.
Prepare the tow, Captain.
Captain.
- Move all these men out.
- Move back.
Lev, you' re a welcome sight.
Moscow thought you were defecting with your boat.
They want me to make a list of the men who are fit enough to testify.
Testify?
About what?
About you.
Make sure all the lines are secure.
You' re going home.
- Thankyou, Doctor.
We did it.
We' re going home.
Let' s keep moving.
Keep moving.
- Yes, come on now.
- Let' s go home.
At every stage ofthis disaster, which came within moments... of being a far greater disaster... the officers and crew did what had to be done.
Seven are now dead... and nobody knows how many more are dying... or how fast.
These are the men who returned home to be interrogated... as if a crime had been committed... questioned even when undergoing treatment for radiation poisoning...
Iocked up and denied access to wives and families.
But they and their comrades saved K - 19.
And maybe... just maybe, they saved all of you as well.
Thank you, Captain Polenin.
- One thing more, please.
- Thank you.
No captain in the Soviet Navy has ever been faced with such decisions -- the fate of the boat, the crew... the fate of the world... all in the balance.
The navy is my life.
And one thing I know, there can be only one captain of a ship.
The burden of command is on his shoulders... and his alone.
None of you --
None of you has the right to judge Captain Vostrikov.
You weren' t there.
I was.
He was our captain.
He was my captain.
And it would be an honor... to sail under his command again.
East Germany has agreed to do... what the West has been demanding it should do for more than a generation.
After opening up the Berlin Wall, the government has now announced... it will hold democratic elections. it will hold democratic elections.
You' re not so tall as I remember.
It' s good to see you.
And you.
Please.
I' m glad you found me... but today was, in fact, not very convenient.
No, no.
It had to be today.
Your crew.
It was 28 years ago today.
Captain, a toast.
To the men still on patrol.
For their courage, I nominated these men... for the title Hero of the Soviet Union.
But the committee ruled... that because it was not wartime...
because it was merely an accident... they were not worthy of the title Hero.
What good are honors from such people?
These men sacrificed... not for a medal... but because, when the time came... it was their duty... not to the navy... or to the state...
but to us... their comrades.
And so... to comrades.
To comrades!
I hate television.
Gives me headaches.... makes your color- treated hair...
You know, I heard there' s so many magnetic waves traveling through the air because of TV and telephones, that we' re losing, like ten times as many brain cells as we' re supposed to.
Like, all the molecules in our heads are all unstable.
All the companies know about it but they' re not doing anything about it.
It' s, like, a big conspiracy.
Say hello to luscious, full bod...
You have any idea how many electro- rays are traveling through our head every second?
I got a better one.
Have you heard about this videotape that kills you when you watch it?
What kind of tape?
A tape, a regular tape.
You start to play it and it' s, like, somebody' s nightmare.
Then suddenly, this woman comes on smiling at you, right?
Seeing you through the screen... and as soon as it' s over... your phone rings.
Someone knows you' ve watched it and what they say is...
"You will die in seven days" and exactly seven days later...
Who told you that?
Somebody from Revere.
Who told you?
What' s your problem?
I' ve watched it.
It' s a story, Katie.
I thought you were with your parents.
I wanted to tell you.
Some of his friends got this- this place up in the mountains.
They were trying to record a football game.
I guess the reception was so bad...
What are you talking about?
Listen to me!
When we played the tape, the game wasn' t there.
It was...
What?
Wh- What was it?
It was something else.
We thought it was some kind of sick joke... and then the phone rang.
It was a week ago... one week ago tonight.
You' re just trying to scare me.
Oh, my God, Katie!
Are you okay?
You freak!
You totally fell for it!
No.
So... did you guys, you know, do anything?
Like what?
Oh, my God, you totally did!
You ho!
There really is a tape?
Wait, don' t!
Embrey residence.
Hi, Mom.
She' s glad you' re here.
Yeah, we' re about to go to sleep.
Okay.
Yeah, I will.
Okay!
Okay, yeah, yeah, I will.
No, I won' t.
Bye, Mom.
Becca, quit being a bitch.
Where' s the remote?
Becca, quit it!
Becca, can you hear me?
I am being objective!
Listen, Harvey, you punctilious prick you touch my column and I' m coming down there and poking your eye out with that little red pencil you like so much!
Harvey?
Shit!
Hey...
Sorry I' m late.
No worries.
I' il wait in the car.
Have you got a moment, Ms. Keller?
Um, sure.
Call me Rachel.
Please, sit down.
He certainly is very independent, isn' t he?
Oh, yeah, he sure is.
I never have to tell him to do anything.
Well, if that' s a problem you' d be the first teacher in history to say so.
Ms. Keller...
Rachel.
I know that Aidan recently lost his cousin...
Yes, and I' m doing what I can to find him some good daycare.
Oh, no, that' s not what I meant.
By all means, take your time.
I know they were very close, Aidan and his cousin.
They spent a few nights a week together.
Did he talk to you about her death?
Well, like you said, he' s not the talkative type.
That doesn' t mean he has nothing to say.
He knows I' m there.
Yes, I' m sure he does but he may be expressing himself in... other ways.
I' d like to show you something.
That' s his cousin.
That' s Katie.
Ms. Keller...
I' m bothered by these drawings.
Listen, I appreciate your concern but my son lost his best friend three nights ago.
He' s just trying to deal with it.
Yes, I understand, but these pictures...
Are Aidan' s way of working it out... of expressing himself, like you said.
He' il be okay.
You say she died three nights ago?
Yeah, that' s right.
Aidan drew these last week.
What?
Nothing.
Shall we read something?
I' m kind of tired.
Okay.
Sweet dreams.
We don' t have enough time.
Oh, honey, I know I' ve been working a lot and I' m sorry but I promise you, I' m going to make it up to you.
I' m not talking about that.
I' m talking about time before we die.
You have lots of time.
So, you know when I' m going to die?
No.
No one does but I know you don' t have to worry about it.
Katie knew.
She told me.
Katie told you she was going to die?
She said she didn' t have enough time.
Good night, Rachel.
Oh, shit!
Aidan...
Goddamn it!
Have you seen my black dress?
Aidan?
Have you seen my black... dress?
It' s a little wrinkled.
It' s fine.
Kids don' t have strokes... unless they' re on drugs.
So, then, why the closed coffin?
Oh, Ruthie.
I' m so sorry.
You all right, Dave?
Yeah, I' m fine.
How are you?
He sleeps all day.
He doesn' t move.
It' s too much for him.
It doesn' t make any sense, Rachel.
I spent four hours on the Internet and I couldn' t find one single case of a 16- year- old girl' s heart just stopping.
I spoke to three different doctors and not one of them could tell me exactly what happened to my daughter.
She was close... with you.
And Aidan.
But she confided in you.
Yeah, but she never said anything... nothing that would explain what happened.
But you could find out.
It' s what you do, isn' t it -- ask questions?
Rachel, please.
I saw her face.
I knew Becca.
I mean, she was a little intense, but she wasn' t crazy.
They don' t put you in booties and a straightjacket if you' re just freaked out.
Something scared the shit out of her.
Hi.
So, who' s in the mental hospital?
Becca...
Katie' s friend.
Oh, right.
There when it happened.
So, what do you think they were doing up there?
Oh, thanks.
Me and my girlfriend used to sneak up to my room, get high.
Do you think maybe she was into...?
It' s not about that.
It' s about the tape.
Kellen, don' t even.
What tape?
The one that kills you when you watch it.
Oh, please.
What was on the tape?
I haven' t seen it, obviously.
But Katie told you she saw this tape?
I heard it from her boyf...
You heard it from who?
She was dating this guy Josh.
He goes to Revere.
It was kind of a secret.
Kind of?
Where is he -- Josh?
Josh is dead.
What?
What happened?
Supposedly, he killed himself... the same night that Katie died.
Aidan... what are you doing in here?
Come on.
We shouldn' t be in her room.
It' s not her room anymore.
10: 00 p. m.
Time of death, Wade that' s all I want to know.
The name' s Katie Embrey.
Pull the report and read the time.
I' il hold.
"Punctilious prick"?
Nice alliteration, huh?
You' re fired.
Yes, you are.
No, I' m not.
What is it?
Yeah, I' m still here.
Shh!
Okay, so what' s the time of death?
I was wondering...
Pick a card, any card.
Go ahead.
Okay, put it back.
Don' t let me see it.
That your card?
No.
Damn.
I was wondering if you' d remember someone from a week ago.
It' s my niece.
She sort of ran out on her parents.
I have some photos here.
That' s her and her friends.
Yeah, they were in Cabin 12.
They didn' t pay.
Had a number of complaints, about the TV, mainly.
Uh, reception' s never good here.
That' s why we bought tape players for videos.
Quite a selection.
left by other guests.
Anyway, they didn' t pay.
And kids like that sometimes don' t.
Miss?
You know, I' m kind of tired.
I' m thinking I might take a nap before I drive back.
I' il take Cabin 12.
Hey.
This is your card, right?
That' s it.
Seven days.
I' m going to school.
What do you think?
Well, it' s a pretty cool effect.
What does this have to do with the tape?
Take my picture.
Are you going to look at me at least?
This the same camera?
Scan the rest.
So, what do you think?
Well, look, I thought you said this was about a tape.
I' m thinking maybe you shouldn' t see it.
No, I should know more about it first.
Well, isn' t that why I' m here?
So you can benefit from my wisdom?
Four kids are dead, Noah.
Not from watching a videotape.
Come on, show it to me.
Roll credits.
That was very student film.
I' m sure it' s a lot... scarier at night.
You going to get that?
So, you been working a lot?
I' m not tired, Noah.
Okay.
That tape didn' t scare you?
No, not really.
Four people are dead.
Yeah, but like I said, not from watching...
Four people who watched it.
Come on, we watched it.
We' re hanging.
Right.
Yeah, I' m just going to go downtown.
I got to pick up some cameras from this guy and then I got to prep this thing that I may end up doing next week.
-- Hmm?
Would you say that I' m gullible?
No.
Easily rattled?
Definitely not.
I mean, you' re a little highly strung maybe.
And you ain' t much of a dresser.
Who made it?
Where' d it come from?
All right.
I' il see what I can do.
Yeah.
You sure this is a copy?
Yeah, why?
The numbers are all screwed up.
The same problem got copied, I guess.
That' s impossible.
The numbers of the control track they put on the tape whenever it' s recorded which means theoretically, there shouldn' t be any images.
Hey, Noah, can you pretend for one minute that I don' t read Video Geek Magazine?
Okay, when you record a tape the makeup of the tracks is like a signature for whatever did the recording
like a camcorder, VCR, whatever.
So the control track could tell us where it came from.
But to not have one...
I mean, that' s like being born without fingerprints.
Then, how did this get recorded?
I don' t know.
But I' m going to find out.
All right, take a look.
You should be able to see the camera here in the reflection.
Hmm.
What' s that?
It looks like she' s walking away whoever she is.
No, I mean up there at the top.
Oh, no, that' s just the tracking.
I can fix that.
Whup, sorry.
Wait, go back.
There' s something there.
Yeah, you' re right.
-- There' s more picture.
-- Hold on.
Yeah, it' s working.
Yeah, it won' t go any further.
Okay, keep going.
No, no, no, no, let me do it.
Wait, it won' t go any further.
-- Let me do it.
Oh...
Hey, Noah
I picked up the cameras.
They' re in really good shape.
Did you see the reprints I did of that Guatemala stuff?
'Cause they came out kind of... overexposed.
You working?
This is a friend, Rachel Keller.
She writes for the "P. I."
Rachel, this is Beth, my assistant.
Well, I prefer "partner in crime."
She' s a journalism student at Kirkland, actually.
I' m not even here.
Rachel is researching a story.
It' s this video hoax.
It' s sort of interesting.
So you know video.
Why don' t you come take a look at this thing with the tracking.
You know, I' m late.
Yeah, but why are you taking...?
I got to go.
It' s good to meet you.
So you' re taking the tape?
Whoa.
You don' t want her to see it?
What about me seeing it?
You had no problem showing it to me.
I did have a problem.
You' re angry.
Oh, no?
What are you then?
In a hurry.
Look, I' m sorry, but I' m not going to get all worked up over some high school rumor.
What are you thinking?
"You' re a flake, never finishes anything."
Needs to lighten up. "
Then I storm out all pissed off, kicking myself for ever thinking that you could just... grow up.
So, why don' t we just cut to that part right now and save ourselves a lot of grief?
Bye.
Watch out, missy.
Bad luck.
You don' t need that.
Becca.
So circle gets that square.
Do you remember anything about that night... that night with Katie?
Do you remember... how she died?
Becca?
She told you about a videotape, didn' t she?
She was afraid, wasn' t she?
Something was happening to her.
Becca... how did she die?
Please.
I need to know.
And you will.
She' il show you.
Who?
Who will show me?
Not now.
Four days.
Just don' t force her or she' il get pissy with you.
Your tracking, your monitor, your printer, if you need it.
So, uh... what are we watching, home movies or something?
I' d really rather watch it alone.
Really.
Whatever.
Come on...
Come on.
Lighthouse.
Shit.
Hello?
Somebody?
Something you needed help with?
Hey, you... you got a... ya...
Well, that seems to be the lot of it.
Thank you.
"Moesko Island."
"Anna Morgan."
Oh, my God.
"Mysterious Sickness Strikes Morgan Ranch Horses.
"Investigators search for answers after second horse drowning."
"Horses Recovering After Breeder' s Suicide."
"... suffered from hallucinations."
County Psychiatric. "
What happened to you, Anna?
$15. 33.
You' re gonna die.
My cousin was two packs a day.
Used the patch... never looked back.
Have a nice day.
You, too.
Sorry I' m late.
No problem.
Everything okay?
Oh, yeah.
He was an angel.
I- I... went in to tell him that it was bedtime and he was already under the covers.
And then he read me a bedtime story.
Yeah.
And then... he drew my picture.
Thanks.
Sure.
I' m sorry to call so late, but I need a favor.
I have to go upstate to do this story and I need you to watch Aidan for me.
Oh, Rachel, I don' t know.
How long will you be gone?
It' s just for two days, I promise.
This isn' t the best time for me.
Rachel?
Rachel, are you there?
Hold on a sec...
Rachel?
Is this about Katie?
Ruthie...
Aidan?
No!
Why, baby, why?
Why?!
I couldn' t sleep.
Who is she, Rachel?
Leave him alone!
Noah...
I need to talk to you, okay?
I...
I believe you.
He...
Who?
Who watched it?
Our son.
You took my picture.
I' ve seen you.
When I' m in the yard at school.
Rachel and I were...
Young.
Mom' s told me that story.
The thing is, I...
I don' t think I' d make a good father.
Maybe it was because my own was... such a... disappointment.
Be your father.
It' s a conundrum.
Yeah, it is.
Time to go, mister.
I' m not finished.
Noah said to make one for you.
You could almost draw a line through her life.
On one side, there' s this happy woman who spends her time with her husband, riding horses everything sheltered, protected and comfortable.
Her face, there' s... light, there' s pride.
And then, one day, something happens and she takes this hard corner and the light... goes out and then she ends up at Eola County Psychiatric all alone.
What happened to her?.
I don' t know yet but I think it has something to do with the horses.
It think we should go to the island together.
It' s Tuesday, Noah.
I only have one day left.
I need you to go to the hospital and find out as much as you can about Anna.
The images on the tape are leading us somewhere.
Katie saw them all, too.
I think... before you die you see the ring.
Shit!
Wait!
A daughter?
[Silence]
Where are they?
Dad!
Uncle Merrill!
Dad!
Morgan!
Bo?
Bo?
Bo, where' s Morgan?
Bo?
-- This is not a dr -- - Dad!
Morgan?
What' s happening?
The dogs were barking -- woke us up.
Are you hurt?
I think God did it.
Did what, Morgan?
And you can just have a word with him, and that' d be enough for me.
See, it was strange finding the crops that way.
The kids were confused by it, and, uh, it' d sure take the strangeness away, if I know it was just Lionel and the Wolfington brothers messing around, that' s all.
At the movies?
Are you sure?
All right, then.
Uh, thanks for your patience, Lee.
Bye.
Houdini peed.
I think he' s sick.
Why don' t you take him outside?
I' il call Dr. Crawford.
He doesn' t treat animals.
Well, he' il know what to do.
That was quick, Caroline.
I only called you folks two hours ago.
Old Mrs. Kendleman twisted her ankle, as she puts it, diving for her life when a bunch of school kids rode down the sidewalk on skateboards.
She went down to Thornton' s store this morning and started spitting on the new skateboards.
Spitting!
By the time I got there,
Mrs. Kendleman had sprayed the whole damned place.
And she must have had a cold or something.
I' m telling you, I won' t eat for a week.
So, what happened to your crops?
Dad' s gonna burn these again.
It' s contaminated.
You don' t even know what that word means.
It' s not contaminated.
It' s just tap water.
Pour it in his bowl.
It tastes funny.
And besides, he licks his butt every day.
I don' t think he' il mind.
Houdini?
Bo, don' t run.
What' s wrong, boy?
Stop it, Houdini.
Look at where it' s bent over, Father.
It' s not broken.
Now, what kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without breaking it?
Can' t be by hand.
It' s too perfect.
It doesn' t sound much like Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers.
They can' t take a piss without wetting the front of their pants.
I don' t think anyone else around here has had any problems.
I was over at Theo Henry' s farm yesterday afternoon, and he would have mentioned something.
Why were you at Theo' s place?
Some animals around the county have been acting funny -- and some of them violent.
What is it, a virus?
I don' t think so, Father.
They' re more odgy, you know, and alert.
It' s almost like they act when they smell a predator around -- peeing on themselves and everything.
Caroline... please stop calling me "Father."
What' s wrong?
I don' t hear my children.
He fell on me.
He wanted to kill Bo.
Did he hurt you?
No.
I' m so sorry, Morgan.
Where were you?
Houdini' s sick.
Tie lsabel up to the back of the shed, please, and make sure the knot' s very tight.
What' s the matter?
There' s a monster outside my room.
Can I have a glass of water?
What' s wrong with the water next to your bed?
It tastes old.
What are you thinking about?
Why do you talk to Mom when you' re by yourself?
Makes me feel better.
Does she ever answer back?
No.
She never answers me either.
What?
Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers are back.
It' s time for an ass- whupping.
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
Lee is a friend of mine.
This is his son.
Yeah, we' il be doing Lee a favor.
All right, listen -- we both go outside, move around the house in opposite directions.
We act crazy, insane with anger -- make them crap in their pants, force them around till we meet up on the other side.
Explain "act crazy."
You know, curse and stuff.
You want me to curse?
You don' t mean it.
It' s just for show.
What?
Well, it won' t be convincing.
It doesn' t sound natural when I curse.
Just make noises, then.
Explain "noises."
No, I' m not.
All right, you want them stealing something in the house next time?
-- All right.
2... 3!
I' m insane with anger!
We' re gonna beat your ass, bitch!
We' re gonna tear your head off!
I' m losing my mind!
It' s time for an ass- whupping!
I cursed.
I heard.
How did he get... [Rustling continues]
Are you sure this is Lionel Prichard?
You like that?
You got an old baby monitor around?
Bo had an old baby monitor.
-- Mm- hmm.
It only works one way, but that' il do fine.
That is, until someone gets you an old walkie- talkie left over at the station.
Stop! it' s hideous!
Get it off!
l- I know what to do.
Hey, Bo... turn that down till Officer Paski leaves.
Doy- da!
You' re too old to still be doing this.
You take a glass of water, and you finish it.
Now, what' s wrong with this one?
It has dust in it.
This one?
A hair.
This one?
Morgan took a sip, and it has his amebas in it.
So, how are you, Merrill?
Fine.
How is work at the gas station??
Stimulating.
I never got a chance to tell you, but l- I thought your moving in here with your brother after -- it was a nice thing to do.
Well, I don' t think I' m helping much.
You are.
Sorry.
Okay, so far I have, "It was very dark."
Yes, it was.
You can' t describe him at all?
Don' t you think that' s kind of odd?
A little.
I don' t know whether to look for a giant or a midget.
No, he definitely wasn' t a midget.
Okay.
So he was tall?
l- I would say so, yes.
Probably.
Over 6 feet?
It was very dark.
Yes, it was.
How certain are you that this was a male?
Oh, I don' t know -- I don' t know any girls who could run like that.
I don' t know, Merrill.
I' ve seen some of those women on the Olympics.
They can run like the wind.
This guy got on our roof in, like, a second.
O- Our roof is 10 feet high.
They have women' s high jumping in the Olympics.
They got these Scandinavian women who can jump clean over me.
Caroline, I know you' re making a point here, but I just don' t know what it is.
An out- of- town woman stopped by the diner yesterday afternoon and started yolling and cussing because they didn' t have her favorite cigarettes at the vending machine.
She scared a couple of the customers.
No one' s seen her since.
And my point is, we don' t know anything about the person you saw, and we should just keep all possibilities available.
Dad, where' s the remote?
I don' t know, baby.
Why don' t you check in the sofa cushions?
Excluding the possibility that a female Scandinavian Olympian was running around outside our house last night, what else might be a possibility?
I' m not done asking questions, and I don' t appreciate sarcasm.
Do you two have anyone who might have a grudge or something against you -- maybe a- a church member who -- who might not have like the fact that you left the church?
I don' t think so.
Okay, I was out of line with the whole female - Scandinavian- Olympian thing. it' s just I' m pretty strong, and I' m pretty fast.
And I was running as fact as I could, and this guy, he was -- he was just toying with us.
There' s only food under the sofa.
Baby, why don' t you just change the channel on the television?
And?
Same show' s on every station.
Every station??
Bo, turn up the volume.
Crop signs first emerged in the late '70s with renewed interest in extraterrestrial life.
They died out by the early '80s, dismissed as hoaxes.
This now resurgence is wholly different.
The speed and the quantity ln which it has appeared implies the coordination of hundreds of Individuals over many countries.
There are only a limited number of explanations.
Either this is one of the most elaborate hoaxes over created, or basically... it' s for real.
Extraterrestrials.
What in God' s name is going on?
I did some research after I saw your crops.
Two or three guys can make a design the size of the one in your field overnight using just boards and ropes.
Really?
That' s how these things have been done in the past.
But there are so many now.
How could so many people be in on it?
I can' t think straight.
I' m -- I' m gonna go back to the station and have a cup of Edgar' s coffee and -- and try to think clear.
And after that, I' il...
I might make some calls.
But I' il tell you something -- what I said in there, it still goes.
Your -- your family has been through a lot.
And the last thing these children need to do is worry about some crazy things happening in the world.
Now, take them into town and get their minds and your mind on everyday things, hmm?
Good medicine.
That' s good advice.
And you take care of yourself...
Graham.
The footage you' re watching was shot yesterday afternoon by a 34- year- old local cameraman in Bangalore a southern city of lndia. it' s the 18th reported crop sign found in that country in the last 72 hours.
Uncle Merrill, will you turn on the radio?
They are signs intended to be seen from the sky -- [Radio turns off]
Just for a while.
Book money?
Just one.
Bo back for pizza in 15.
It' s just a bunch of crock
They' re trying to sell sodas.
It' s plain and simple
Been watching these reports since morning.
I have seen 12 soda commercials so far -- 12!
You have any books on extraterrestrials?
Now, don' t tell me you believe this horse manure.
As a matter of fact, I think we have one.
Came by mistake in a shipment -- decided to keep it for the city people.
Last row, third book on the left, honey.
Why is no one saying the obvious?
These are just copycats.
Someone somewhere does the first one...
It was asthma medicine, right, Father?
For Morgan Hess.
And it' s not "Father" anymore.
ln less than an hour, a couple hundred people got the same brilliant idea, and here we are on the verge of mass hysteria.
Can I ask you a favor, Father?
I need to clear my conscience
Will you listen to me?
Tracey... l am not a reverend anymore.
I haven' t been for six months.
All this stuff on TV -- two girls came in here talking about the end of the world --
I' m just a little scared
Please, I need to clear my conscience.
I' ve got it figured.
You do?
I' ve had two separate folks tell me there have been strangers around these parts last couple nights.
'cause they' re staying in the shadows -- covertlike.
Nobody' s been hurt, mind you.
And that' s the giveaway.
I see. it' s called "probing." it' s a military procedure
You send out a reconnaissance group -- very small -- to check things out.
Not to engage but to evaluate the situation -- evaluate the level of danger, make sure things are all clear.
Clear for what?
For the rest of them.
You got a pamphlet or something I can read?
Sure.
Thanks.
You didn' t used to play baseball, did ya?
Shit, I know you.
You' re Merrill Hess.
I was there the day you hit that 507- footer over the left- field wall -- set the record.
Man, that thing had a motor on it.
It' s still the record, right?
Got the bat at home o- on the wall.
You' ve got two minor- league home- run records, don' t ya?
Five.
Why weren' t you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting your toes licked by beautiful women?
'Cause he has another record most people don' t know about
He has the minor- league strikeout record
Hello, Lionel.
Merrill' s a class- A screwup.
He would just swing that bat as hard as he could every time.
Didn' t matter what the coaches said, didn' t matter who was on base.
He would just whip that bat through the air as hard as he could.
Looked like a lumberjack chopping down a tree.
Merrill here has more strikeouts than any two players.
You really got the strikeout record?
Felt wrong not to swing.
It' s contaminated.
Carl, there' s something wrong with our water.
Your water' s fine.
Bo has this thing about her drinking water.
She had it her whole life.
It' s like a tick people have, except it' s not a tick.
ls that right?
13!
Don' t give me that so- so- soda
That same old cola
I wanna pop
-- Pop pop I wanna... Shasta -- I' il take it.
I cursed 37 times last week
I said the "F" word a couple times, but mostly... "shits" and... "bastards."
ls "douche bag" a curse?
I suppose that would depend on its usage.
How about, "John, you' re a douche bag for kissing Barbara"?
It' s a curse.
It' s 71.
Pharmacy crowded?
I don' t want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone.
ls that understood?
ls that him?
Yeah.
Who is he?
What is it?
Graham: it' s Bo' s baby monitor.
I found it in the basement.
I' m gonna use it as a walkie- talkie.
What if it' s catching a signal from them?
It' s not.
But it wasn' t working.
Morgan, this crop stuff is about a bunch of nerds who never had a girlfriend in their llves.
They' re, like, 30, and they work up little codes together, and they analyze Greek mythology and make up secret societies where other guys who never had girlfriends before can join in.
They do stupid crap like this to feel special.
It' s a scam.
Nerds were doing it 25 years ago, and now nerds are doing it again.
Turn it up.
See.
It' s a code.
Why can' t they got girlfriends?
Can I see that, please?
It' s noise.
It' s broken, Morgan.
It' s just gonna keep doing this.
Maybe some now batteries...
We might lose the signal.
This is exactly what the nerds want.
I' m getting out now.
Nobody move.
Voices.
Did you hear that?
Not English, though.
You heard the voices, right, Uncle Merrill?
I heard them, Morgan.
Probably picking up another baby monitor.
That' s right.
Let me see it.
Stop!
See, this is why we' re not watching TV.
People get obsessed.
I' m letting go now.
No Dad!
Don' t do it!
You' il lose the signal.
Don' t let go.
It gets clearer the higher you hold it.
I got it.
Bo, honey, I don' t want you climbing on the car.
Come here.
Stop!
There' s two of them talking.
lsabel, you' re gonna feel very silly when this turns out to be all just make- believe.
You' re wasting your time here!
I' m not gonna report this or anything you do to my crops to the news or TV or anybody!
You' re not going to get famous!
Okay.
Let' s turn on the TV.
It first appeared 52 minutes ago.
Mexico City officials as well as U. S. officials have confirmed that these are not aircraft from either government' s air force
The first sighting was made by an Air Mexico 747 en route from Mazatlán to New York as the unidentified crafts entered Mexico City air space
-- The nerds were right.
We have to tape this.
My ballet recital.
Listen, Bo, this is very important.
Everything people have written about in science books is going to change.
The history of the world' s future is on the TV right now.
We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there.
For your children, Bo.
My ballet recital.
Dad!
Find another tape.
Uncle Merrill, I' m using your tape.
You are seeing a live feed from our affiliate down here ln Mexico City.
This image has not been adjusted or enhanced ln any way.
What you' re seeing is real.
-- Everything they wrote ln science books is about to change.
I told you.
Some people are probably thinking this is the end of the world.
That' s true.
Do you think it could be?
Yes.
How can you say that?
That wasn' t the answer you wanted?
Couldn' t you pretend to be like you used to be?
Give me some comfort.
People break down into two groups when they experience something lucky.
Group number one sees it as more than luck, more than coincidence.
They see it as a sign -- evidence that there is someone up there watching out for them.
Group number two sees it as just pure luck, a happy turn of chance.
I' m sure the people in group number two are looking at those 14 lights in a very suspicious way.
For them, the situation isn' t 50- 50.
Could be bad, could be good.
But deep down, they feel that whatever happens, they' re on their own.
And that fills them with fear.
Yeah, there are those people.
But there' s a whole lot of people in the group number one.
When they see those 14 lights, they' re looking at a miracle.
And deep down, they feel that whatever' s going to happen, there' il be someone there to help them.
And that fills them with hope.
See, what you have to ask yourself is, what kind of person are you?
Are you the kind who sees signs, sees miracles?
Or do you believe that people just got lucky?
Or look at the question this way -- is it possible that there are no coincidences?
I was at this party once.
I' m on the couch with Randa McKinney.
looking beautiful, staring at me.
I go to lean in and kiss her... and I realize I have gum in my mouth.
So I turn, take out the gum, stuff it in a paper cup next to the sofa, and turn around.
Randa McKinney throws up all over herself.
I know the second it happened it was a miracle.
I could have been kissing her when she throw up.
That would have scarred me for life.
I may never have recovered.
I' m a miracle man.
Those lights are a miracle.
There you go.
So, which type are you?
Do you feel comforted
Yeah, I do.
Then what does it matter?
I never told you the last words that Colleen said before they let her die.
She said, "See."
Then her eyes glazed a bit.
And then she said, "Swing away."
You know why she said that?
Because the nerve endings in her brain were firing as she died, and some random memory of us at one of your baseball games just popped into her head.
There is no one watching out for us, Merrill.
We are all on our own.
What do you know?
Well, there was an accident -- drunk driving, they weren' t sure --
He wasn' t drunk.
-- Yeah.
That was the first thing Colleen asked, too.
She' s talking.
What ambulance is she in?
She' s not in an ambulance, Father.
For the kids' protection.
All they were doing was watching TV from 5: 00 a. m.
I felt like they were getting obsessed, like you said.
They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something.
What' s furry, furry rabbit?
It' s a game, isn' t it?
Anyways, they closed the schools.
And there' s been some interesting developments.
What time is it?
11: 00 a. m.
They' re gone, but they' re not really gone.
We just can' t see them.
Early this morning, a bird flow into the area where the lights were hovering last night.
It stopped dead in the air and fell straight down.
They caught it on tape.
They' ve been playing it all morning.
The footag e looks like the bird flow into a wall in the sky.
They found the bird.
His -- his head was crushed in.
They think they have some kind of invisible- shield thing going, l- like an optical illusion.
They' re still there, hovering.
All over the place, over us, even.
There' s a theory about the c -- the crop circles.
They could be some kind of -- some kind of landmark, visual mapping system so they could navigate, coordinate -- makes sense.
Want to hear a story?
Is it true?
So the aliens can' t read our minds.
They tell you everything in this book.
It says they' re probably very small, like my height, because as their brains develop, there was no use for physical development.
It also says they' re probably vegetarians becauso they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.
Who wrote this book?
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
That means they' re unemployed.
lf you' re gonna make fun of it, then forget it.
This is serious.
I don' t know what got into me.
There are pictures.
Dr. Bimbu, one of the authors of the book --
I just asked his name.
You had a tone.
He said there are two reasons why extraterrestrials would visit us -- to make contact in the spirit of exploration and furthering the knowledge of the universe, or the other reason -- they' re hostile.
They' ve used up all the resources on their planet, and they' re looking to harvest our planet next.
Here.
Looks a little like our house doesn' t it?
Same windows.
That' s welrd
Yeah, oh, yeah.
That' s enough from Dr. Bimbu for now.
Everybody in this house needs to calm down and eat some fruit or something.
Hello?
Father?
Hello?
Hello?!
I' m going out for a few minutes.
No one leaves this house -- no one.
Ray Reddy' s house.
Why?
I think he just called here.
You don' t think something bad will happen, do you, Morgan?
Why?
You have one of your feelings again?
ls it bad?
I won' t let anything bad happen to you.
I don' t want you to die.
Who said I was gonna die?
Who said I was gonna die?
Hello, Ray.
What happened?
I wrote your number down to call you.
It' s been sitting next to the phone for 6 months.
When I know it was inside the house...
I couldn' t thlnk of any other number to call.
I panicked.
Thank you for coming, Father.
You' re welcome, Ray.
I worked so long that night.
I' ve never fallen asleep driving before... never since.
Don' t.
Most of the ride home, there wasn' t a car in sight in either direction.
I would have ended up ln a ditch with a headache.
And it had to be at that right moment -- that 10, 15 seconds when I passed her walking.
It was like it was meant to be.
I' m screwed, right?
People who kill reverends' wives aren' t exactly ushered to the front of the line in Heaven.
Wh -- Where are you going, Ray?
To the lake.
The way I see it... these places marked in crops and such -- none of them are really near water.
I don' t think they like water.
Can' t be any worse than here.
Did you see something, Ray?
I know what I' ve done to you.
I made you question your faith.
I' m truly sorry for what I' ve done to you and yours.
All right.
And don' t open my pantry, Father.
I found one of them in there and locked him in.
The startling footage we' re about to show you was photographed by a 42- year- old, Romero Valadarez.
This video was taken yesterday afternoon at his son' s 7th birthday
In the city of Passo Fundo, Brazil.
It was sent to the local news bureau there and sent to us via satellite just a few minutes ago.
All initial opinions are this is genuine.
What you' re about to see may disturb you.
Move, children!
Vámanos!
Hello?
The police are here.
I am with them.
I am a police officer.
I just want to talk with you.
We know all about the hoax.
We already took some of your friends downtown in a paddy wagon.
Just tell us your name and why you did it, and we' il give you the same deal we gave the others.
Don' t throw your life away, son.
Their skin changes colors.
That' s why we couldn' t see them that night.
Tell me something, Morgan.
Uh... in this book of yours... did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
Yes.
It said they would probably invade.
'cause they know eventually we would use nuclear weapons.
Then the planet would be useless to them.
How could anyone possibly know that information?? it' s ridiculous.
What else did it say?
They said there are one of two outcomes of an invasion.
One, they fight and are defeated and have to return again with full forces hundreds, maybe even thousands, of years later.
What' s two?
They win.
I' m sorry, what -- what book is this?
ls this really happening?
I heard a theory that, uh, they don' t like places near water.
Maybe we' d be safe from them near a lake or something.
Sounds made- up.
I saw one of them at Ray Reddy' s house.
I can' t be sure, but I got the distinct feellng he wanted to harm me.
So... we can choose to believe this lake idea, pack up, and go, or we can stay here, hide inside our home, wait it out.
We might be overreacting, but I' m willing to live with that.
Either way, at least we' il be together.
All those in favor of the lake idea, raise your hand.
All those in favor of home, raise your hand.
Okay.
My vote counts as two.
That' s bullshit!
You' re cheating!
Morgan, calm down.
I got two votes because I represent two parents here.
We don' t know anything yet.
We' il be safe here anyway.
I don' t want to leave home.
This is where we lived with Mom.
That' s got nothing to do with this.
I change my vote.
You can' t change your vote.
All those in favor of home, raise your hand.
This is ridiculous.
You lose, 3- 2.
We' re going to board up every window in this house.
How do we know boards will do anything?
Because they seem to have trouble with pantry doors.
The lnformation we' re receiving comes from our affiliates across the world.
Dad, Uncle Merrill!
Amman joins Nairobi, Beijing, and Jerusalem as the latest to confirm the appearance of lights.
There are lights in over 274 cities.
They think it' il be 400 within the hour.
They' re appearing at or within one mile of crop signs.
They were for navigation.
They made a map.
They' re gonna be within a mile of us.
Dad?
Yes?
They think these are staged immediately preceding an attack maneuver.
I was wrong.
They' re hostile.
It' s like "War of the Worlds."
ln countries throughout the globe [Clears throat]
Hundreds of thousands have flocked to temples, synagogues, and churches.
God be with us all.
I' m going to got back to the windows.
Hey, you guys okay?
Some guy had a sign saying it was the end of the world.
Don' t worry.
You won' t let anything happen to us, right?
No way.
I wish you were my dad.
What did you say?
Don' t you over say anything like that again.
Ever.
There' s too many windows in the bedrooms.
We don' t have enough boards.
We' il board up the bedroom doors.
Where are we gonna sleep?
ln the family room.
What about lsabel?
We' il tie her up in the garage after dinner.
I' il make some sandwiches.
I want spaghetti.
We' il just eat fast, Bo.
Spaghetti sounds great.
What do you want, Morgan?
Anything?
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
Now we' re talking.
How about you, Merrill?
Chicken toriyaki.
Good choice.
I' m going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.
Extra bacon.
What' s the matter with everyone?
Maybe we should say a prayer.
No.
Why not?
We' re not saying a prayer.
Bo has a bad feeling.
I had a dream.
We aren' t saying a prayer.
Eat!
I hate you.
That' s fine.
You let Mom die.
Morgan.
I am not wasting one more minute of my life on prayer.
Not one more minute.
Understood?
Now we are going to enjoy this meal.
-- Graham...
All right, since you' re all not gonna eat.
I' m gonna try some of everything.
It' s happening.
Graham, hurry.
Did I ever tell you what everyone said when you were born, Bo?
You came out of your mama, and you didn' t even cry.
You just opened your eyes, and you looked around the room at everybody.
Your eyes were so big and gorgeous.
All the ladies in the room just gasped.
I mean, they literally gasped.
And they go, "Oh, she' s like an angel."
And they said, "We' ve never seen a baby so beautiful."
And then... you know what happened?
They put you on the table to clean you up, and you looked up at me and you smiled.
They say babies that young can' t smile.
You smiled.
Let' s go down now.
We forgot lsabel.
Should we turn off the lights?
They already know we' re here.
Dad... [Rapid footsteps]
Do you know what happenod when you were born, Morgan?
You came out, and your mama kept bleeding, so the doctors rushed you out of the room before I even had time to see you.
They' re on the roof.
While they were fixing her up, all she kept asking about was you.
They' re in the house.
I wanted your mama to see you first because she had dreamed about you her whole life.
Then she got feeling better, they brought you in, and they placed you in her arms, and she looked at you, and you looked at her, and you just stared at each other for the longest time.
And then she said real soft,
"Hello, Morgan.
I' m your mama.
You look just how I dreamed. "
The attic door.
Come on.
We forgot our foil helmets.
Have we got anything to wedge against the door knob?
They' il read our minds
You' re scaring your sister.
I' m already scared.
Merrill.
I' m looking!
They' il know our secret thoughts.
I' m not ready.
Merrill!
-- Dad!
Where' s Bo?
I' m okay.
What' s happening out there?
I can' t even imagine
I hope they' re doing better than we are.
We don' t even have helmets.
They' re only making noises.
They' re not trying to get in.
Why would they do that?
They want our attention on the door?
They' re distracting us.
From what?
The book says they' re probably very good problem solvers.
They' il find a way in.
Morgan, give me your flashlight.
They used to pour coal down in this basement.
There' s a coal chute in here.
I can feel air.
Me too!
It' s getting stronger.
I' m close.
What?
Hold him!
I got him!
Hold him!
I got him!
Hold him!
We don' t have his medicine.
Don' t be afraid, Morgan.
We' il slow this down together.
Feel my chest.
Feel it moving in and out.
Breathe like me.
Breathe like me.
Come on.
I dreamed this.
Stay with me.
I know it hurts.
Be strong, baby.
It' il pass.
It' il pass.
Don' t do this to me again.
Not again.
I hate you.
I hate you.
The fear is feeding him.
Don' t be afraid of what' s happening.
Believe it' s going to pass Believe it.
Just wait Don' t be afraid
The air is coming.
Believe.
We don' t have to be afraid it' s about to pass
Here it comes Don' t be afraid
Here comes the air.
Don' t be afraid, Morgan.
Feel my chest.
Breathe with me.
Together.
The air is going in our lungs.
Together.
We' re the same.
We' re the same.
We should save the flashlights.
Ray' s truck swerved off the road and hit Colleen and then a tree, and she was pinned between the two.
What does that mean -- pinned?
The truck -- the truck has severed most of her lower half.
What did you say?
She won' t be saved.
'cause we -- we wanted you to come down here and be with her as long as she' s awake.
And that won' t be very long.
Now, Father, do you understand what I' ve told you?
Caroline... is this the last time I' m gonna talk with my wife?
Yes, it is.
People thlnk they came here to take over the planet
That' s bull.
I don' t thlnk that.
I found a pack of light bulbs.
They poisoned his family.
They dragged them away.
Nobody helieves it, but they didn' t come here for our planet
This is a raid.
They came here for us, to harvest us.
We' re lucky as hell they' re leaving here.
They' re leaving?
That' s what they' re saying.
How long have we been sleeping?
12 hours or so [Radio turns off]
He said they had poison gas... they secrete in small amounts.
A lot of people died.
But they' re leaving.
like something scared them off.
They left some of their wounded behlnd.
Why are they going?
People must have figured out a way to beat them.
Everyone has a weakness, right?
You didn' t think we' d make it through the night, did you?
No.
Listen... there' s things I can take and a couple things I can' t.
One of them I can' t take is when my older brother, who' s everything I want to be... starts losing faith in things.
I saw your eyes last night.
I don' t want to ever see your eyes like that again.
Okay?
I' m serious.
Okay.
He' s been like that for a while.
He needs his medicine.
Have they said anything about our area?
Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared... but who knows for sure?
He' s not strong enough.
lf he has another attack right now --
I know.
We' d have to be sure before we open up that door, Graham.
It' s good enough for me.
Me too.
Get the syringes as well.
We may need to give him an epinephrine shot.
-- They' re doing this on TV.
There' s a great sense of relief.
-- Yeah, like this.
As we begin evaluating the loss of life
-- We will be left with a lot of questions.
-- I see the same expression on every face
We know the battle turned around ln the Middle East.
Three small cities there found a primitive method to defeat them.
We have no further details at this time.
Merrill, wait.
Hi, sweetie.
Hi, baby.
I was... just taking a walk before dinner.
You love walks.
It was meant to be.
Does it hurt?
I don' t feel much.
Good.
Tell Morgan... to play games.
It' s okay to be silly.
I will.
Tell Bo to listen to her brother.
He' il always take care of her.
I will.
And tell Graham --
I' m here.
Tell him... see.
Tell him to see.
And tell Merrill to swing away.
See, what you have to ask yourself is, what kind of person are you?
Are you the kind that sees signs, sees miracles?
Or do you believe that people just get lucky?
Is it possible... there are no coincidences?
Swing away, Merrill.
Merrill... swing away.
That' s why he had asthma.
It can' t be luck.
His lungs were closed.
His lungs were closed.
No poison got in.
No poison got in.
His lungs were closed.
His lungs were closed.
Don' t touch him.
Give him a minute.
Graham...
Give him a second.
D- Daddy...
Don' t touch him.
Graham...
Don' t... don' t.
Dad?
What happened?
Did someone save me?
Yeah, baby, I think someone did.
No talking in the ranks, Karlberg!
Let' s maintain proper behaviour in the ranks, boys.
– You' re not allowed here. – But I want to see you.
– Can I ask you something? – Yes. – Will you come and watch tomorrow? – Do you want me to?
– Will you win? – lf you come I' il win.
Do you have the guts?
The winner of the 200 metre freestyle is Erik Ponti from class 3: 5.
So now there' s only the 300 metre freestyle left.
What are you doing to do? – What do you mean? – Are you going for it?
Should I let Lewenheusen win?
More sportsmanlike not to enter the race!
This is not about being sportsmanlike.
Haven' t you understood that? – This is Stjärnsberg. – Hey, boys!
Just thought I' d check that no one falls before the last hurdle.
We' ve got them!
Be careful not to get disqualified at the start. – Everything has already been decided. – For that very reason.
Show them! – What' il happen if I win? – You' il be untouchable.
I promise.
It' s a matter of honour for me.
Go.
The over– all champion and holder of three new school records, Erik Ponti!
Hello there... – l' m decorating the tree. – l can see that.
I can see that you' re decorating the tree.
Erik...
My darling, welcome home.
I' ve missed you so much!
How is my little boy?
You look so grown up. – Doesn' t he?
But what the hell is he wearing?
You look like a tram driver.
You look lovely, really lovely.
Look. – But what happened to you there? – Nothing.
It' s wonderful.
We' il keep it here.
Are you hungry?
We' il be eating in a minute.
Venison.
This is very good.
How many straight A' s have you got?
But what the hell is all this?
C for Behaviour?
How does our "Stjärnsbergian" explain that?
Has it got something to do with all the weekend detentions?
Just think, you won the school championships in swimming.
But my dear, that' s not what we' re bloody talking about, is it?
Do you have an explanation?
What did you want to be then? – Left in peace. – What?
Left in peace.
ln peace...
So you thought your mother should sell off her heirlooms – – so you could be left in peace. – ls that it? – No.
That' s not what you meant.
What then?
How many do you want, Erik?
Thank you.
Look how wonderful it looks.
Pommes duchesse, marvellous.
Erik, you know whenever there' s something I don' t understand – – we have to have a talk after dinner.
That' s what we' il do.
But... have some, darling, start.
Haricots verts... how delicious!
There we are...
– We' re friends again. – Friends again...
Marja!
Marja!
– Hello, Pierre. – Thanks for the record.
Sounds good! – What' s this? – Open.
lf you' re going to be a lawyer you' il need one of these.
Not that it applies in this school, but nonetheless.
School rules shouldn' t be above the law of the land, should they?!
No, thanks.
Come here.
Understood?
How did it go?
What did they say? – Three weekend detentions. – Why?
I gave them lip, refused the pepperpot.
The next time: the ring!
"No fun thumping a coward and an intellectual."
Room search!
Stand up straight, Tanguy! – What the hell are you doing? – Stand up straight, Tanguy!
Stand up straight, Tanguy!
Look at me!
Good.
It looks like we have a bed– wetter here.
Be ready in an hour, Tanguy!
They' re trying to get at you.
They' ve just changed their tactics.
Good day, sir!
– Good day, sir! – Erik!
– l' ve got an idea about the training. – l' m not going to swim any more. – What?
You can' t do that. – Yes I can.
But... you' re the best swimmer we' ve ever had.
That it was a matter of honour for you.
You know that.
Wait.
I' m sorry, Erik.
It' s not possible.
Rat!
Come up for an inspection.
Rat! ln here.
Good that you could come, Rat.
We need an independent witness.
Fatty here is just about to admit he' s been smoking on the sly. – No! lf you hit him, you' il be expelled. – That' s quite right.
Smoking indoors is also enough for immediate expulsion.
Paragraph 7.
Who' s going to prove that?
A rat and a pig?
Shit, Dahlén, it' s like a bloody zoo in here!
Now about that confession.
It' s about time you stubbed out your cigarette for good.
Stub it out, you coward!
What?
With any bloody permission you like.
You haven' t got the guts, have you?
Get dressed, Tanguy!
Present yourself in the ring tomorrow at 19. 00.
You know...
None of this really needs to happen.
That' s what rules are for.
Why should your friend have to suffer – – just because you think you are above everyone else.
You should give some thought to that.
Come on.
He' s an evil human being.
Was he born like that or has he been here too long, maybe beaten as well...
That' s how the system works, isn' t it?
Revenge later on...
That' s why it just continues.
Someone like him must never win.
Not now or ever.
That' s it!
– Have you seen Pierre? – No. – Have you seen Pierre? – No. – Have you seen Pierre?! – Not since the maths class.
ls it true he' s been called to the ring tonight?
I' ve already decided.
– l' m going to do it. – Why?
Otherwise it' il just carry on. lf I do it now, maybe they' il leave me alone.
"Might as well get it out of the way."
Not a bit, more than you can imagine!
I' ve been fighting my whole life, and once you' ve done that it never ends.
But help me then.
Am I too weak?
It' s completely different.
Something in your head.
You don' t seem to understand.
How do you know I will?
Get beaten up...
You' re not the only one who can fight.
What?
Do you think you' re better than me?
You like putting yourself above the rest of us.
Because you keep quiet when they burn you with a cigarette.
It doesn' t matter what you say.
FlGHT, FlGHT, FlGHT!
Pierre Tanguy, come and get your punishment!
Come on, Tanguy!
Come on, little Piggy!
TANGUY, TANGUY, TANGUY!
Will you do as you' re told from now on, or carry on being cheeky?
– Do you promise to do as you' re told? – No, you coward, you bloody swine! – What did you call me? – A swine!
One more time?
On your knees!
Get down on your knees!
Never!
– What' s the time? – Almost 9. – Have you had any sleep? – Yes, a bit.
You got in a good punch there.
Have you been practising on the quiet?
No.
I just lashed out, sort of.
I' il have a word with Silverhielm.
This is going to stop.
I have to go to my house arrest now.
See you tonight.
Will you be okay?
Erik...
Yes, see you later.
One of the boys in 2: 5 is sick, so you must do his punishment duties. – But I have to go up to house arrest. – Don' t give me lip!
Here...
These have to be put into the ground in a 2x2 metre square.
Firm as a rock! – Then you can go to your arrest. – Yes.
Get to work!
You can go and have some food now.
Let me go!
Let me go!
I hope you put the stakes in properly.
We' il take your dick last of all.
Are you scared?
I' m never going to be scared of you, "Shittyhielm."
Start with the warm water.
Pour it on!
LE' TS BOlL RAT!
– Pour it on!
Pour it! – l don' t want to!
Looks like you need cooling down, Rat! – Cold water!
We can' t leave him there.
You shut up!
– Are you cold? – Yes, a little.
Dear Erik, by the time you read this letter, I' il have left Stjärnsberg.
Don' t think I' m a coward.
I tried to hold out for as long as I could.
There is so much I want to say, but the taxi is coming in a minute.
Anyway, I want you to know that you' re the best friend I' ve ever had.
lf you like you can write to me at my mother' s address in Stockholm.
Your affectionate friend, Pierre.
PS.
I didn' t have space for my works of Strindberg and the gramophone.
Please make full use of them.
Come in!
– Hello, Erik. – Hello.
– Am I disturbing? – No.
No.
The rumours are flying.
Nothing.
Very sad about Pierre.
It really is.
What kind of freaks are you?
Don' t you understand what you' ve done?
Pierre was one of the most gifted students we' ve ever had here.
You and he were close friends, Erik.
Couldn' t you have defended him?
Why didn' t you defend him?
At least give me an answer!
Are you as cowardly as the others?
You get expelled if you fight with a council member.
The ability to know the difference between good and evil.
Like vultures.
It' s undignified!
Do you hear me?
Undignified!
This has to stop.
I don' t think sir understands exactly what' s happened here.
That' il be all for today.
Thank you.
The ring in one hour.
Bring von Schenken with you.
After much deliberation, Rat has decided to accept the challenge.
Teach him a lesson in the true spirit of Stjärnsberg.
You may start.
I' ve got a question.
Do I have to hit both or is it enough if one crawls out?
Just one more question.
Can I hit them as much as I like? – Fight! – l was thinking about you, Dahlén.
I thought I might break your nose. – And you!
I' il break your left arm at the elbow.
Don' t talk so bloody much, Rat!
We said the nose, didn' t we?
Crawl!
You too.
Crawl!
I' d like to talk to Marja.
Can you ask her to come out?
– Marja doesn' t work here any more. – What?
She got fired.
Three days ago.
For what?
This gives us "hidden wedding" or "hidden fertilization".
Erik... – Erik! – Yes? – Are you alright? – l' m fine.
And then we have the other group, phanerogams...
Von Leiven.
Vinberg.
Ponti.
Ponti has a letter from Finland.
Room search!
I found it!
This is even better than I thought.
"Don' t worry about me getting with child with you."
That prostitute can' t even put it in proper Swedish! "With child with you!"
"I had my diaphragm on." The stopper on her head, not in her cunt?!
Eh?
"But I suppose it' s both of our fault."
"Maybe it' s true I love you, but not that I think we' il meet again."
I don' t think so either!
You' ve fucked the kitchen whore!
When the headmaster sees this you' il be expelled straight away!
Stretch your legs a bit!
And now sit down, gentlemen. – Not you, Ponti!
Go to the headmaster straight away!
Take your things!
Gentlemen!
It' s November, the 6th of November to be precise, 1632, Lützen.
Dense fog before us.
Come in.
lf I understand things right, you' ve been having long– term problems...... finding your feet at Stjärnsberg.
ls that right?
Well, the school rules are very clear on these matters.
I have no alternative but to expel you without matriculating from your year.
I would prefer to have you off school premises – – shall we say by 1 5. 00 tomorrow.
It' s my duty to inform your parents – – but I assume you' d prefer to have a word with them first.
The letter, may I have it back?
– What are you going to do with it? – Her address.
I' d like to write to her.
The best thing you can do know is to forget about that girl.
One thing I want you to know...
Maybe it' s true I love you, but not that I think we' il meet again.
Stop!
Only members of this school are allowed to eat here.
Hello?
Who is it?
Erik, is it you?
It' s just the two of us now, Silverhielm.
It' s 2 kilometres to the stable and even further to the school.
You could make a run for it.
You' re fairly quick.
lf you go now, it' il take me 100 metres to catch up with you. – What the hell are you talking about? – Down on your knees! – You' re bloody mad. – l said, down on your knees!
Money?
I' il give you 10 000.
My word! – 1 0 000?! ls that all you' re worth? – l' il give it to you tomorrow. – l swear on my honour as a nobleman. – Your honour as a nobleman?
You did everything to provoke me.
And the teeth, of course.
You won' t enjoy having all your teeth out, but you won' t feel a thing...
Are you mad?
They' il give you a life sentence in prison.
No proof once I' ve burnt your clothes!
I won' t tell anyone else.
Did you really think I was going to kill you?
I' m not like you, Silverhielm.
I' m not like you.
Three cheers...
Dear colleagues...
I' m extremely moved by all this kindness.
And I' d very much like to say on behalf of my wife and myself...
I think we have a visitor.
Still here?
I thought we had concluded any remaining business. – lt was the thing about the letter. – Maybe I didn' t make myself clear.
What are you trying to say?
Leave the school premises immediately! – Do you hear? – Excuse me if I' m interrupting things. – Who are you? – This is my lawyer.
The name is Ekengren.
Good day to you, gentlemen.
Well, this is a rather sorry tale for everyone involved, you might say.
Who happens to work for this newspaper.
He was very interested to hear about Erik' s story.
And perhaps flesh out Erik' s story a bit more.
However, you may not feel this sort of publicity will be of benefit...
Perhaps we could...
The legal implications are already clearly set out here.
I don' t know what you think, Erik?
Could we possibly avoid making this a police matter? – Maybe. – Excuse me, what is all this about?
lf all the information has not been squarely placed in front of me, then...
Surely Headmaster has access to all the information?
As I say, if there are certain circumstances – – to which I have not been alerted – – then naturally I would like to be told of them.
lf you' il all excuse me.
Have some cake in the meantime! – Alma...
May I have it back?
Thanks.
Behave for the rest of the term and get in touch when you come back.
It' s not my hope but rather my conviction – – that you' il go into life bearing something – – that we proudly call the Stjärnsberg spirit.
Now it all begins.
Good luck!
Erik, if you see Pierre give him my regards.
Erik, take care of yourself.
With these reports you' il get into any Sixth Form college you like.
But a D in General Behaviour!
ls that heading in the right direction?
And now you have a D.
What' s your explanation?
She was a waitress, just like you.
We' il talk this over after dinner.
What' s the matter with you?
What are you staring at?
What the hell are you staring at?
What are you staring at?
You' re coming with me!
Erik!
I' m sorry.
It' s over.
You' re getting out of here.
ln half an hour you' re going to be in hospital.
You won' t see, your nose will be snapped, your arms will be broken.
You won' t dare tell anyone.
You' il say that you fell down the stairs.
lf you get the police involved, they' il find out what you' ve been doing to us.
This is going to hurt a hell of a lot.
You' il be screaming until you pass out.
I swear I' m really going to do it.
People like you have to be destroyed.
This is the last time, then never again.
I thought you' d be in Savolaks by now. – Where are you going? – To Geneva.
Business. – l thought you wanted to write. – Many things one wants to do!
You?
I' ve got a job in a legal firm over the summer.
As a messenger boy. – l have to pay for my private tuition. – Forget that.
We' re friends. – lt makes no difference to me. – Because you' re rich.
– l' il be seeing you, Erik. – l' il be seeing you, Pierre.
Help me get near him.
This way.
This way, Mother.
Mother...
Mother...
I' m here...
I' m here...
See, Mother, I make all things new.
Who is that?
Who?
She' s the Galilean' s mother.
Let' s go.
Come on!
Don' t fret, my daughter.
Don' t fret.
Are you blind?
Can' t you see, he can' t go on?
Help him!
You!
Yes, you!
Get over here!
What do you want from me?
This criminal can' t carry his cross by himself anymore.
You will help him!
Now get going!
I can' t do that.
It' s none of my business.
Get someone else!
Help him!
He is a holy man.
Let' s go!
All right, but I' m an innocent man, forced to carry the cross of a condemned man.
Stay here.
Wait for me.
Permit me, my Lord.
Who do you think you are?
Get away from here.
Impossible people!
Someone stop this!
Stop!
Stop!
Leave him alone!
If you don' t stop, I won' t carry that cross one more step.
I don' t care what you do to me!
All right, all right, let' s get moving.
We don' t have all day.
Let' s go!
Let' s go...... Jew!
Almost there.
We' re nearly there.
Almost done.
You have heard it said...... you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.
But I say to you...... love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you...
For if you love only those who love you...
... what reward is there in that?
I am the good shepherd.
I lay down my life for my sheep.
No one takes my life from me...... but I lay it down of my own accord.
I have power to lay it down...... and power to take it up again.
This command is from my Father.
Get away now, you' re free to go.
Go on!
You can get up now!
Get up, your majesty.
Can' t you get up?
We haven' t got all day.
Come on, move!
We' re ready.
Get up, your highness.
You are my friends.
There is no greater love than for a man to lay down his life for his friends.
I cannot be with you much longer, my friends.
You cannot go where I am going.
My commandment to you after I am gone is this...
Love one another.
As I have loved you, so love one another.
You believe in me.
You know that I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life.
And no one comes to the Father but by me.
Further out...
Idiots!
Let me show you how to do it.
Like this!
There!
Hold the hand open like this.
Father, forgive them...
Father, Father my Father... my God...
They don' t know... they don' t know...
Stupid mongrels!
Turn the wood over on its face, idiots!
Take this and eat.
This is my body which is given up for you.
Take this and drink.
This is my blood of the new covenant...... which is given for you and for many, for the forgiveness of sins.
Do this in memory of me.
If you are the son of God, why don' t you save yourself?
Prove to us you are who you say you are.
You said you could destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days...... and yet you cannot come down from that cross.
If he is the Messiah...... I say let him come down from the cross...... so that we may see and believe.
Father, forgive them...... they know not what they do.
Listen...... he prays for you.
We deserve this, Gesmas, but he does not.
I have sinned, and my punishment is just.
You would be justified in condemning me.
I ask only that you remember me, Lord, when you enter your kingdom.
Amen, I tell you, on this day you shall be with me in paradise.
I thirst.
Flesh of my flesh...... heart of my heart...
My son, let me die with you.
Woman...... behold your son.
Son, behold...
... your mother.
There is no one left.
No one, Jesus!
My God...
... why have you forsaken me?
It is accomplished.
I commend... my spirit.
Cassius!
Hurry!
He' s dead!
Make sure!
As it is in Heaven.
My dear, sweet, Daniel...
You never have to be afraid of those boys, ever again.
We won' t go on living here.
I' il find you another school.
Pappa would have supported me in this, if he had been alive.
Everything is for the best.
Just believe that, and all will be fine.
When I grow up I' m going to marry you, mommy.
- that would open people' s hearts.
That was my dream.
At 14, I was to compete at the Junior Soloist World Championships.
A day I will always remember.
For the first time in my life my calendar was completely empty.
The doctor said it was a heart attack.
It wasn' t fatal, but he didn' t give me much hope.
"Your heart' s completely worn out."
Jump!
I don' t know why I returned to the village of my childhood.
Sometimes you do things without knowing why.
I reckoned that no one in the village would know that I' d once lived here.
My agent had given me a new name when I was 15.
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
"Remember to let the tap run before drinking."
"The water comes from our own well."
I heard... you' d bought the old school here.
I thought I' d drop by.
I' m Stig Berggren, the village Pastor.
I wanted to be the first to welcome you.
It' s my little custom to give each newcomer a Bible.
In the name of Jesus Christ.
Thank you.
I arrived 25 years ago and we ended up staying, my wife and I.
Just think, Daniel Daréus here in our old school.
But one can only wonder, what will you do here?
- I shall listen.
My wife Inger and I wonder if you' d care to come to our home for dinner.
Thank you, but I prefer to be alone.
Perhaps he could hold a concert here in the village.
I' ve stopped performing!
Though the church is really very beautiful.
There' s Conny from the garage with my gun.
I saw your car, and thought...
Here' s your gun.
I' ve checked it out, it works fine now.
- I welded the barrel.
- Thank you so much.
Was that you in the taxi?
That was me who skidded past in the truck.
It' s a she...
Bulls- eye, right up her ass.
- My Christmas hare for the church.
World famous.
Daniel Daréus.
One of those artist types, huh?
- Has Olga laughed today?
- What?
Isn' t your hearing aid on?
- Has Olga laughed today?
- What have you got today, Lena?
This Norwegian and a Swede are watching a funeral procession.
The Swede asks:
"Who' s the dead one?"
"Don' t know", says the Norwegian, "but I think that' s him in the coffin."
- I' il put down the 65 crowns.
- Fine.
Are you the one who bought the old school?
Yes.
Everyone has to eat.
Would you listen to this?
See if it' s good enough.
Want a Bingo lottery ticket?
Everyone plays "bingolotto" around here.
We had a winner once.
This is for you.
Sure, we can handle just about anything.
See ya!
He wanted a bottle of Jamaican, only thing that turns his girl on.
24 speeds.
Only 5, 800 crowns.
A lot of bike for your buck.
Nothing wrong with buying a bike in the winter.
Don' t let that...
- Eeh... nothing with fewer gears?
- C' mon, don' t be cheap with yourself.
People around here can be a bit narrow minded.
I' ve always driven Yank cars.
I love the purr of an old V8, the smooth ride.
Folks get pretty bent out of shape over those wheels.
But you can' t let it get to you.
Come spring thaw, out for a drive!
- 5, 200, huh?
Listen, I' d like to show you something you could really help me out with.
Now this is very dear to me.
- that meets every Thursday in the congregation hall.
We do a spring concert and you' re just the man to come and...
- No, no, I' m too impatient.
- Just to brush us up a little.
Offer some good advice.
You aren' t cheap in that way?
- 4, 600.
- I just came here to listen...
Great!
Come on Thursda y, to listen.
Just to listen.
4, 200 and a sweatsuit thrown in.
See you on Thursday.
The Lord is coming Hills, sink!
- But I' m the one who runs this choir!
- Siv, he' s only coming to listen.
- What' s his name?
- Daniel Daréus.
Typical Arne, giving out orders.
I' m in charge of the choir.
We' re rehearsing any wa y.
You' re only in charge, Siv because we don' t have a cantor.
- Does Stig know about this?
- The Pastor has nothing to do with it!
- It' s all Arne' s delusions of grandeur!
- What' s the problem?
- Musicians aren' t cheap in that way...
- Arne, simmer down.
Well, if he' s coming, of course we should sing!
I' m not going to sing, neither is Olga.
Olga' s old enough to make her own decisions.
Siv, come on.
You need a fella.
Ma ybe he' s something for you.
As far as I know, he' s single.
Oh, stop it!
No, don' t worry.
I' il be there when you get home.
Yes, dinner' s ready.
But you said I could go.
I' il be home when you get there.
Welcome.
I' m Gabriella.
I was passing by and heard singing.
Much of it is very nice.
- We are not pros.
- But we could be much better.
- Well, within our limitations.
- I dreamt he would come.
I just wanted...
I was passing by and...
Thank you so much.
- He said "much of it is very nice".
- Did he say "much of it"?
- Those very words?
- Yes!
"Much of it is very nice."
Did you hear that, Olga?
"Much of it is very nice", he said.
Hello!
It' s me, Lena...
The Bingo lottery ticket.
Carry on.
I' il be right there.
But your ticket didn' t win.
I' ve checked.
This is my boyfriend.
- Hi.
- Hello.
You' ve got to listen to it.
Bye.
You need warmer clothes, Daniel.
No you fucking don' t.
You' re not going anywhere!
Fucking slut!
Stop it, stop it!
For God' s sake, stop it!
Well, if it isn' t the little artist.
Get your hands off her!
Your kind don' t belong here!
- I' m warning you!
- No, Conny!
Let go!
Mind your own business!
It' s him.
- that I have sinned in thought, word and deed.
I have not loved Thee above all else nor my neighbour as myself.
- and contribute to the world' s negligence of Thee.
I beseech Thee, help me cease my sins.
Forgive me, in the name of Jesus Christ.
Amen.
This is a surprise.
A simple position as cantor.
Is it worth it?
Music is all I know.
But the church is cold and the salary meagre.
The pay is dreadful.
Take my advice, don' t do it.
- My mind' s made up.
How nice.
Welcome!
This is my wife, Inger.
It' s up to the church council, so it' il take a while.
I' d like to begin immediately.
Do you realize the job entails running the choir?
But they can' t possibly meet your demands.
Everything begins with listening.
- When do you finish?
- I' il call you later.
Imagine that all music already exists.
It' s up here, all around, vibrating, ready to be taken down.
It' s all a matter of listening, of being ready to take it down.
You understand?
- Yes.
Each person has their own unique tone, their own individual tone.
Arne here.
Yes.
Don' t you want that with a built- in DVD, yeah...
It' s got PAL, NTSC and...
No, no!
Just human voices.
Yes.
Some advice, please, on what to do.
How should I begin?
Right...
Balance.
Balance...
Yes, exactly.
The torso.
Right.
We know where our stomachs are.
Let' s massage them to wake them up.
And pat them...... and massage them.
And twist, backwards, then forwards.
Good.
Your fingers...
Then shake them out.
Excellent!
Listen, and give it back.
Let' s hope no one walks in on us.
Is the door locked?
Each person has his own individual tone.
Try and find yours.
Begin, slowly... to sound...
Find the harmony.
I started to think of the Pastor.
Music is about listening.
You' re so eager, Arne!
The singing will come, later.
He' s worked with the great vocalists.
And we have fun, too.
I haven' t felt so happy in a very long time!
Of course you must come, you must.
See you on Thursday as usual.
- Don' t you sing?
Later, sa ys Daniel.
- Why must you defend him?
- I' m not defending him.
I enjoy doing something new.
It' s good he takes things gently.
- Don' t deny you were defending him.
- He' s trying to get to know us.
All hold hands.
The core.
Either you participate, or you leave, please.
- I' m just here to listen.
- lf you sit here it affects me.
I' m doing something here that' s entirely new to me.
- And what, may I ask, are you doing?
- New faces, new sounds...
Oka y, Maestro.
There' s a great difference between people here and in the big wide world.
One must observe certain limits.
As cantor many eyes are upon you.
- What a grump!
- I' m glad it' s just us now.
Where were we?
Arms out.
We are going to the source...
Excuse me.
Hello?
Hi there!
No, I don' t do renovations.
Is it a Cadillac?
He' s really good.
He sold one for 700, 000 to a Norwegian last week.
Oka y?
Bye.
Yep... we were going to the source, right?
- Coffee break.
Come along.
- Coffee?
Now?
About who we are!
All music comes from within!
Concentration!
Without concentration, nothing can emerge!
Here.
Have some water.
Daniel, you know... this is all so new to us.
We aren' t used to...
Coffee' s important, too.
I knew it.
Hell, I knew it.
Here we go!
Gabriella...
Lena.
Amanda.
Arne.
- In on one, see?
- Now find your unique voice...... vibrating inside you.
Find your tone.
I' il take care of this.
Tore...
Arne, take it easy.
It' s only Tore.
- Give him a cookie.
- Tore, we' re not locking up yet.
- Sit over here, Tore.
I wan... join in.
- Tore, be a good boy now.
- Here' s a bun, with sugar on top.
- He sa ys he wants to join.
- Well, you see, he can' t read or write.
- He' s cuckoo.
- I want to join!
It' il just cause problems.
We must have some criterion.
I think Tore should join us.
Isn' t he your cousin, Arne?
I' ve got plans for this choir!
Don' t you see?
I' m working very hard for us!
At the spring concert, is Tore to be up there -
- next to fatso Holmfrid?
- Smoking outside, Arne.
- Oh for God' s sake!
All this newfangled...
Arne, wait!
Arne is so dedicated.
Great!
An A. Erik.
Gabriella.
Now we' ve got two basses!
It pisses me off!
"Isn' t he your cousin" and "smoking outside".
Calm down Arne.
Are we running some kind of kindergarten?
Hang on!
Could I come an hour earlier next time?
I' d like you to help me.
So I can find my tone.
- Just you and I?
- Yes.
I' ve got to run.
See you!
Bye- bye!
Stig, I' ve been wondering about your voice.
Why do you sound so ceremonious doing weddings?
'Will you take this...?'
- Marriage involves a major decision.
- But it can make people nervous.
"Will you take..." People might get second thoughts, Stig.
You do use different voices in church.
At funerals, a different one.
- 'Dust to dust; ashes to ashes.'
- Are you making fun of me?
- Stig, will you take this woman?
- That' il do now.
I' m being serious, Stig.
Will you take this woman?
Can I see your shoes?
You' il have to change shoes, or get them reheeled, for the right balance.
Straighten your back.
Walk up and down a bit, and sing.
Take off your sweater.
I know it' s there.
It just needs to be set free.
Open your throat, open your chest.
Release your sound.
I want to...
- Is there something stopping you?
- It scares me.
It' s all so much, I' m not sure I dare.
I' d like to tell you about something.
Once, during a concert there was a power failure.
But the musicians continued to play.
They couldn' t see their music, nor me.
I leave it all up to the orchestra.
No one sees me.
That' s when I experienced it for the first time.
All minds were joined.
58 seconds...
That' s a pretty long time.
Prague '82.
I was 19.
- So you mean that...?
- It' s all there.
This is the great secret.
That' s when we can take down the music.
I ask myself, what is he after?
Something' s happening to people there.
We haven' t rehearsed anything, not once.
- Not even for the services?
- Nothing at all.
He' s up to something.
What do you mean, Siv?
It feels like he' s using us for his own purposes.
I' d like you to keep attending, please.
Listen everybody, listen!
Daniel has said yes!
He can judge if we' re ready.
'Are we really going to charge?' someone asked.
Of course we are!
The village hall costs, all venues cost.
So a concert should cost.
I thought: tickets, 100 crowns each.
It increases the product value.
Six weeks to go, to the concert.
The only valid excuse for absence is your own funeral.
I' m finished.
Now let' s rehearse.
'Glorious is all on earth.'
Glorious is all on earth
You came here even though...
I told you to stay at home!
Don' t think I don' t know!
Wait, wait...
Careful now, for Christ' s sake!
- He' s drunk.
That' s why he comes.
- He' s dragged her away a few times.
But he beats her!
And everyone knows it.
It' s like talking to a wall.
- Why doesn' t she leave him?
- He could do anything to her.
She doesn' t dare, she' s terrified.
Look at Tore there.
Now we' re in the shit.
- What did I tell you!
- Shut up, Arne.
- God damn it Siv!
Are you starting?!
Haven' t you ever shit your pants?
I' m beginning to wonder!
Come along, Tore.
Say my name, Lena.
- Tore.
- Say the other thing, too.
- What is it you want me to say?
- The three words.
- The three words?
- Yes, sa y the three words.
I love you, Tore.
- Hello!
- Hello.
What are you doing?
Nothing special.
Going for a bike ride?
Yup...
Shall we ride together?
Lena, I don' t know how.
You can' t learn to ride a bike on your own.
Someone' s got to hold on.
Don' t pedal yet, I' il push.
Just try and keep your balance.
- This is interesting.
- Interesting?
You' re the one always talking about balance.
Climb on.
- Now, hold on.
- Are you holding on?
- Yes.
- You' re holding on?
- Yes!
Eyes ahead...
Don' t look back!
You weren' t holding on!
You weren' t holding on.
Six metres, Daniel.
Not bad for first time.
There' s no harmony.
Is there anyone here who needs to get something off their chest?
- I' ve something I' d like to bring up.
- Oh for God' s sake.
- But we' re going to have a party.
I' ve alwa ys thought that Lena has a way, that' s not good for this choir.
- And it concerns all of us.
- Lena?!
- "A wa y that' s not good for the choir?"
- Arne, Daniel' s asked us to be open.
So I really want to be honest.
Don' t we have a responsibility to each other here in the choir?
Lena and I sing the same part, and we' re to harmonize, aren' t we?
Are we to just stand by and ignore the kind of life she leads?
Why doesn' t anyone ever object?
- Damn it!
Pull yourself together, Siv!
It' s not the Christian faith to party on Saturday night...... and then...
You know what I mean...
Then to stand in church and sing on Sunday morning.
Seeing Lena hop in and out of all these different cars.
In and out of different cars?
You know as well as I do.
The young girls might think it has something to do with love.
That that' s the way for a woman to behave.
- There, I' ve said what I have to sa y.
- Right.
Admit it, Siv you' re just jealous of Lena.
You ought to be ashamed, laughing at someone who dares be honest!
Try being honest yourself!
Tore' s pacing.
Where' s the corkscrew?
I' il go out and get Siv.
FLORENCE, FLORENCE, FLORENCE!
This one' s for you, Arne!
Sin in the congregation hall, Stig.
Go- go girls - like Sodom and Gomorrah.
- I know it all!
- You know it all?
- Nothing' s happened.
You expose your breasts in the congregation hall and this is nothing?
I was a bit tipsy, dancing...
- Sin has descended...
- Stop it!
Inger, you have sinned!
On church premises!
Now I' m going to sa y something I' ve wanted to say for a long time.
Something that' s plagued me for 20 years.
There is no sin.
All this damn talk about sin!
It only exists in your head.
- What!
- There is no sin.
"There is no sin?"
Think of what you' re sa ying!
I have thought.
The church invented sin.
Handing out guilt with one hand then offering redemption with the other.
It' s all a lie, hot air, to suppress people, to gain power.
Silence!
Ask for God' s forgiveness!
God doesn' t forgive, don' t you get that!
Because he' s never condemned.
- Silence!
- Try to be humble, Stig.
I am humble!
You think I didn' t know about it?
For years I' ve known you' ve had your pictures here.
You' ve come out here before we' ve made love...
Black stockings, high boots, bottoms...
To get stimulated.
It' s all right, Stig.
But don' t condemn others.
Inger, God hears you.
He hears and he smiles, you can bet on it.
The church has made a sin of sexuality.
God hasn' t.
You' ve had a need, you haven' t hurt anyone by it.
There have been a few times in bed we' ve enjoyed...
Stop it...
Stig.
I love you.
I alwa ys have.
I' ve kept everything inside.
But not any more.
I' ve kept my mouth shut, repressed everything I' ve felt...... and seen, and heard and thought.
Come...
Come, Stig...
Jesus Christ, forgive me my sins...
Inger, what happened last night between us...
It never happened.
- What?
- It never happened...
I repeat: what happened between us last night never happened.
We' ve got three new members in the choir toda y, young people.
How nice.
Very good!
That' s how it should sound!
- Right?
One more thing, some good news: ticket sales are going well.
We' re getting a bit famous, see?
We should be sold out!
- Let' s add to our repertoire.
- A new song?
- Yes, brand new!
- Exciting.
- In time for the concert?
This song is for you.
It' s your song, Gabriella.
At the concert, I want you to sing this.
The solo is yours.
I can' t.
Never.
We have time before mass.
But why me?
When you sa y, "I can' t" I find it hard to believe.
I' ve composed it for you.
I' ve listened to you, Gabriella.
Could I ask you something?
Why are you here, when you could...
To create music that opens people' s hearts.
It' s still my dream.
- That' s no small dream.
I found it hard to love people.
- Don' t think I don' t like you.
- That' s not what I think.
You' re strange.
Everyone here' s in love with you.
You must have noticed.
Inger, she' s crazy about you and...
Lena loves you and...
I record everything you sa y.
Then I sit at home in the garage and listen to you.
Conny says he' s going to shoot you.
Take care.
Heavens, you do go on!
I' m exhausted.
Hold on tight, here.
- What are you up to?
- How do you mean?
Many in the congregation are very concerned.
How nice with a fiddler!
I' m not stupid, you know!
I can understand how the ladies in the choir could take a fancy to you.
What are you talking about?
A cantor must never manipulate parishioners.
A cantor must not exploit his office for the purpose of intimate relations.
I trust I' ve made myself clear.
Confront me when you have one single example of misconduct.
Not too fast.
You know where the brakes are, don' t you?
Good balance!
Let' s try a turn, and no ditch like the last time.
Fantastic!
Daniel can ride a bike!
This is fun, it is!
Now we' ve known each other for 145 da ys.
- Are you counting the da ys?
- Now everyone knows.
That I like you.
- I' m not doing it.
- Show Conny that you can do it.
Wait now, Arne.
She' s not doing it for Conny.
- Show him what she' s made of.
Please wait.
- I' m not doing it.
- We' re sold out... every ticket!
Now we can show them what we' re worth.
How can you know what' s best for Gabriella?
She could at least make an effort.
But of course she' s afraid of how Conny will react.
Look at Holmfrid!
Fatso' s at it, sucking up.
Christ all- mighty!
You damned bastard... what have you done, you!
I' ve had enough of you!
Fatso this, Fatso that!
You bastard!
You cowardly bastards!
You' ve laughed along...
For 35 years he' s been at it.
Every day at school...
School was one long hell.
You were alwa ys at it, Arne.
"Fatty- Fatso Sausage- boy."
You never quit, Arne...
All those years at school.
"Fatty- Fatso Holmfrid."
It is now that my life is mine
I' ve got this short time on earth and my longing has brought me here all I lacked and all I gained
And yet it' s the wa y that I chose
My trust was far beyond words
That has shown me a little bit
Of the heaven I' ve never found
All my living da ys
I will live as I desire
I want to feel I' m alive
Knowing I was good enough
I have never lost who I was
I have only left it sleeping
Ma ybe I never had a choice
Just the will to sta y alive
All I want is to be happy
Being who I am
To be strong and to be free
To see da y arise from night
And my life is only mine
And the heaven I thought was there
I' il discover it there somewhere
That I' ve lived my life
Ten new applicants to the choir!
Darling gorgeous Gabriella can' t you be my Cinderella?
I feel so proud.
It' s great when people recognise you.
Two people came up to me and said I was good.
It makes your eyes water.
I' d like to sa y.
And it' s about you, Florence.
What I want to say, I' ve never said to anyone before.
- that, ever since we were at elementary school, I have loved you.
I saw the looks you gave him.
- It' s not true, Conny.
Eh?
You lie.
Why didn' t you come straight home?
I said okay to the concert.
Why didn' t you come straight home?!
- You fucking slut!
- Please, Conny, just let me be...
- There you are.
- How lovely!
Coffee break!
Hello, hello, hello!
Your attention, please!
- What are you up to now, Arne?
- Here it is in black and white.
It came in today' s mail.
German, but I' il translate:
"Ljusåker Church Choir has been registered to compete" -
- "in the Let the People Sing choir contest" -
- "which is to take place in the native country of Mozart and music."
We compete, on stage, 28 July at 11 a. m.
Yes.
We' il all be going there.
I' ve never been abroad before!
You don' t know what you' re getting yourselves into.
What is it?
Does it scare you?
I' m not scared!
You can' t compete in singing.
- I agree with Daniel.
- But... it' il be fun and exciting.
- We' re ready for this now.
Quiet!
Daniel' s trying to sa y something!
- He' s already had his sa y.
- You' ve no idea...
You can' t compete in music.
The idea' s insane!
It' s against all my beliefs!
You have no idea.
I' ve done it!
It' s not good for you.
I agree entirely.
I just thought that...
Daniel, how do you know it' s not good for us to go to Austria?
Yes, how can you tell, Daniel?
Okay.
- then we will do something truly different...
They' re gonna hear music unlike anything they' ve ever heard before.
That' s it, Daniel!
I just want to say that I' m leaving the choir.
- Leaving?
You can' t leave now, Siv!
- I' ve had enough, Arne.
- I thought this was a church choir.
- You mustn' t... no one' s to leave.
- What' s happened?
I don' t understand.
- You' ve made your choice, a slut.
You won' t be here for long!
Siv, Siv, come back!
Come back!
- Let' s have a swim!
It' s too cold.
Well I' m going for a swim.
First dip of the year.
- Can' t you swim?
- Sure, I can swim.
Daniel...
I want to tell you something.
I was really in love with a man.
My greatest wish was to share my life with him.
He worked as a doctor here.
For two years, we were together.
But he was married, with a wife and children in Stockholm.
He lied to me, all that time.
No one' s ever going to do that again.
It hurt so terribly, see?
What is it?
At the Church Council meeting of 24 June... yesterda y... it was decided -
- that Daniel Daréus be dismissed from his position as cantor.
There have been reports, from several people.
Extremely serious accusations.
- I' m unable to discuss it.
The Council is conducting an enquiry.
Things have transpired which oblige me...
I am taking the choir awa y from you.
Now, please hand in your keys to the church and congregation hall.
We have nothing more to sa y to one other.
- I pity you, Stig.
- You' ve no idea what he' s done.
Rubbish!
You' re such a coward.
Firing him because the choir outnumbers your church- goers!
- My husband... firing Daniel.
- You don' t know what you' re talk...
I know all right!
You fire him because he reminds you of everything that you daren' t show.
It hurts you to see a man who shows you just how small you really are.
You' re not angry at him, but at what he evokes in you.
Look at yourself, for god' s sake, Stig.
Take it back, please!
It' s already been decided by the Church Council.
I pity you, Stig.
Then crucifying Daniel yourself!
Don' t you see?
Dear, dear Stig... take it back!
It' s all over.
Daniel' s accepted and handed in his keys.
No!
He' s accepted...
This circus is over!
- Where' s Inger?
- Not feeling well.
Attention, please.
The Church Council has dismissed Daniel effective immediately.
There will be an investigation.
Serious allegations have been filed.
He has abused his position for personal gain.
He has gone too far...
The investigation will explain all.
What "personal gain"?
Stig, no one here understands what you mean.
- Has anyone here changed their mind?
- No!
- We go on rehearsing?
- Yes!
- Austria' s still on?
- Yes!
Next question: what shall we sing?
- Daniel, what shall we sing?
Is it too much to ask what' s going on?
- How have you abused your position?
- La y off, Lena!
- Keep quiet!
Quiet!
- Come on...
Have you slept with anyone here?
What did Stig mean?
Shut up, Arne!
You know what that means?
If you lie to me, Daniel, then I' il walk straight out that door.
Just so you know.
So answer me.
I want to know.
Have you slept with anyone here?
Answer!
I don' t want to be fooled again.
- Haven' t you gotten over your doctor?
- You' re out of your mind, Arne!
I am over him!
But I' m not over the fact that...... none of you ever said anything!
Why didn' t anyone tell me?
You all knew.
You knew, Arne.
That he was married... had a family, children.
You were in on it, and said nothing!
Why didn' t you say anything?
The hell with all of it!
Go to Austria without me.
Daniel...
- Go after her!
Hurry!
Lena, wait!
Get your hands off me!
I got the message!
Christ, how stupid I' ve been!
I fell for it again.
You' re here for a while, then you move on...
- I knew it!
- Lena, can I ask you one thing?
How do you know that you' re sure?
- What do you mean?
- lf you don' t like someone...
What are you talking about?
Who is it you don' t like?
- Is it me?
No!
It was just an example.
Why don' t you turn it round...
"If you like someone, how can you be really sure?"
You feel happy when you see her.
- Correct!
- You think about her.
Bingo!
You' re driving me crazy!
How old are you?
- You look like a lost lumberjack.
- Lena...
I haven' t slept with anyone here, or tricked anyone, not you, not anyone!
Shall we go inside?
You are strange...
Let' s give it a try.
Answer me, Inger.
Answer!
Wake up!
What are you looking at?
Come back to me.
- Hello!
- Hello!
- Hi!
- Hiya!
I was just passing.
I thought you' d need a map, now that you' re biking so far.
To find my wa y home?
My grandpa painted the angels.
- Really?
- He' s fantastic, my grandpa.
When I was about to start school, he just had to paint in an extra angel.
Down in the corner.
I often see them.
Sometimes I just hear the wind...
Do you believe in angels?
If I squint I sometimes see their wings.
I saw wings on Olga and on Arne, in the last song.
I' ve seen them on Tore.
I' ve seen them on you.
You' re ready when you see them on everyone.
You can if you practise.
Lena...
I' ve known the whole time.
- Known what?
- That you' re scared.
You needn' t be scared, Daniel.
There is no death.
Ever since my parents died when I was small, I' ve known.
There is no death.
I can see them on you, Daniel.
It' s the first time I' ve made a bed for someone else.
I just need to be on my own.
Mass is cancelled.
Wait here, my sweethearts.
I' ve left Conny.
I don' t know where we can go.
- You can sta y with us.
- We' ve got lots of room.
I' il be damned!
She' s not supposed to be here!
I' m taking her home now.
You' re going to regret this.
Let' s keep our departure time secret, so nothing happens.
Bus, as we planned.
It looks as though we' il all fit into one bus.
Gabriella will have her children with her.
Any questions?
How old can a bird get?
I' il pick you up personally, Tore.
It' s for you, Daniel.
Stop there.
Sit down.
You can' t imagine that a pastor could sit here, wanting to kill?
Two cartridges... one for you and one for me.
I was somebody, here.
People looked up to me.
You' ve taken everything away from me.
Everything!
I can' t show my face around here now!
Where' s Inger gone to?
Where is she?
Why did you come here?
Why come here!
You' ve been screwing her, you bastard!
Who the fuck do you think you are!
We were at school together, Conny.
It' s me, Daniel with the fiddle...
Water, water... - Daniel!
Oh, my God!
We two...... won' t be living together any more.
Make use of your time here.
Ask for help so you can see our children again some da y.
I don' t wish you ill, Conny.
I know you' ve done your best.
We all do that.
Mamma took me awa y from here.
That' s what happened.
- I' ve never felt like this before.
Welcome back home.
Hello, Tore!
And you... jump up.
I' ve packed the things you asked for.
I also packed your favourite walking shoes.
Thank you.
That was thoughtful of you.
All aboard - we need to be off.
- I' ve got to go now.
- Inger...
Do you think we could...?
I don' t know, Stig.
Lena!
It' s me, Daniel.
I don' t want to talk to you right now.
There' s something you told me that I have to say to you.
It' s really important.
I' ve have to say it right now.
When you like someone...
You' re happy when you see them.
What else?
You think about him.
When you love someone you feel happy, being with him.
You feel happy, being... with her.
Lena, I can say it now.
Say it then.
I love you.
Now we' ve known each other for...
Now we' ve known each other for... 184 days.
You know what, Daniel...?
A happy thing...
I think grandpa must go to school and paint in another little angel.
This way, everybody.
Holmfrid, up in the corner.
Where' s your conductor?
He' s on his way.
It' s Daniel Daréus.
Stay put.
Sta y put.
He' il be here.
Come on, use your jab!
Box the damn guy, come on!
Get out of that corner!
That' s it, that' s my little brother!
Jab!
Jab!
Come on, Uncle Ray.
Come on.
Come on.
- Left hook.
- Once is not enough.
Come on, again.
- Jab, jab.
That' s it.
You see what happens when you listen to me?
- Thanks.
Hey, you do not belong up here, all right?
I' m not gonna tell you again.
Go wash your hands and make yourself invisible.
She wants to help out.
She' s a midget with a head full of stupid.
Who' s she gonna help, huh?
- Yeah.
On the way, Mr. K.
Come on!
Hey, do you know who you are out of all the girls in the world?
I' m your favorite?
And what' s she gonna do when she grows up?
- That' s right.
The world' s an oyster and you' re a pearl.
Pearls are pretty, and they' re tough.
And pretty tough can do anything.
Remember that.
OK, Uncle Ray.
Hey, Mr. Abel.
- Hey, how are you, sir?
- Good morning, Mr. Abel.
- Yeah, beautiful.
Coffee.
Coffee.
It was not a question the first time I asked for it.
You told me last week, "absolutely, positively no coffee", and I absolutely, positively believed you.
The Telegram bled our ad.
It' s nothing major, but we should get credit for the next fight.
Memo from finance:
I ran some numbers...
- Did you take care of my bookie?
- I stalled him and your ex- wife.
I also printed out your e- mail, restocked your bar, hosed down Mel Harris.
Top drawer, left side, all you have to do is sign off on them.
You see, that' s why I' m the boss, Kallen.
Because I let you handle things for me.
I would send myself roses.
Well, roses die and you might be allergic, but thanks for thinking of you.
LaRocca' s event briefing, where do you want that?
In the conference room.
It' s my handiwork.
Put it someplace Sammy can see.
I hate it.
I hate it a lot.
Are these guys gonna fight or foxtrot?
They look like Homo sapiens or something.
They are Homo sapiens,
Kallen speaks.
And from a mile away.
- No, it' s not a hygienic thing.
She just gets kind of shy around you.
I' m sorry you' re unhappy with the standee, but we only went with the shot because your guys approved it.
If I say the shit' s shit, it' s shit.
I mean, they told me that you signed off on it, Sammy.
I don' t know what the hell happened.
Jackie, what happened?
I don' t care what happened.
You have 48 hours before the fight.
I want the two faggots fixed.
I mean, who the hell does Sam LaRocca think he is?
- A made man, that' s who.
He is...
With a bank account.
He is this.
An $80 shoe?
He is the gum on the bottom of my shoe.
That' s what Abel and LaRocca are.
How come they walk all over you?
Get a little older, work a little longer, you won' t be so judgmental then.
You think I like working for idiots who take advantage of me?
That' s easy for you to say.
This is not the best job you ever had.
At least here I get to see boxing, in person, for free.
Boxing makes all the other shit bearable.
If I didn' t love it as much as I do,
I' d be the first in line to bend over so LaRocca and Abel could kiss my ass.
OK, don' t get upset with me just because you know that I know how smart you are.
That your brain can just plot the best course and your life just goes there?
The world is not an oyster.
It is a smelly tank full of dirty water and sharks.
It is not that easy to swim.
Jackie, you need to get real about where you are, which is stuck.
You can' t even see the glass ceiling from here.
Find an elevator, press some buttons.
At least the only way out is up.
Clean towels, we need more clean towels.
Bad break, Rex.
I won that fight.
Everybody saw it.
You would' ve won if you hadn' t run out of gas.
You train serious, you could have a career.
You deserved a draw.
If day- old shit shook like an AK- 47.
Shut up!
You can' t say dick that wouldn' t piss me off more.
Mr. LaRocca, it' s adrenaline.
Ask my last 12 wins.
- Hey, Jackie.
- Hey, Devon.
I' m only interested in the 13th.
Lose tonight and you' il be waving bye- bye to your career, your fan club and the free hoochie mamas that go with it.
What are you selling?
Sorry to interrupt, but it' s showtime.
Let' s get out of here.
Come on, you can do this.
Get your hands up, you bum!
He' s got no left hand.
What' s the story with Greene?
Get off the ropes!
That' s it.
- Yeah.
No more, no more.
That' s a kaput.
It' s like he didn' t bother to show up.
Trust me, he' s dead.
And if I know Sammy, he already wrote the obituary.
- See you, Gavin.
Yeah.
Jacqueline.
I' d offer a seat, but I don' t think anyone would get up.
- Thirsty?
- Let me buy you a drink.
Bowie, hi.
- All right.
- Like that dress.
- The cleaner' s shrunk it.
- I' il send a thank- you note.
They' re good.
He' s exactly what your advertisers want.
- Do we have to do this now?
- Do what, talk?
You' re negotiating.
Stop it.
Listen, if I was a man trying to close a deal, you wouldn' t say that.
Oh, please.
- Unless you mean it.
I can' t have a regular conversation with you.
Oh, right.
You' re Mr. Irresistible.
I wish.
Kallen!
Come here!
I gotta go.
There it is.
For the pride of Puerto Rico.
- Here we go.
J. Lo' s coming to the Coliseum next month.
I want me and Pedro front and center.
Consider it done.
- Hey, shouldn' t you have that on ice?
- What are you, a doctor?
No, the doctors are busy stitching up Greene.
Screw him.
He' s out of the picture.
Pedro, I' m a man who hates defeat, but I' m not too proud to be candid.
You won because you worked and Greene didn' t.
He' s a lazy- ass fighter, and lazy- ass always loses.
That' s a fact.
Right, half- pint?
Well, I' m...
I' m not sure why Devon lost.
Maybe he just felt insecure about his corner.
You know, boxing is a team sport.
If a boxer doesn' t feel support in his corner, sometimes it comes out in the ring.
Listen to the Barbie doll with the glass balls.
What do you know about support?
What do you know about boxing?
Executive assistant.
You wipe lrv Abel' s ass for a living.
I cover lrv Abel' s ass for a living.
And I know as much about boxing as either of you.
What' s that mean?
- Nothing.
- Forget it?
You talk like you think you can do what I do.
I don' t have a boxer.
Do you think you can do what I do?
- Possibly, if given a chance.
- Yeah, probably.
- Greene' s contract.
- Sure it is.
- Hey!
- I can' t afford it.
I' il make it easy.
- It' s yours for a dollar.
- I don' t have a dollar.
I' il lend you a dollar.
I' m gonna forget what you said since you don' t know what you' re talking about.
Because if you did, you' d know it don' t pay to shoot your mouth off at me.
I just bought a boxer for a buck.
I think it pays pretty well, Sam.
I' m not keeping Greene.
It was a thing that became a thing.
LaRocca insulted me.
Sammy insults everybody.
You' re gonna call him, make up, kiss his ass if you have to.
If anybody asks about Greene, it was a joke, a little parlor trick that you and Sammy played.
You lost your temper, you said a few ridiculous things.
It' il blow over.
Sammy won' t think you' re trying to grow a brain on me.
It wasn' t ridiculous, what I said.
And you shouldn' t be drinking that coffee.
Welcome back to the live weekend edition of the Reese Report,
Fight fan or feminist, you' re going to love this story,
After watching Devon Greene crawl off the canvas, fight promoter Sam LaRocca managed to lose his boxer and his ego in a round of verbal sparring with Coliseum employee Jackie Kallen,
LaRocca thought he had Kallen in the corner, but she outmaneuvered him and wound up walking away with Greene' s contract,
The price tag?
A dollar,
That' s platinum stuff,
It was priceless, and I enjoyed it for free,
Renee, it' s me.
Turn on Channel 28.
I' m on TV!
Hey, Sam, do you know what a coup d' etat is?
I' m Gavin Reese for the Reese Report, See you next week,
Girl, what the hell happened to all his money?
I didn' t have a chance to ask.
His phone' s disconnected, so I had to come.
I got here, I was fine, and then I wasn' t fine.
So you called me for blackup.
Like I need Gangster lncorporated in my life.
Like LaRocca is gonna let you waltz off with his boxer.
Like any of this makes any sense.
I' m more scared not to do this than to do it.
Devon is a ranked boxer.
God practically dropped him in my lap.
I might as well spit in the face of destiny.
Now he' s your destiny?
Devon, are you in there?
It' s Jackie Kallen.
We failed.
Let' s go.
Wait, wait, I hear something.
He' s unlocking the door.
Devon, did you know your phone' s not work...?
You know Stormy.
Get the shit.
We don' t have any shit.
- Why?
We just...
And you' re busy, so we' il come back.
You bitches ain' t going nowhere till we get our rock!
Give my man your bag!
- That' s all I have with me...
A chump?
You can just smoke T. J. 's shit like it' s a gift?
Man, come here!
Man, you done messed up my high.
Come on, Jackie, let' s go!
Let' s go!
- I' m sorry.
- I don' t forgive you.
"Where' s my rock, bitches?"
What about that guy, the way he waxed the floor with both their asses?
He was a thug who out- thugged another thug.
A thug- and- a- half if you count your boy Devon, who is pathetic, Jackie!
You still overpaid!
- I' m sorry.
You better be.
I' m going to see my cousin Malik.
I don' t know why you mess with me, all these criminals out here, man.
Oh, hey, Luther Shaw.
Jackie Kallen.
I bailed you out.
Not exactly.
Listen.
- How about a milk shake?
Yeah.
Yeah, whatever you drink.
Listen, I know this is unusual.
That would make me a nut, a broke nut.
And I' m not.
I' m not nutty.
I' m just a person taking a chance.
You might be interested in who I am and what I have to say.
If you' re not, I totally understand.
You don' t owe me a thing.
If, on the other hand, you are, my car' s parked around the corner.
Really.
Really, the worst I could give you is a ride.
It was brutal, you know, it was beautiful the way you fought.
I can tell you fought before.
You had some training, you won some amateur bouts.
- You were good...
- Do you always talk like this?
- Like what?
- Too much?
- Actually, people have said...
Know what, pull over right here.
Pull over right here.
- OK, Luther.
This shit you' re talking is crazy.
Hanging with crackhead Devon.
I came to see...
Look, I didn' t know he was doing crack, OK?
Another black man bites the dust.
Thanks for the bail, bitch.
- What' s up?
My name is Jackie!
What' s happening?
Now, Luth, we ain' t saying that you ain' t bad.
We know that, but don' t be selling us some bullshit, because you know you ain' t mopped the floor with no Devon Greene.
I' m telling you, man, I gave that fool an old- fashioned, project ass- whupping.
I had to dust his ass off too.
- You still here?
- Yeah.
- Go home.
- I can' t.
You didn' t let me finish.
All right, way out there.
But that is where all the good stuff is, Luther.
Like talent, and you...... you' re talented.
So this chance you call yourself taking, why you taking it on me?
Because I' ve been around boxing my whole life.
I know it like the back of my hand.
I know potential, and I see it in you.
I do, Luther.
- Yeah.
- Watch out, world.
- Don' t laugh at me.
I' m serious.
If you took me serious, we could be driving Jags and sporting Versace.
And you' re white.
- In the fight game, you are.
- In the fight game, you are.
But I' m used to hard.
OK?
Do you want to work together?
You want to make a deal?
- Yeah.
You never managed nobody in your whole life.
How you gonna front me, you can' t front yourself?
You' re driving a damn Honda.
I have some savings, I' il do a budget.
I' m good with budgets.
I can read them.
And I can read you, Luther, and I know you want to do this.
Maybe I' m interested.
Maybe I won' t.
You' re the one that' s gonna have to wait and see.
When you pay your tickets, you can register your vehicle.
Basically, it' s what you call an "all there is to it" situation.
Mister, when you pay your tickets, you can register...
- Next!
Jackie Kallen.
We spoke on the phone.
I remembered you, you didn' t remember me.
Hey, Cynthia, I' m breaking.
So you say this boy is good, huh?
Well, good is a dime a dozen.
Oh, no, he' s better than good.
And you' re the best.
You' ve turned more chumps into champs than Eddie Futch.
I got out of the game for a reason, you know.
I was sorry to hear about that.
The stroke didn' t do nothing but clear my head.
Look, I ain' t got time to waste training no cash registers in it for the money.
That' s a wonderful sentiment, and I totally agree.
It' s a sport first.
You know, learn your craft, pay your dues.
Money will come, and it will go.
That' s why they call it "cash flow".
Felix, this kid reminds me of Marvin Hagler.
It' s just nonstop punches.
He is the real deal.
I wouldn' t have troubled you otherwise.
Ray- Ray Kallen' s niece.
All right.
I' il take a meet.
Felix.
Luther may just...
He may be just a... tiny bit raw.
Well, raw' s workable.
Rotten isn' t.
Look, Felix, I don' t know what to tell you.
- Hey, Felix, it' s traffic, it' s rush hour.
This time every day.
Hey, Luther!
There he is.
Felix Reynolds.
This tired- ass old man is gonna be my trainer.
Lady, I thought you said you had a plan.
Let me see your stance.
He ain' t worth it.
Next.
- Next?
You stop being a brat and apologize.
What' s that supposed to mean?
Hey, Felix!
Now, Luther has something to say to you.
- Luther.
Look, old man, hold up.
No disrespect intended, but what have you done?
Who have you trained?
Let' s hear some actual ring experience.
You first.
Was I right or what?
Yeah, he packs a helluva punch like you said.
They' re all over.
But he' s strong, got a great feint, and he' s a southpaw like Hagler.
He could make some noise in the middleweight division.
Time, boys.
Well, if he can learn to be a switch hitter, fight from the right- hand stance as well as the left,
- he could surprise some people.
- Left, right, whatever.
- It was all right?
- It was better than all right.
But you gotta get in shape, you gotta get in boxing shape, right?
Your mind...... gonna need a whole lot of discipline.
Ain' t nothing wrong with my mind.
Get it at 5: 00.
Oh, no, I don' t get off of work till 6.
In the morning.
Is it cheaper?
It' s available.
Five o' clock in the morning?
Man, you can forget that.
You gotta leave some room for sleep.
Haven' t you slept enough, son?
In three years, I pay you 2...
Luther?
Listen.
Three years, 250 a week, then I recoup that amount from your winnings.
After that, after we start making a profit, you take the lion' s share, I get 33 and a third.
What you think, Felix?
She' s assuming all the risks.
She' s making an investment in you.
Well, she ain' t got to worry.
I' m gonna squash whatever you send my way.
A grand for all that gold?
It' s worth three times more than that.
What about fair?
Does fair work?
No?
OK.
OK, what about this?
1, 250.
Please don' t screw me beyond that point.
I have kids.
How are you doing?
How you been?
Hey, Luth, look here.
This here is Kevin Keyes, the best cutman in the business.
- How you doing?
This is Cedric Mouketendi, your sparring partner.
- Mouke what?
- Mouketendi.
It' s Ugandan.
It' s easier.
I' m gonna take you out, Africa.
Monkey' s ass always talks shit.
Off the ropes!
Come on, spin out of there, now!
Time.
Now you see what the hell I' m telling you about your jab?
Stop street fighting.
When he misses, counterpunch him.
- His rhythm' s great.
- It ain' t his rhythm I' m worried about.
I put him in with a bigger man so he' d learn how to move.
Come on.
Boy, you wanna fight like a damn hoodlum?
I' il toss your black ass back out on the street!
I ain' t playing with you, boy!
Hey, Luther, look at me.
Look, look.
You can' t win if you fight dirty, do you understand that?
- You all right, son?
- Yeah, I' m all right.
- He' s here to help you.
- Sorry, it won' t happen again.
Will it?
- Won' t happen again.
It won' t happen again!
That is not helping him.
Yeah, well, I' m trying to teach the boy how not to use his fists.
What do you suggest?
Handcuffs?
Your uncle Ray- Ray.
He died about a year after that was taken.
Hey, I' il start a scrapbook for you as soon as we get our first fight.
So did your dad start you in boxing?
Counselor, juvenile hall.
In your lap.
And your dad?
May he rest in peace.
And your mom?
Who the hell knows, man?
Do you have any brothers and sisters?
He' s a year older.
Stupid- ass Social Services.
They separated us, so we grew up apart.
It' s no big deal.
I' m being straight with you.
Who were you beating up today in the gym?
It wasn' t Mouketendi.
- I lost my temper.
What you lost is the rest of you.
Look, I go off sometimes, all right?
It' s just how I am.
It' s not a problem.
Yeah?
The problem you don' t have already got in your way, and you haven' t thrown a punch in a pro fight.
I mean, don' t you wanna win, Luther?
I wanna win.
You know, you got all these expectations.
What are you gonna do if this don' t work out?
It' il work out, Luther.
You just have to let yourself trust me.
I am not the enemy.
Hold up, old man, I ain' t into no S & M stuff.
Marvelous Marvin Hagler, Sugar Ray Robinson?
You another young wannabe fighter, come a dime a dozen, trying to look pretty.
I' il tie down your right arm so you can learn to throw a left.
You gotta learn to be balanced on both sides.
Fight somebody that know how to handle a southpaw, better be ready to show him something different.
Let me see it.
- OK, coach.
You know there' s a powder for that.
Six- thirty is open.
I want a 6: 30.
Yeah, and I want a blowjob every hour on the hour.
Is that why you' re acting like such a dick?
All right, dig it in, that' s right, dig it in.
To the body, to the body, to the body.
Combination.
All right, push him off, push him off, push off.
Jump right back on him.
Now, Kallen and this amateur monkey she scraped off the street, Shaw, you said they were nothing.
He' s been training with Reynolds.
He' s been kicking the shit out of some guys in the gym.
Ever.
Make it understood.
Shaw.
Luther Shaw.
S- H- A- W.
No, you can' t call me back.
No, it' s his manager.
Yeah, I' m a woman.
I haven' t thought about strapping one on, mister.
Have you?
Well, I think you have a really nice voice too.
I do.
I don' t need a date.
What I really need is a fight for my boxer.
Jackie Kallen for Crisco Cohen.
Did you hear me?
I' ve known him since we were kids,
Are you listening?
- All right, baby. - to our trio of precious gems,
Ruby, Emerald and Sapphire,
All that plastic.
It' s a wonder she doesn' t melt in that spotlight.
Crisco, it' s me, Jackie Kallen.
What the hell are you doing here?
I got a boxer.
You drove 200 miles to tell me that?
You couldn' t pick up the phone?
Four times.
Hey, I' m a businessman.
Yours ain' t the only number I gotta call.
How' s Judy?
I have never cheated on her.
I just come to these joints for relaxation.
I remember that, Crisco.
How do you think I found you?
- Yeah, well...
Good luck.
100 men ahead of you manage for a living.
- Luther Shaw.
Put him on an undercard.
See what he can do.
We' il never get a fight in the Midwest as long as Sam LaRocca lives and breathes.
Too bad.
I can' t believe you have the nerve to shirk me off.
My father taught you everything you' il ever know.
Pete Kallen is the only reason you are where you are today.
Pete would spin in his grave if he could see what you' re doing.
You' re a secretary, for chrissake.
And you' re a married man addicted to strip joints and God knows what else.
I am sure I could find out.
- What, are you threatening me now?
- No.
I' m thanking you in advance because I know that you' re gonna help me the same way my dad helped you.
Yeah, UUF.
What the hell is that?
- Ulterior Uterine Fibrosis.
- It' s a venereal disease.
It' s a female disease.
It' s still difficult to discuss.
Yeah, privates are tough to talk about.
Most women would' ve made something up.
I' il probably only need a few days sick leave because the procedure I' m having, it' s really just minor surgery.
That' s good.
Where is the operation?
I' il probably just have it in my doctor' s office downtown.
Well, that' s a little out of the way, isn' t it?
Unless you mean downtown Buffalo.
How long am I in this business?
Nothing goes behind my back.
It wouldn' t get back to me?
Well, how can I think?
I don' t have a brain.
You also don' t have a job now unless you stop with this silly extracurricular bullshit.
Now, you will stop, or I' il fire your ass.
And you' il lose your pension, your benefits, everything I let you work for.
Trust me, Kallen, you don' t want this kind of kaput.
I' d rather have that kind of kaput than your kind of stupid.
And remember, use your jab.
- Nervous?
- Why I gotta be nervous?
You' re nervous.
Use the energy, Luther.
You knock him down.
Knock him out.
Oh, gotta get our picture.
And get the three of us in and make this great.
OK, just this once.
Jab.
Jab.
Don' t let him tie you up.
Let him go.
All right, stick that jab out there.
- Got him!
One, two, three, four, five, six.
It' s over!
That was beautiful.
That was beautiful.
Nice work on the jab.
Did you see that?
That was great.
Yeah, he did all right.
One second.
OK?
- Come on in.
Oh, hey, guys, this is Crisco Cohen.
The one that put us on the card.
- Jackie said you weren' t coming.
I' m a promoter.
We don' t read punches in the paper.
- Nice fight.
- Thanks.
Felix Reynolds.
- Sorry, Felix.
- Very nice job tonight.
KO.
Listen, Luther, we got to talk your next fight now.
- Here it is.
Hey, wait a minute.
What are you doing?
You talk to me.
I book.
You need an A- plus story.
I' m handing you one, exclusively.
It' s not algebra, Gavin.
Jackie, you against LaRocca makes a great, quaint anecdote.
Don' t make a mission out of it.
So, what, you' re trying so hard not to say is that it' s a man' s world?
You know it.
God forbid I use anything from the neck up.
He has to climb up the card before I hot- dog him.
- One more fight.
- What' s your rush?
Well, I got fired.
Or maybe I quit.
As if you didn' t know.
The point is, I can' t wait for you to decide if Luther is newsworthy.
Luther Shaw weighs in at...... 159 pounds on the dot.
Here you go.
They get off even thirstier.
- Yeah, he' s stronger.
Your guy looks pretty good too.
Thank you so much.
Don' t drink that.
I' m serious.
I' il get you another one.
Hey there, Mathias.
Hi.
Listen, I saw your last fight, and wow.
That was one beautiful left hook.
Oh, oh, sorry.
Oh, thanks.
I just wanted to say may the best man win.
No hard feelings, no matter what happens.
He don' t like it down there.
Good jab.
Luther, go back to the body.
Get up on him.
You OK, Mathias?
- He don' t wanna fight no more?
- Turn around and box.
Can you continue, Mathias?
- All right.
- It' s over.
That felt good.
- What happened?
- Easy, take it easy, easy.
Get them off!
Oh, kid.
Thanks.
OK, well, that' s my job...... to see shit coming.
Break it up.
Neutral corner.
Come on, grab my hand.
If you grab my hand, I' m going to bring you up the hill.
Come on, keep turning.
- Sounds like things are going great.
Terrific.
It' s over.
No.
Why?
All right, no elevator, but the rooms are huge.
Electric' s included.
The fireplace burns real wood.
It' s called a flue.
Don' t ask me why.
What do you think?
Tell you, the place is tight.
I think I like it.
You know, I hope I can afford it.
It' s all about balancing your checkbook.
Oh, I don' t know.
I don' t even remember what I did with those.
This is the lease agreement for you to look over.
It' s the usual, first and last.
Envelopes, stamps, stationery, all in here.
So how come you don' t have any kids?
It just never came up, the opportunity.
I guess.
I think that you would be dope as a mom.
Oh, thanks.
Yeah.
Listen, Jackie...
Man, this is embarrassing to admit, but, you know, guys like me...
I don' t know nothing about tax forms and lease agreements, insurance or whatever.
Hell, man, I never even voted.
In my former line of business, I dealt with cash.
It' s either cash on the barrel, or I' m gonna hit you with the barrel.
Forget about it.
Luther, you don' t need to be ashamed or embarrassed about anything, OK?
All kinds of people don' t know all kinds of shit.
I can really help you with this stuff.
We could fill those forms out togeth...
What was that for?
For everything.
We' re the new kids on the block, we expect to be picked on, but we don' t run from anybody.
I can' t say the same for some people.
Middleweight World Champion Pedro Hernandez?
Hernandez claims he' s hungry for a worthy opponent.
I mean, what, to him, Luther' s the invisible man?
Oh, but I guess it' s hard to see someone when you' re running away from him, especially if you' re running scared.
Now, Pedro Hernandez won the middleweight crown in devastating fashion against a great ex- champ.
Luther, with only 14 fights, do you think you can beat him?
I can, I could, and I most definitely would.
I' d probably knock him out if he didn' t faint first, Pedro.
Well, there' s only one way to see how this cliffhanger will end.
Stay tuned to Channel 28.
Exclusively.
You' re our local guy.
As for Pedro Hernandez, if you' re watching,

Mr. Maestro, Leonard Bernstein, tape number one.
I have the utmost respect for you.
Your music... is both pure and honest.
And that is why I have chosen you... to present the truth about me to the world.
And I consider myself a grain of sand.
the action that I am about to take... will show the powerful... that even... the least grain of sand... has in him... the power to destroy them.
We do have that in a brown.
And an avocado.
Give me three of the brown and an avocado.
Are you interested in that chair?
I look like that big a slob?
I can' t sit on this plastic stuff.
This doesn' t come in leather, huh?
Not this chair...
- Jack Jones.
- Bill Wilson.
Bill, what our new associate' s trying to explain, I think is... that this is leather with a Naugahyde coating.
Exactly.
Comfort of leather.
How does it feel?
It is comfy.
- You know what you look like sitting there?
- What?
You look like the boss.
Are you the boss?
I got my own place.
What did I tell you?
Did you write the gentleman up, Sam?
No, he didn' t...
Write the gentleman up.
Can we deliver this for you Monday, or is Tuesday better?
<i>Mr.
<i>Alone.
I do.
And you' ve got the odor.
All right, Sam.
Why do I say that to you, Sam?
Well, I certainly am trying.
It' s believing.
You see what I' m saying?
You' ve got to believe.
It' s a gift.
I' ve got it.
You may have it.
I can believe in anything.
Isn' t that right, Marty?
It' s true.
You want to know who the greatest salesman in the world is?
That man, right there.
He sold the whole country, 200 million people... on himself.
In '68, it was...
He said he would end the war.
And what did he do?
He sent another 100, 000 troops... and then he bombed the living shit out of them.
Now, what did Nixon run on last year?
Ending the war in Vietnam.
That is a salesman.
He made a promise.
All over again.
That' s believing in yourself.
These, you listen to.
While you' re taking a shit in the morning.
You gotta believe, Sam.
This book right here will really teach you to believe in yourself.
This book right here will really teach you techniques.
I guarantee it.
<i>The salesman who believes is the salesman who receives. </ i>
<i>Remember, power is a state of mind. </ i>
<i>You have as much as you think you have. </ i>

<i>The salesman who believes is the salesman who receives. </ i>
- No.
- He just walked out, just now.
What' re you up to?
I just came by to give this.
This is what I owe him... and if you could just get that to him for me, I' d appreciate it.
Come on, Sam.
He didn' t go home?
He just ran out to the bank.
Sit down.
- Sit down.
I can' t sit down, Mel, but it' s very good to see you.
Don' t be a stranger.
Look at that.
You can keep that.
They made a thousand of them.
- A thousand?
- One thousand.
You look good, Sam.
I feel good.
I believe.
Amen, brother.
You' ve got to believe.
Sam Bicke, salesman.
All right, then.
You don' t think it' s a good idea.
You' ve got to know what' s right, Sam.
I didn' t say that.
How are my princesses?
- You did?
That' s great.
- Hi.
- Hey.
Looks good.
You can keep that.
- Thanks.
- It' s good to see you.
You know you' re supposed to call first.
I know.
What' s this?
I' m on a roll.
It' s done.
Do it.
- Yeah.
Marie...
I really think that this is gonna change things for us.
Sam, job sounds good.
Thanks.
- Mommy, Julie' s standing on the chair.
- Julie, come on, down.
I' m sorry.
Just call first.
- When?
- I don' t know.
- After 10: 00, though, all right?
I' il call you Sunday after 10: 00.
Mommy.
You look nice, Marie.
Hey, boy.
<i>What happened, Mr. Bernstein, to the land of plenty? </ i>
<i>Is that the American dream? </ i>
<i>Now remember, the customer' s weapon is money. </ i>
<i>That' s what he' il want to talk about.
<i>That' s what you' il insist on talking about.
Don' t get caught in the price game. </ i>
How much?
How much is it?
<i>This is $529. </ i>
I want to show you something.
This is...
It' s all right.
I know pretty much what to look for in a desk.
Sam, I' m gonna be buying a lot of stuff... and I' m just wondering, what' s your best price?
- All right.
Give it your best shot.
I' il do that.
Jesus!
It' s our selection of the month.
Can I see you in my office for a minute please, Sam?
Yes, I' il be right...
I' il be right with you.
What are you doing?
<i>Offering 10%?
- It' s already been marked down.
For Christ' s sake, that' s less than we paid for the damn thing.
I' m not interested in what you think.
I guess I could tell him...
You can' t tell him shit.
You' ve made the offer.
That' s it.
Go out and hope he doesn' t take it.
Sir, can I show you some of our other very nice...
Yes.
You' re on the board.
- You see him write that check?
- He did it to me, we do it to you.
- Sure.
- Good job, Sam.
But it' s not right.
No, you shouldn' t have.
What are you saying, that I should swallow something like that?
It makes me sad that you would accept something, of all people.
It is a big deal.
Bonny, if we' re going to be partners... we have to get this kind of thing straight.
I' ve been there.
- But, Bonny...
- What about my rights?
That' s what I' m saying, partner.
That' s all I' m saying.
Sam, it' s a job.
A man doesn' t give up his rights at a job.
You of all people should know that.
What should I know?
'Cause I' m black, I should mouth off to my boss?
Rights this, rights that.
It' s a job.
You got a right to pay your bills, pay for your kids.
I' m just saying you can' t keep quitting jobs.
We all gotta work somehow.
You' re a salesman, right?
Like you do.
<i>Explain this to me, Mr. Bernstein. </ i>
<i>Like my father and his father. </ i>
<i>Is that too much to expect? </ i>
Hey, boy.
You miss me, don' t you?
<i>But what good is good... </ i> <i>in times like these? </ i>
I' ve been trying to call.
It' s not a good time, Sam.
I know.
- You want to see a menu?
- Here you go.
I' il be right back.
I know.
Sorry.
It is good.
Remember Sam Jr.
That' s right.
Is everything okay at work?
Top of the charts.
I' m doing very well.
That' s great.
Maybe I' il be driving a Cadillac soon.
Who?
I drove by last night.
- No.
What you doing lurking around the house for?
You told me to call.
I called and nobody answered, so...
I said, try me, okay?
I don' t want to talk about this.
I respect that.
I just want you to know I' m not seeing anyone.
Okay, that' s your business.
It' s important to me that you know that.
Now I know.
I didn' t mean...
Can I call you later?
- All right.
Bernstein, sir, there are people who sit and wait their lives away... </ i> <i>on the promise of a dream that will not come. </ i>
<i>They are the sheep. </ i>
<i> - who will not be pushed around.
Hi.
I' m Sam Bicke.
Harold.
- How are you?
I' m not police.
I' m Sam Bicke.
Yeah, I got that.
What can I do for you?
As a matter of fact...
Except that I' m white.
We' ve all got to be born something.
Do you know what that means?
I mean, I' m white, but I' m in the same boat.
You own the boat.
That' s not me.
May I?
I feel like I can talk to you.
And I want to do something.
You want to do something?
Like the Black Panthers, I want to do something...
The system is not right.
I have to go, but I want to throw an idea at you.
Zebras.
See, they' re black and they' re white.
The Black Panthers become the Zebras... and membership will double.
Just think about it.
I wanted to feel like I was starting to do something.
Sam.
It' s a great start.
Take a look.
- You see what I see?
- What' s that?
You' re familiar with Carnegie, right?
<i>Dale Carnegie.
Oh, yes.
I know the book.
No, you don' t.
But you don' t know the book.
"Always give a dog a good name."
Always give a dog a name.
You' ve really got to listen better.
I' m sorry.
It' s a Carnegie technique for dealing with people.
Right?
Instead you say:
"Your work used to be great, now it' s not so great."
And then you ask them a question like:
"Everything okay at home?"
Are you asking me?
I' m teaching you.
You just learned a management technique.
Sir.
- Good.
Just one more little thing.
Shave it off.
I won' t forget.
Marie, don' t you remember?
Remember what?
Daddy, do you like my picture?
Yes, honey, it' s very nice.
I grew it for you.
Sam, please.
God damn it.
I mean they don' t have any right... to say half of the things that they say to us.
I mean, look at the way they make you dress.
I dress like this so I can support my family.
Can' t you see what they' re doing to us?
You' re going to lose this job, aren' t you?
What?
I' m not going to lose my job.
Just tell me now, because I can do it on my own.
I' m doing great.
I' m so tired of this.
I don' t want you stopping by like this anymore.
I really mean it.
And it makes me look a little older and trustworthy.
That' s not really the point, though.
I really am.
Because I would think that you would have more feeling.
You sit.
Joey.
Yes, ma' am.
I bet she did.
No offense, but I wouldn' t be surprised... if his father had a little something to do with that.
He probably got something from me.
If your father went away... would that make you sad?
He' s not gonna go away.
If your mommy wanted him to go.
She wouldn' t say that.
Give your father a kiss.
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, baby.
Things will work out, Sam.
- Good night, Mommy.
Say good night to your Uncle Sam.
Good night, Uncle Sam.
Good night, son.
I want to thank you for the sacrifice.
I think it was a good decision.
Now you can smile.
You look like a family man instead of some schmuck with a pussy on his face.
- Yes.
Get up to the spic' s place and get me an egg salad... and whatever else you want.
<i>You don' t have any idea what it' s like to work for somebody else... </ i>
<i>Remember power is a state of mind. </ i>

I' m not sure I understand this business about the school bus.
The bus is the business.
It' s a movable store.
- Exactly.
Then you bring the tires to the customer, at his convenience.
You' re a delivery service.
That' s just the beginning of it, because I would bring the tire... and change it, I' il put the tire on your car while you' re mowing the lawn.
And we' d paint the bus a bright red because that would give the company... its own individual identity and make it memorable.
And you have the bus already?
And I bring the management experience.
And that you have as well?
Yes, I do.
It says here you' re currently employed as an office furniture salesman?
That' s correct.
But I' m ready to move on.
And prior to office sales, you were a tire salesman with your father?
Julius Bicke, that' s my brother.
Brother.
Okay, and why did you leave his employment?
I don' t believe that someone should have to lie to make a living.
Sell below that, we lose money.
<i>So, 30 is rock bottom. </ i>
Let me show you.
Good morning, Mr. Ford.
I think I understand, Mr. Bicke...
Let me just show you.
Good morning.
Sam Bicke.
You' re here to buy tires.
Let' s get down to brass tacks.
<i>The markup on all of my tires is 30%. </ i>
I' il do that for you, Mr. Ford.
I' il make you my best offer.
I' il split the difference with you.
I' il take half the markup as my profit... and you' il take half the markup as your savings.
Fair deal.
What do you think?
What do I think?
No, I' m back to normal now.
- Exactly. </ i>
No.
My brother... <i>will go to 15%, but he wants you to hold at list. </ i>
He' s a man who doesn' t know how to hold his ground.
The one with the biggest profit margin?
The biggest liar.
That I would not ask my salesmen to lie... or make them feel like a failure... or some kind of a piece of garbage.
I admire that.
- Your idea?
Well, that' s it.
That' s it?
I think it can change the way we think about American business.
I have to send your application on to Washington... and they will review it.
And it' s a whole process.
Of course.
Mr. Ford at the SBA...
Bonny, I gotta tell you, he was very impressed.
Did you tell him the bus don' t run?
I did, yes.
I checked the "Negro" box.
This isn' t working.
No, Bonny.
The government is looking for black businessmen.
I' ve been here 16 years, and they haven' t found me yet.
Ellen, sit next to Julie.
Come on, son.
That' s great, Julie.
Ellen, sit next to your sister.
Come on, Sam Jr.
Ellen, honey, sit next to Julie.
Dinner' s ready.
Daddy' s taking a picture.
That' s all right, honey, I got it.
- Yeah, I' il see you next Sunday.
Tuffer!
Thank you.
She' s got the dimples, also, when she smiles.
I should shop here more often.
You should, miss, or is it missus?
Miss.
- Yes.
Would you like me to deliver it?
No.
I' il have someone from the office stop by.
It wouldn' t be a problem.
I' il be just fine.
I don' t want you to deliver it.
We have people who deliver.
I think there' s been a misunderstanding.
I love my wife very much.
We are all married men.
Because... what' s odd about your aborted flirtation with that woman today... according to Marty' s recollection, correct me if I' m wrong... is that you referred to her dimples... as being like those of your ex- wife' s.
I think there' s been a misunderstanding.
A divorced salesman fails at selling, the same as marriage.
lie to some broad about not being married when he is.
That' s to be expected.
But you wouldn' t expect that guy to lie to his boss, would you?
I didn' t want you to think that I was being dishonest to my wife.
You did try to pick her up then?
My son was correct in his estimation of your character?
And if I were to ask you and your wife to join... me and Marty and our wives for dinner in, say, a week or two... that would be okay with you?
Yes, I think that...
she' d like that very much.
<i>When I was little I was taught not to be rude, Mr. Bernstein, but... </ i> <i>what am I supposed to do about the people who won' t respect me? </ i>
What I wanted to do is just check on the status of my application.
Sorry, Mr. Bicke.
Mr. Ford should have told you, but processing takes eight to ten weeks.
No, he did not tell me that.
Perhaps you could check back, say, September 1.
- Yes.
But I am a businessman... and a businessman can' t wait.
Samuel J.
I will talk to Mr. Ford... and if he has time for a meeting, we' il call you next week.
Since I' m here, maybe I could just see him...
If he has time, we' il call you next week.
Deal?
Deal.
Least you could do is discourage him.
For God' s sake, Sam, aren' t we done yet?
Would you consider going to the dinner?
You could drive your own car.
I' m not gonna put on some charade.
If you' re their top salesman... what do they care if you' re married, divorced, or queer?
Sir, you should be ashamed of yourself.
They make her wear that.
Really, it' s all right.
He' il understand.
That' s all the time...
- Mr. Bicke.
It' s good to see you, sir.
Why don' t we step outside and get a cup of coffee?
Coffee.
In the cafeteria.
Actually, there' s a machine in the lobby.
The lobby' s fine.
Have a seat.
Now, how exactly can I help you, Mr. Bicke?
It' s very urgent that I get this thing rolling, if you know what I mean.
No, I don' t.
The bus thing.
Now there' s really nothing more I can do.
You can' t tell me anything else?
No, I can' t.
You' il be notified by mail.
It will take eight to ten weeks and you' il be notified by mail.
Now, I have to get back.
Is there some way that this could be speeded up?
Is there some way that could happen?
No, there isn' t.
Impatience is not a virtue, Mr. Bicke.
Good luck.
In the mail then?
<i>He would not, he said, "Betray the working classes." In the end he found... </ i>
<i>Who are these men, Maestro... </ i> <i>who keep us waiting at their feet? </ i>
<i>The earth belongs to the bullies who do not care how they get to the top... </ i> <i>as long as they arrive. </ i>
<i>But I will not go quietly. </ i>
You' ve just got to have a little more patience.
It' s all about money.
Now what?
- You got a problem?
I paid you to fix the leak.
- You' ve still got one?
- I' ve got half- a- fucking- dozen of them.
- You sound like you' re having a bad day.
- I' m having a bad day with this fucking car.
- You have a nice day, now.
What is the matter with you?
This thing is loaded.
So you start swinging this fucking thing around?
- He didn' t respect you.
You think I' m losing sleep over that bullshit?
But how can you take that racist crap?
Just because I didn' t cuss his ass out doesn' t mean I took shit off of him.
And I sure as shit ain' t some Uncle Tom, if that' s what you' re trying to say.
Are we clear on that?
I didn' t mean that.
I' m so sorry, Bonny.
Are we still friends?
Yeah, we' re friends.
She' s your daughter, but she' s my wife and you have to tell me where Marie is.
Mrs. Anderson, where is Marie?
Then I' il just have to keep calling.
<i>9082.
Marie Bicke, please.
<i>It' s 3: 27 in the morning and I demand to speak to my wife. </ i>
That' s right, this is Sam Bicke, and who is this?
Who is this, sir?
Marie?
No, you hold on.
It certainly has not been two years.
Why would you say that, Marie?
When you' re...
God damn it!
I appreciate all the time you' ve taken.
As I said before, I have to still measure the space.
This doesn' t have to be done today because we' il be here in the morning.
God damn it!
What did you just do?
This is my last day.
I' m starting my own business... and I have an enormous amount of plans that I have to make.
Have your desk cleared in 10 minutes.
<i>I sold my apartment in New York... </ i>
It' s about money, Dick.
<i>I don' t think that was gone into with much detail. </ i>
Roger Zeffler, please.
No. <i>... prick the boil and take the heat. </ i>
You' re the prick.
Hello, Roger.
No, I wasn' t saying that.
This is Sam Bicke.
I' m handling shipping and receiving for him.
We' re opening an outlet in the Hill district.
Yes, that' s the correct address.
If you could just drop- ship those, that would be fine.
<i>let them know I was nervous... </ i> <i>that unlike the powerful, I was not so arrogant... </ i> <i>as to be sure that my actions were righteous. </ i>
<i>He just wanted to make a change.
<i>And he aimed high. </ i>
The landlord was kind enough to allow me in.
I see you received his note.
We have some things to discuss, don' t you think?
To discuss?
- Good seeing you, of course.
You' re a very strange man, Samuel.
I' ve always known this.
So why would you steal from me, your brother?
- I didn' t steal...
I had to bail your friend, Bonny, out of jail this evening.
Bonny?
For receiving stolen goods.
Did you think Roger Zeffler wouldn' t become suspicious of your friend?
That 550 tires belonged to that address? </ i>
Roger Zeffler is a racist.
Shame on Roger Zeffler.
But you are a crook.
Which shame is greater?
- I am not...
This is your brother.
Do I deserve this now, for you to lie to me?
No.
Because I took responsibility, Samuel.
So that this man, Bonny, your friend, would not go to jail.
And my family caused this.
So you must tell me, Sam, please... which is the greater shame?
I' m sorry, Julius.
What is your name?
For a tire business.
Nixon.
Like Zeffler.
I didn' t get the money because my partner is black.
And the little guy just can' t do it anymore.
But somebody has to resist.
You' re my brother.
No more.
That' s it.
I will send you to jail.
<i>It wasn' t like a light bulb really. </ i>
<i>But in that moment, Mr. Bernstein, I knew... </ i> <i>the die was cast. </ i>
<i>Your music... </ i> <i>is both pure and honest. </ i>
<i>$120, 40, 60, 80, 200. </ i>
There you are, Mr. Bicke.
All cashed out.
But that won' t be easy. </ i>
<i>Let the system dangle till it doesn' t breathe. </ i>
<i>And I am going to do it. </ i>
I' m sure it' s just...
Thank you.
If you do what I say, no one will be hurt.
I have to take control here.
<i>I hope that he will forgive me for stealing his gun. </ i>
They let you in looking like that?
I' m sorry things didn' t work out.
I wanted to thank you for teaching me... that to be a salesman... you don' t have to be a good man.
You got a fever, Bicke?
You' re sweating like a pig.
Here, wipe your forehead, for Christ' s sake.
You all right, son?
You love me.
Because I would never leave you.
Good boy.
Sir?
Excuse me.
Nobody move.
I' il kill you.
I' ve got a bomb, I' il kill you.
Close that door.
Sir, please just calm down.
We' re gonna take care of anything you need.
No!
If you don' t move, then no one will get hurt.
If you don' t move, then no one will get hurt.
I want you to fly this plane.
I want you to fly it low.
I hear you, Sam.
I' m gonna call the tower.
You have to help him to fly the plane.
She' s gonna help you fly the plane.
You have to move him.
Please let me go.

I am no one special, just a common man with common thoughts.
I' ve led a common life.
And my name will soon be forgotten.
I' ve succeeded as gloriously as anyone who ever lived.
- Looking good, Duke.
- Feeling good.
I' ve loved another with all my heart and soul and for me that has always been enough.
How' s it hanging, Harry?
I keep trying to die, but they won' t let me.
Well, you can' t have everything.
Big day today.
You say that every day, you old devil.
It' s a lovely day outside.
Let' s take a walk.
Well, we' ve got to get you out of this room.
- would do you good.
- Hello.
I' m sorry, it' s not a good day.
I don' t think she' s up for anything.
This is Duke, he' s come to read to you.
I don' t know.
Oh, come on, you' il like him, he' s very funny.
All right now, where did we leave off?
Oh, yeah, yeah, it was the night of the carnival.
- Noah?
- That' s where they met...
June 6th, 1940.
Allie was 17 years old.
- Damn!
- Thank you for playing.
- Ha, you' re real funny.
Man, I clobbered that thing.
I' m tellin 'you, these games are fixed.
Hi, what' s your name?
- Who' s this girl with Sara?
- Her name' s Allie Hamilton.
She' s here for the summer with her family.
Dad' s got more money than God.
- Hi, honey.
Look, I won you a prize.
Oh, Fin, thank you!
- Umm, okay.
- That would be so much fun.
- You want to dance with me?
- No.
- Why not?
- 'Cause I don' t want to.
Noah, she' s with us.
Hey Allie, you want to ride the Ferris wheel?
- I' d love to.
- Noah Calhoun.
Works down at the lumber yard with Fin.
Did you see he was standing like two inches away from my face?
Yeah, I saw.
That' s Noah, though.
You know I' m surprised he even came over.
I think he likes you.
- Well, I... ugh!
- Hey, you can' t do that!
I' il pay you when I get down, Tommy.
- So?!
- So, it' s really nice to meet you.
- Allie, who is this guy?
- I don' t know, Noah Calhoun.
- Friend!
Do you mind?
You can' t sit more than two people in a chair, Noah.
Okay, Tommy, all right.
Get down, Noah, you' re gonna kill yourself!
Noah, cut it out.
Now, will you go out with me?
What?
- No.
- No?
Hey pal, she just told you.
Why not?
I don' t know, because I don' t want to.
Well, you leave me no other choice then.
Oh my God.
- Noah, stop fooling around.
- What are you doing?
- I' m gonna ask you one more time.
- or will you not go out with me?
- God damn, my hand' s slipping.
- Then grab the bar, you idiot.
- Ah, go on out with him, honey.
- Okay, okay, fine, I' il go out with you.
- No, don' t do me any favors.
I want to.
You want to?
- Say it.
- I want to go out with you.
All right, all right we' il go out.
You think you' re so smart, don' t you?
That wasn' t funny, Noah, you idiot!
No, it' s okay, I' il take care of this.
Please don' t do that.
Please don' t do that, Allie.
You' re not so cocky now, are ya?
I' m gonna get you for that.
Ah, maybe you will, maybe you won' t.
- Oh, yeah, will you look at that?
It' s that girl from the Carnival, right?
Do you remember me?
Yeah, sure, Mr. Underwear, was it?
- How could I forget.
Yeah, I wanted to clear that up with you, because I' m really sorry about that.
But I had to be next to you.
I was being drawn to you.
Oh... oh, jeez, what a line!
You use that on all the girls?
- No.
I saw you the other night with little Miss Ribbons.
- What are you doing tonight?
Or tomorrow night, or this weekend, whatever.
- Why?
Our date.
What date?
- No...
You promised and you swore it.
Well, I guess I changed my mind.
Look, I know you get some dirty guy coming up to you on the street... you don' t know him.
You don' t know me, but I know me.
I love it.
I mean, I go crazy for it.
Okay, what are you talking about?
Well, you.
- You' re good.
- You' re good.
- You' re fantastic.
You really are.
- I' m not usually like this, I' m sorry.
- Oh, yes, you are.
I can be fun, if you want... pensive, uh, smart, uh, superstitious, brave.
And uh...
I could be whatever you want.
You just tell me what you want and I' il be that for you.
You' re dumb.
I could be that.
Umm...
I don' t think so.
Well, what I can I do to change your mind?
Guess you' il figure something out.
- You sure she' s coming?
- Relax, pal, it' s all set up.
We' re meeting her for the late show.
Oh my goodness, what a coincidence!
- He' s here!
- Allie, you remember Noah, don' t you?
- Yeah.
- Hi.
- It' s nice to see you again.
- You look great.
- Aw, thanks.
Really, really great.
You look great.
And I know I look great, so could we please go see this movie?
You come back here, Li' I Abner.
You ain' t gonna catch me, Daisy Mae!
It' s Sadie Hawkins Day, I' m supposed to catch you!
I' m faster than you.
No, No!
I' il get you!
Here I come!
You ketchum Polecat far and squar.
What happened in that movie?
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- What are you guys doing?
Yeah, what' s going on?
- We' re gonna walk.
Huh?
- You guys do love each other.
- Don' t do anything I wouldn' t do.
- All right, all right.
That was fun.
I haven' t seen a movie in ages.
- Huh- uh.
Not since I was a little kid.
What?
I' m busy, you know, I don' t have a lot of time.
- Mm- hmm.
I have a very strict schedule.
My days are all planned out.
And after dinner I spend time with my family.
I catch up on some reading.
Sounds like the road to success.
Oh, you bet.
We' re applying to all these colleges... umm...
Radcliffe, Sarah Lawrence... those are the ones we want.
- And who' s we?
You just said, "The ones that we want."
Oh, Mom and Daddy.
We decide everything together.
Everything?
No, not everything.
And then everything else, you get to decide all by yourself?
- Don' t be rude.
- I' m sorry.
Just trying to figure out what you do for fun.
What do you mean?
I don' t know, I mean all those things are things you have to do, right?
So what do you do because you want to?
I just told ya.
I don' t know.
This surprises me.
Why?
I just always figured you were kinda...
Kinda what?
- Free.
- What?
I am free.
You don' t seem like it.
Well, I am.
- Noah, what are you doing?
- Just come on.
- You' re gonna get run over.
- By all the cars?
My Dad and I used to come out here and lay down and watch the lights change.
And watch them go from green to red to yellow.
You could try it, if you wanted to.
- No.
- Why not?
Because I don' t know... will you just get up?
That' s your problem, you know that?
You don' t do what you want.
What happens if a car comes?
- We die.
Just relax.
You need to learn how to trust.
- Hmm?
You asked me what I do for me.
- What now?
- I love to paint.
- Yeah?
Most of the time, I have all these thoughts bouncing around in my head.
But with a brush in my hand, the world just gets kinda quiet.
Get out of the street!
Are you okay?
Why are you laughing?
Oh, that was fun.
Sure.
- Here?
Who said dance in the street?
And we don' t have any music.
Well, we' il make some.
You' re a terrible singer.
I know.
But I like this song.
- Southern summers are indifferent to the trials of young love.
Noah and Allie gave a remarkably convincing portrayal of a boy and a girl traveling down a very long road with no regard for the consequences.
They fell in love, didn' t they?
- Yes, they did.
- Good.
I like this kind of story.
Allie and Noah spent every waking hour together.
And soon they were inseparable.
- Mmm, mmm, mmm...
The negligent list of one after another, as I happen to call them to me.
Or drink to them.
The real poems, what we call poems, being merely pictures.
And of men like me.
And that all men carry. "
Not bad for Whitman.
Hey, look, we got a visitor.
I' m sorry, I didn' t mean to interrupt.
Well, don' t apologize, come on up here, darling.
We could use a little something here besides the smell of lumber.
Dad, this is Allison Hamilton.
Allison, I' m glad to meet you.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Calhoun.
What, am I old or something?
You can call me Frank.
- Okay.
Well, yeah, she is pretty, son.
- She' s a lot prettier than you let on.
- Oh, is that right?
Don' t believe what he says.
- What is this you got?
I brought you something.
Let' s have a look.
- Did you do this?
Well, that' s beautiful.
That' s a damn picture there.
Well, I know just where we can put that, thank you.
Oh, that was a lovely poem.
What was it?
- Whitman.
See when he was a little kid he used to stutter real bad.
- Dad...
- I didn' t know that.
Stammered, stutter, what' s the difference?
Couldn' t understand a damn thing he said.
So, I got him to read me poetry out loud.
It wasn' t very pretty at first, but then his stutter went away.
Well, it' s a good idea, that poetry.
- Yeah, I thought so.
Unbelievable, unbelievable.
For some reason, I don' t know.
Would you like some breakfast?
- Breakfast?
- Yeah.
- Dad, it' s 10: 00.
You can have pancakes any damn time of night you want.
- Come on, you want some breakfast?
- Sure.
It was an improbable romance.
He was a country boy.
She had the world at her feet, while he didn' t have two dimes to rub together.
Noah, come on.
Look at us.
What are we doing?
Do you think in another life, I could have been a bird?
What do you mean?
Like reincarnation.
I don' t know.
I think I could.
Say I' m a bird.
No.
- Say I' m a bird.
- Stop it.
Stop it now.
- Say it!
- You' re a bird.
Now say you' re a bird too.
If you' re a bird, I' m a bird.
Here we go, on the count of three, okay?
Real easy, on three, ready?
- Two... two...
- two...... three!
I can' t.
Get in the water!
- Come on, chicken.
Get in the water, baby.
- Get in the water.
- I can' t.
- Get in the water!
- Two...
I don' t understand what you' re talking about.
They didn' t agree on much.
They fought all the time.
And they challenged each other every day.
But despite their differences, they had one important thing in common.
They were crazy about each other.
- No.
- Yes, I do.
Allie.
Daddy.
I didn' t see you there.
You kinda scared me.
Becoming friendly with that boy down there.
Yes.
I want to meet this young man.
Okay.
Good night.
Oh, boy.
This bug goes "Daddy, I don' t understand."
He goes, "Well, in theory, we' re both millionaires, but in reality, we live with a bunch of whores."
Bishop Stevens told me that.
Olivier, please remove the... the liquor decanter from in front of my husband.
I think he' s had a little too much to drink.
So, what do you do, Noah?
I work at the lumber yard with Fin.
Mainly milling and receiving logs... and stripping the bark.
Oh, that' s lovely, dear.
Thank you.
If you don' t mind my asking, uh, how much do you make at your job?
Uh, how much money do I make?
About 40 cents an hour.
Yeah, it' s not much, but I don' t need a lot.
I save most of it.
Shall we?
Oh, it looks delicious.
So Noah, you and Allie have been spending a lot of time together.
You must be very fond of each other.
It' s getting pretty serious, huh?
Yes, ma' am.
Well, summer' s almost gone.
What will you do?
You know, Charleston' s only a couple of hours away.
But Allie' s going to Sarah Lawrence.
Didn' t she tell you?
No, she didn' t tell me that.
I just got the letter.
It' s okay.
And Sarah Lawrence is in New York.
I didn' t know that.
Anne, this conversation' s too stuffy for the dinner table.
Let the children have fun without bringing in the Spanish Inquisition.
My lips are buttoned, right now.
I do know another joke about the Nun and the full standing bishop.
I' m leaving the table if you tell another joke.
That child' s got too much spirit for a girl of her circumstance.
Nah, it' s just summer love.
Trouble is what it is.
Is that Allie out there?
Okay.
Wait here.
Allie!
Come on.
No, don' t...
All right, just stay there.
Don' t open your eyes.
The Windsor Plantation.
It was built in 1772.
Proposed to his wife right here under these... uh, these steps.
Look at that.
This place is gigantic.
Yeah, a gigantic piece of crap.
But I' m gonna buy it one day and I' m gonna fix it up.
And new walls and a roof.
- Is that all?
- And plumbing and electric.
- And furniture.
- Yes, and furniture.
But it' s right on the water.
I could turn that into my workshop.
Well, what about me?
Now don' t I get any say in this?
You want a say in this?
Yes, I would.
- with blue shutters...
And a room overlooking the river so I can paint.
- Anything else?
I want a big old porch that wraps around the entire house.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa... and watch the sun go down.
- Okay.
- You promise?
Mm- hmm, I promise.
Good.
- Where are you going?
- In here.
I can' t play chopsticks if you' re doing that.
Oh, make love to me.
- Yeah?
Um...
- but I think you...
You' re gonna have to talk me through this.
- Yeah.
- Did I hurt you?
- No, no.
I' m just...
I' m just having a lot of... never mind.
What are you thinking, right now?
You know, right this second?
Did you know that this was going to happen when you brought me here?
- No.
- No, you didn' t think about it?
- You did?
- Uh- huh.
- Well, what did you think?
Uh, I' m talking too much, aren' t I?
Okay, okay, I' m just going to shut up.
Mum' s the word.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
I just don' t understand how come you' re so quiet.
You don' t have one thought?
You don' t have a care in the world?
I' m sorry.
Now I can' t shut up.
I love you.
Did you know that?
I love you too.
You don' t have to do this if you don' t want to.
No, no, I want to, I do.
What?
Look, I' m sorry, but Allie' s parents are going crazy.
They got every cop in town out looking for her.
- Yes.
We sent the police.
Thank God you' re all right.
Mr. Hamilton, all this is my fault.
Would you give us a moment please?
I' d like to talk to my daughter.
Alone, young lady.
Thanks for everything, Lieutenant.
You bet, John, anytime.
You go straight home now, it' s late.
Sir, it' s really not her fault.
I lost track of time.
Sit down.
I' m sorry, Daddy.
- Is he a rapist?
- You are going to stop seeing Noah.
She is out fooling around with that boy till 2: 00 in the morning and it has got to stop.
I didn' t spend 17 years of my life raising a daughter and giving her everything... so she could throw it away on a summer romance.
She will wind up with her heart broken or pregnant.
- He' s a nice boy, but he' s...
- He' s what?
He' s what?
He is trash, trash, trash... not for you.
Trash?
Don' t touch me!
Now that is enough.
And that' s final.
- No, it' s not final.
- No, it' s not final!
You' re not going to tell me who I' m gonna love.
- Yes Daddy, I love him.
I love him.
He' s not suitable for you, baby.
I love him.
You are 17 years old, you don' t know anything about love.
Oh, and you do?
You don' t look at Daddy the way I look at Noah.
You don' t play.
You don' t know anything about love.
You leaving?
Oh my God, I' m so sorry.
I don' t even know what to say.
- It' s all right.
- Yeah.
- I' m gonna go.
- No, I don' t want you to go.
I got to think about some stuff.
What do you got to think about, huh?
Come here and talk to me.
Talk to me!
About what?
You want... you' re going away!
And I' m staying here.
And I' m so happy that you' re doing it, but you' re gonna have a million things to do.
- You got so much ahead of you.
- Don' t talk like that.
I' m not going to have nice things, fancy things.
It' s never gonna happen for me.
It' s not in the cards for me.
I don' t have to go to school, okay?
- Yes, you do.
- I can stay here.
Do you see, that' s exactly what I am talking about.
Then you can come with me.
- Yes.
What am I going to do in New York?
Be with me?
Yeah.
I don' t know.
We don' t got to figure all this out tonight, ya know?
We' il finish out the summer and we' il see what happens.
You saying you want to break it off?
What I' m saying we see how it goes later on.
Are you breaking up with me?
I don' t see how it' s gonna work.
I see...
Please don' t do this.
You don' t mean it.
Oh hell, well if you' re going to do it, why wait until the summer ends, huh?
Why don' t you just do it, right now?
Do it!
Do it!
Do it!
Stop it!
You know what?
I' m gonna do it.
Okay?
- Don' t touch me.
I hate you, I hate you.
I' m gonna go.
Why don' t you, why don' t you just go.
Get out.
No, no, just wait a minute.
Come on.
This is just a fight we' re having, and tomorrow it will be like it never happened, right?
- Going?
- Gone.
Well, she must have been devastated.
She was.
He was only trying to do the right thing.
Just stick it where the sun don' t shine.
Yeah, you' re right, probably should have.
The next day, Allie woke up to find her world completely changed.
What' s going on?
We' re going home.
No, we' re not supposed to be leaving for another week.
Get dressed and then come and have some breakfast, dear.
Willow will pack your things.
Why, I' d be happy to pack your things, Miss Allie.
I don' t want you to pack my things.
I' m not going.
- No, I' m not.
- Yes, Allie, you are.
Allie, you are going whether you like it or not.
Now, even if Aaron has to throw you over his shoulder and drag you the whole way, you' re going.
We have to have all these done by lunch.
Where' s Noah?
He' s out delivering a load.
- What' s going on?
- I' m leaving town.
- Leaving?
- When?
- Now, right now... like today.
Look, I need you to tell Noah something, okay?
And tell him that I' m sorry for everything, okay?
Look, I was up all night with him, Allie.
I' ve never seen him so low.
It' s over.
No!
No, it' s not over.
No, we said some things we didn' t mean, but it' s not over.
- No.
Let it go.
Mama, I' m coming!
- Look, he understands.
It' s hard, but he really does.
Summer' s over and it' s time to go home.
If not?
Okay, can you just... can you just tell him that I love him, then?
- I' il tell him.
Bye, Fin.
Summer romances end for all kinds of reasons.
But when all is said and done, they have one thing in common:
They are shooting stars... a spectacular moment of light in the heavens, a fleeting glimpse of eternity.
And in a flash, they' re gone.
Noah was desperate.
He wrote to Allie that he was sorry and stupid for breaking up with her.
He wrote to tell her that he still loved her, and he wanted to see her.
And that if she would write back, he would come to wherever she was.
He wrote one letter a day for a year... 365 letters, but they all went unanswered.
Nothing?
Sorry.
All right, thank you.
Finally, after a year of silence, he decided to put it all behind him and start a new life.
And he and Fin packed their bags and headed for Atlanta.
Come on, listen to this!
The Constitution of the United States, against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
Noah and Fin enlisted together.
And after two years of chasing Rommel through the North African desert, they were deployed to Patton' s Third Army in Europe.
Fin!
Do I contradict myself?
Very well then, I contradict myself.
Allie was in her third year of college when she volunteered as a nurse' s aid.
To her, the broken men with shattered bodies, who filled the ward were all Noah.
Or someone who fought beside him in the jungle or frozen snow swept road.
I' m gonna lift you up.
Ready?
Now, I' m gonna bring this leg over.
- You okay?
Miss, can I ask you a question?
I noticed that you aren' t wearing a ring.
And I was wondering if I could take you out.
- Excuse me?
- On a date.
I' il have you know that I am an excellent dancer and my intentions are completely dishonorable.
Okay, okay "Casanova," come on.
Let' s just get you better, then we' il talk about a date, okay?
Would you get a load of him?
Oh my gosh, he is dreamy.
- What is he doing here?
He' s staring at you.
Oh, miss?
I' m all better.
Now, how' s about that date?
Allie was surprised how quickly she fell in love with Lon Hammond.
He was handsome, smart, funny, sophisticated and charming.
He also came from old Southern money, and was fabulously wealthy.
- Where they going?
- See you later, sweetheart.
Okay, I give up, why shouldn' t we get married?
An then, it just dawned on me.
- My parents?
- Your old mom and dad.
Thank you for that.
You see, the problem is that they love me.
- I' m exactly the type of man - They do.
You know, I' m wealthy, I' m from the South, I got a decent job.
You know, I' m an incredible dancer, I' m a really smart guy.
You look great.
- So what' s the problem, huh?
- Now just this, if you marry me...
- Now listen close.
Then you will have lost a life long battle of defiance against them.
Oh my goodness, what are we going to do?
- I do not know.
Hey, band, you feeling all right?
- Oh bop sha bam, shi bimmy bop - You say it!
See Allie, I think... damn it, I think you have to marry me.
- I think you need to marry me.
Because if you do, you parents will always know the unhappiness that you feel for not being able to disappoint them.
I think you may have overlooked one minor detail.
Well, you see you have to get their permission first.
Is that right?
- Mm- hmm.
- Oh, I don' t think so.
Oh, 'cause I asked them already and they said yes.
What?
One more thing.
I love you.
Will you marry me, honey?
I know I kid around a lot, but I' m crazy about you.
Make me the happiest man in the world.
Yes.
- Just hold tight.
Oh my God.
Mama.
Okay, stop the band.
I' d like everyone here to know that this young lady and I are getting married.
Noah' s face came to her mind.
Let me see you.
You bleeding anywhere?
- Everything good?
- Yeah.
Oh, I love you.
- Come on.
What' s going on?
What is this?
Here.
I sold the house.
Gotta be out by the end of the month.
Between that and your GI Bill, you ought to be able to get it now.
- Get what?
- The Windsor Plantation.
- Dad...
I already talked to the bank, they' re gonna give you the loan.
- Well, I can' t let you sell your house.
It' s a good thing.
You should do it.
Wait a second.
You sell the house, where are you gonna live?
With you, dummy, what do you think?
Somebody' s got to help you fix it up.
Noah took a look at the house, but only saw one thing...
Allie.
He decided right there to fulfill his life- long dream.
He would rebuild the old house from the ground up.
And when Noah went to Charleston to get the building plans approved, fate stepped in and dealt him a sweet card.
Stop the bus!
Sorry, Mac, I can' t stop the bus until I get to the depot.
No, no, no, please stop the bus now.
Do you understand English, pal?
No one gets off till we get to the depot.
Now sit down.
After seeing Allie that day, something inside Noah snapped.
He got the notion into his head that if he restored the old house where they had come that night,
Allie would find a way to come back to him.
Others called it something else.
But in fact, Noah had gone a little mad.
- Would...
Lunch will be served in the Sun Room today.
The melon is good.
Noah and Allie?
Now you don' t want me to spoil the end of the story before I get to the good part, do you?
Where did I leave off?
When Noah' s father died in November, the house was all he had.
In time, Noah finished the house.
He took a good look at what he had accomplished, got rip- roaring drunk for 10 days, thought seriously about setting it on fire, then finally put the house up for sale.
I' m prepared to offer you this much.
He had a number of interested buyers, but he always found a reason not to sell it to them.
Either the bids were too low, or if they met his asking price, he felt it was worth a lot more.
It' s a lot of money, but I' il take it.
$50, 000.
- That' s more than my asking price.
- That' s right.
It' s a great deal more.
He told the man that offered him $5, 000 over his price that no one in his right mind would do that and he wouldn' t have a lunatic living in his house.
He worked out his frustration with life on the creek every morning.
And in the evenings, to temper the sting of loneliness, there was Martha Shaw.
Martha was a war widow who lived in Quail Ridge, a town away.
So you want to go out tomorrow?
I got to work.
Well, we could down to the river if you want to.
Next week, sometime.
Maybe we could take a drive somewhere?
No.
Well, I' m just asking you.
What do you want, Noah?
What do you mean, what do I want?
From me.
Sometimes when you talk to me, you don' t even see me.
Look, a woman knows when a man looks into her eyes and sees someone else.
Now you know I want to give you all the things that you want, right?
But I can' t, because they' re gone...
they' re broken.
All right?
Is the veil too much?
You look perfect!
- You look gorgeous, honey.
Wait until Lon sees you in this dress, he' s gonna go crazy.
He won' t be able to take his eyes off you, or his hands.
Have you seen this morning' s paper?
- the social highlight of the season.
This is gonna be a celebration the likes of which this town' s never seen!
She doesn' t plan, she plots, doesn' t she?
- Mama, look, the Governor' s coming.
Let me see.
Oh, boy.
- We' re 82 now.
- We' re 89 now.
89, great, up from 85.
You have a visitor.
Baby, I didn' t know you were coming.
I' m so sorry, I should have called.
Baby, what are you talking about?
- All right.
Yes, sir.
Miss Allie.
So what' s up?
I don' t paint anymore.
I used to paint all the time.
I really loved it.
- I didn' t know that.
So paint.
I will.
- I' m gonna start.
- Great.
Is everything okay?
I need to get away.
I need to clear my head.
Okay, should I be worried?
- No, I don' t think so.
- Oh, that' s reassuring.
Listen, are you all right?
- Okay, then go.
Take your time, do whatever you need to do.
It' s normal to get cold feet before your wedding.
No, no second thoughts, huh- uh.
I love you.
I' m going to be back from Seabrook in a couple of days, okay?
- Yeah, Seabrook.
Hello.
I saw your picture in the paper, the one with you and the house.
And I just wanted to come and see if you were okay.
I mean, I wasn' t in the neighborhood or anything.
I just...
So are you okay?
Okay, good.
I' m a stupid woman, I shouldn' t have come.
You want to come in?
Okay.
This is a good story.
I' m glad you like it.
I think I' ve heard it before.
Yes.
Perhaps more than once?
- Me?
Now?
- No, him.
But he hasn' t finished reading his story.
I' il read some more when I' m through with the doctor.
This shouldn' t take too long.
- Don' t you go away.
I' il be right back.
While you waiting, maybe you' d like to play the piano for a few minutes.
You do like that.
- I do?
- I don' t know any tunes.
- You can read music.
- Mm- hmm.
Who are you?
I' m Dr. Barnwell, one of the new attending physicians.
We haven' t met, so I thought I' d examine you myself.
Okay, so I see here that you' ve had two heart attacks over the last 18 months.
Yeah, minor ones, I think one was angina.
- Okay, any complications?
- Nope, feel fine.
Okay, deep breath for me.
Okay, one more time.
And deep breath.
And one more.
You still taking your medication?
- Every day, twice a day.
- Good, good, good, good, good.
Okay, you can put your shirt on.
So I understand that you read to Miss Hamilton.
Yeah, to help her remember.
- You don' t think it' il help?
No, I don' t.
She remembers, Doc.
I read to her and she remembers.
Not always, but she remembers.
But senile dementia is irreversible.
It' s degenerative.
After a certain point, its victims don' t come back.
Yeah, that' s what they keep telling me.
Well, I just don' t want you to get your hopes up.
Well, thanks, Doc, but you know what they say?
Science goes only so far and then comes God.
Damn, I forgot to turn the page for her.
You through with me?
I guess they flipped that page.
No, that she' s playing by memory.
His name is Lon Hammond, Jr.
As in Hammond Cotton?
As in Hammond Cotton.
Well, your parents must love him.
He' s a really good man, Noah.
You' d really like him.
Yeah, I do.
I love him very much.
Well, that' s that.
You marry Lon and we can be friends... right?
Right.
Are you hungry?
Do you want to stay for dinner?
I have to warn you, I' m a cheap drunk.
A couple more of these and you' re gonna be carrying me right out of here.
Well, you go slow then, I don' t want to have to take advantage of you.
You wouldn' t dare.
I' m a married woman.
Not yet.
What?
Why are you looking at me like that?
Just memories.
This room.
This... is this where we...
This is the room?
- I' m full.
- Me too.
Your breath falls around me like dew.
Your pulse lulls the tympans of my ears.
Delicious enough. "
It was real, wasn' t it?
You and me.
Such a long time ago, we were just a couple of kids.
But we really loved each other, didn' t we?
I should go.
Goodbye.
Do you think you could back tomorrow morning?
There' s some place I' d like to show you.
Please.
- Okay.
like a sudden flame, blazing and streaming into his heart.
Noah stayed up all night contemplating the certain agony he knew would be his, if he were to lose her twice.
Oh, I do wish I could figure out the end of this story.
The children are here.
- Not yours, his.
Do you mind?
Why, I' d love to meet them.
Come over here.
- Hi, Daddy.
Hi, I' m Allie.
- Mary Allen.
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.
- Hi.
- Hi, Maggie.
Maggie, how are you?
Hi, Davanee.
- Thank you.
- Oh...
- Oh, how cute, thank you.
- And who' s this?
- Edmond.
Hi, Edmond.
You know, I think I' il run on up and take my afternoon nap, all right?
- There you go.
I' il read some more later.
All right, thank you.
I' m so happy to meet you all.
- She is good.
I don' t know, there' s something about today.
Maybe it' s a day for a miracle.
Daddy, come home.
She' il never understand.
We miss you.
This is crazy, you living here.
Yeah, you know we' il all help with Mom.
We can take shifts visiting.
Look, guys, that' s my sweetheart in there.
I' m not leaving her.
This is my home now.
- Hello?
- Hey, there.
Hi, who is this?
It' s Lon, who were you expecting?
Uh, nobody, I...
How... how did you find me?
Well, there' s only one hotel in Seabrook.
And when you didn' t call, I got worried.
Where you been?
Are you all right?
You know, I feel like an idiot, 'cause I called your hotel about a hundred times.
I' m fine.
- No?
Okay.
Lon, I love you.
Call you tomorrow?
Okay.
Hey, there.
Well, we better get going, the rain' s coming in.
- You like it?
- It' s spectacular.
It' s like a dream.
- Do you want to feed them?
- Yeah.
What are they all doing here?
I don' t know.
They' re supposed to migrate to the Guatemala sound.
They won' t stay here?
No... they' il go back where they came from.
You' re different.
What do you mean?
Just the way you look.
You look different too, but in a good way.
You know, you' re kinda the same though.
Yeah?
Yeah.
And you really did it.
- Everything.
The house... it' s beautiful what you did.
Well, I promised you I would.
Great.
We got to go.
Why?
It wasn' t over for me.
I waited for you for seven years.
And now it' s too late.
I wrote you 365 letters.
- You wrote me?
- Yes.
It wasn' t over.
It still isn' t over.
You got to be kidding me.
All this time, that' s what I' d been missing?
Let' s do it again.
Wake up.
- Huh- uh.
I need food so I can regain my strength.
Okay, what do you want?
Umm... umm... some pancakes.
- Okay.
- And some chicken.
She' s the one, isn' t she?
Can I meet her?
I' d really like to meet her.
I don' t know if that' s a good idea, Martha.
So this is Martha?
Hi, I' m Allie.
I' ve heard a lot about you.
I' ve heard a lot about you, too.
You want to come in?
Are you sure?
Yeah, yeah, Noah' s just saying how hungry he was.
And, you know, you could put on a pot of tea.
Come on in.
It was nice meeting you, Martha.
- Nice meeting you too.
She' s sensational.
She really is.
I' m really glad that I came, Noah.
I' d forgotten what it' s like.
I feel like I' ve got something to look forward to.
Lon is on his way here.
I' m afraid your father spilled the beans about Noah, and when Lon didn' t hear from you again last night, he decided to come.
That' s just terrific.
You, me, Noah and Lon, one big happy family.
Tell me about the letters, Mother.
- Is it true?
- Yes.
You watched me cry myself to sleep for months and months and you never said anything.
- I' m sorry.
You' re sorry?
Because of you, my entire life is ruined!
It was wrong, but stop being dramatic and at least take some of the responsibility.
You came down here.
You knew this would happen.
Oh, so now I' m a tramp?
You are unbelievable.
Let' s take a drive.
Why would I want to go anywhere with you?
Because I might know you a little better than you think.
And I don' t want you waking up one morning thinking that if you' d known everything, you might have done something different.
What are we doing here, Mama?
Do you see that man, there?
Don' t look like it now, but 25 years ago... oh my goodness, he was really something.
We were out of our minds in love, let me tell you.
Well, naturally, your grandfather was furious, so... we decided to run away.
We didn' t even make the next town before the police picked us up.
But that was then.
You know sometimes when I' m in the area,
I just stop here and I watch him, trying to picture how different my life might have been.
I want you to know that I love your father.
- No, goddamn it, this is important and you need to hear it.
He is good to me and I don' t deserve him.
I love him, Allie, I do, I love him.
I know.
Oh, this is just very embarrassing.
Oh, I' m a stupid woman.
Look at me, the big old bawl- bag.
It' s crazy.
I don' t even know who that person is.
Oh, boy.
Here.
I hope you make the right choice.
Interesting morning?
Yeah.
Lon' s here in town.
He' s here?
Yeah, we saw his car on the way, at the hotel.
I see you got my letters.
Finally.
What are you going to do, Al?
I don' t know.
We' re back to that?
Are we back there?
They happened, you know?
I know that they happened, and they were wonderful, but they were also very irresponsible.
I have a fiance waiting for me at a hotel, who' s going to be crushed
- So you make love to me and then you go back to your husband?
Was that your plan?
Was that a test that I didn' t pass?!
No, I made a promise to a man, he gave me a ring and I gave him my word.
- I don' t...
I' il find out when I talk to him.
This is not about keeping your promise, and it' s not about following your heart, it' s about security.
- What is that supposed to mean?
- He' s got a lot of money.
- Now I hate you, you smug bastard.
- You wou...
- Have you been paying attention to anything that' s happening?
I guess not.
I think I must have misread
- I guess you did.
You' re bored and you know it.
You wouldn' t be here if there wasn' t something missing.
You arrogant son of a bitch!
Would you just stay with me?
Stay with you?
- Look at us, we' re already fighting.
We fight.
You tell me when I' m being an arrogant son of a bitch and I tell you when you' re being a pain in the ass.
Which you are 99% of the time.
I' m not afraid to hurt your feelings.
They have like a two second rebound rate and you' re back doing the next pain- in- the- ass thing.
So, what?
It' s gonna be really hard.
And we' re gonna have to work at this every day, but I want to do that, because I want you.
I want all of you, forever, you and me, every day.
Will you do something for me?
Will you just picture your life for me?
30 years from now, 40 years from now, what' s it look like?
I lost you once, I think I could do it again, if I thought it' s what you really wanted.
What easy way?
There is no easy way, no matter what I do, somebody gets hurt.
Would you stop thinking about what everyone wants.
Stop thinking about what I want, what he wants, what your parents want.
What do you want?
- What do you want?
- What do you want?
Goddamn it, what do you want?
I have to go.
My dearest Allie,
I couldn' t sleep last night because I know that it' s over between us.
I' m not bitter anymore, because I know that what we had was real.
learning from each other and growing in love.
The best love is the kind that awakens the soul and makes us reach for more, that plants a fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds.
And that' s what you' ve given me.
That' s what I' d hoped to give to you forever.
I love you.
I' il be seeing you, Noah.
It' s a beautiful story.
Yes, it is.
I don' t know why, but it makes me feel sad.
I know you feel lost right now, but don' t worry, nothing is ever lost, nor can be lost.
Shall duly flame again.
Did you write that?
No, that was Walt Whitman.
I think I knew him.
I think you did.
I' m feeling a little chilly.
Okay.
Well, who did all of this?
I did, with a little help from my friends on the nursing staff.
I' ve never seen anything so beautiful.
Neither have I.
Shall we?
- Some grape juice?
- I' d love it.
Ah, so many pills.
How sick are you?
The sickness has become a relative term for me.
I think of it now as more a general wearing out process.
To you.
So what happened?
In the story, which one did she choose?
Okay, the way I see it, I got three choices.
One, I can shoot him.
Two, I can kick the crap out of him.
I leave you.
Well, all that' s no good.
You see, 'cause... none of those options get me you.
I love you.
I love you too.
I did too.
I did too.
It' s just that when I' m... when I' m with Noah I feel like one person and when I' m with you I feel like someone totally different.
Look, it' s normal not to forget your first love.
I love you, Allie, but I want you for myself.
I don' t want to have to convince my fiance that she should be with me.
You don' t have to.
I already know I should be with you.
Who?
Who did?
Oh yes, of course.
I remember now.
It was us.
- Oh, my darling.
Oh my sweetheart.
Oh, my baby.
Noah, Noah.
I love you, Angel.
- What happened to me?
- Nothing.
You just went away for a little while.
- How much time do we have?
- I' m not sure.
Last time it was no more than five minutes.
Hey, I brought along an old friend.
- How are the children?
- Oh, they' re fine.
Now, they were here today...
Little Noah, Davanee too.
They' re getting so big.... carousel, the chestnut trees - Oh, boy.
- How fast the time goes.
It flies right on by.
Oh yes, it does.
Will you tell them I love them?
- That' s light and gay - Of course I will.
Think of you that way
- I' il find you
Remember that story you were reading to me?
Why, yes.
Do you think that I could be her tonight?
Would that be all right?
You know what we could do?
Maybe we could get a car and we could go for a ride.
Why could get out of here and just go someplace, you want to?
I don' t think so.
Not tonight, darling.
Come on, why not?
Wait a minute... why did you call me darling?
Allie, sweetheart.
Hey, Allie, I love you, stay with me, don' t leave...
No!
- Who are you?
- I' m Noah, I' m Noah and you' re Allie.
What do you want?
- Come on, baby.
- Don' t come near me!
Allie, I...
Calm down, Allie!
It' s all right, sugar, come on.
- Now calm down.
Talk to me.
- Somebody help me!
- Calm down, Allie, yes.
Let' s take a look.
- Good.
She' s fine.
And when the night is new...
I' il be looking at the moon
Morning, Mr. Calhoun.
Call Dr. Von Pettit and USC, okay?
I' ve got no BP, I got no pulse.
Let them know we are in full arrest.
Call me on my cell.
We talked about this.
It' s all right now.
Okay, yes, come on, let' s go.
It' s okay, baby, come on.
You know Mr. Holmes.
Welcome back.
- How do you feel?
Fit as a fiddle.
- Where you going?
- I was just taking a walk.
Well, you know you' re not supposed to, it' s against the rules.
Yeah, I know.
You were going to see Miss Allie.
I just got out of the hospital and I miss her.
I' m sorry, but I can' t let you see her tonight.
Now you' re gonna have to go back to your room.
I' m gonna go downstairs and get myself a cup of coffee.
I won' t be back to check on you for a while, so don' t do anything foolish.
Hi.
Hi, sweetheart.
I' m sorry I haven' t been able to be here to read to you.
I didn' t know what to do.
I was afraid you were never coming back.
I' il always come back.
What' s gonna happen when I can' t remember anything any more?
What will you do?
I' il be here.
I' il never leave you.
I need to ask you something.
What is it, sweetheart?
Do you think that our love can create miracles?
Yes, I do.
That' s what brings you back to me each time.
Do you think our love could take us away together?
I think our love can do anything we want it to.
I love you.
I love you, Allie.
Good night.
Good night.
I' il be seeing you.
The Soviets' base "the Bird" must be beaten.
It' s a formidable base but I have faith in you and Lieutenant Järv.
I want a prisoner, alive.
Good luck.
We' il dig forward.
I don' t know where the guards are.
No movement above the snow!
Welcome.
Harry Järv' s home, Stockholm December 6th, 2003
So you' re Jeanette?
- Jeanette Eriksson.
Orvar Nilsson.
We' re off to the Finnish embassy.
It' s their Independence Day.
Orvar helped us in the Winter and Continuation Wars.
That was a long time ago.
- Come in.
This is a Soviet war map.
Is it a spoil of war, Harry?
In summer of 1941 we took back the Karelian peninsula.
As you can see, the Syväri river flows from Lake Onega - towards Lake Ladoga.
During the war there were two Swedish speaking regiments.
I arrived at the base "the Dam" - in early June 1942.
The front was quiet.
We had to get information about the enemy' s intentions - with reconnaissance missions.
This clay is hard like cement!
Help is coming.
Forss, you got a package.
Take cover!
Fire in the hole!
There' s Major Hedengren.
You' ve made a lot of progress.
- TNT helps the digging.
Where the hell did you get it?
We shouldn' t waste our supplies!
We took it from the Soviets' mine fields.
Very well then.
That Swede listens to reason.
You' re married to your camera.
Do you sleep with it?
- I don' t use it in my sleep.
Next week I' il take it with me to "the Boil."
Can I come along?
- Sure.
We' il give that base hell.
The commanders don' t like it so close to our lines.
"The Boil" is almost next to the "Teeri" base.
Why were we chosen?
- I' ve been there before.
What' s that?
- An old boot leg.
I' il carry the camera with it.
At "Boil" we have our hands full.
We' il split into small groups and attack all the posts simultaneously.
Our artillery will provide cover fire for one minute.
Follow me.
We' il need a lot of grenades and charges.
Forss, Händig, Bergroth.
Take a photo of me leaving.
Now!
Is everybody here?
No wounded?
Something' s wrong.
Where are those damn Russkies?
It' s too quiet!
Russkies!
We' il bring the wounded.
We destroyed nine of the ten posts.
- Good.
The last one remained.
The Russkies struck back.
They have about thirty casualties.
Two of us were slightly wounded.
Well done!
You' il get an extra leave.
Give me a list tomorrow.
You call this a pot?
You won' t win the war with toys.
It would' ve been worse if Forss hadn' t seen the Russkies.
I had no idea what happened further back.
Our artillery didn' t know the Russkies were so close.
You started the attack before the last grenades fell.
The last grenades came too late.
I don' t know what went wrong.
Watches were synchronised.
We were very lucky.
But do we need artillery support?
- What do you mean?
We could sneak into their positions instead of attacking.
Then the battle would be fought on our terms.
Sounds unusual and nerve- racking but it' s worth a try.
The risk of exposure diminishes if the group is smaller.
Not a bad idea, Allan.
Hedengren talked about furlough.
That' d be nice.
That Swede is OK.
It' s bold to come here voluntarily from safe Sweden.
There should be more than Händig and Hedengren.
Our neighbour, IR 13, has an entire company, 140 men.
Volunteers, yes.
But the official view of Sweden...
There' ve been signs.
A friend of mine from Helsinki is in the 11th Division.
He told me what he saw last year - at Säämäjärvi.
Your Royal Highness.
This road - goes to Lake Onega and Petroskoi.
A 100 kilometres away.
"Your Royal Highness", he said.
A prince.
He dares to come this close to the line.
What' s he doing here?
You can ask someone else.
But he' s well- informed.
I heard him talking to Colonel.
He had a hard time answering all the questions.
And that prince is no sissy.
He wanted to volunteer for the Winter War - but his grandfather, the king, wouldn' t let him.
That' s understandable.
But he did let the prince come here.
You remember that?
In March.
It was reported in the newspapers.
March 1942 of the brave Finns and you, Field Marshal.
To show our appreciation my grandfather -
His Majesty King Gustaf, stows upon you a knighthood - and a First Class grand cross.
The Finnish people have never wanted war.
But neither did we hesitate to take arms to defend our country.
The Swedish royal family knows that we weren' t born yesterday.
Mannerheim said that this is Finland' s war.
Hitler was furious.
We happen to have the same enemy.
The Winter War was worse.
We fought the Russkies and Germans.
When Mannerheim turned 75 Hitler paid him a visit.
Mannerheim, who is a lot taller than Hitler - marching fast.
Quiet.
Thirty enemy soldiers were killed...
That' s you.
Järv' s patrol made the news.
Tomorrow I' il go to officer training.
Us young officers are too lenient with you rascals.
It' il change when I come back.
- OK, sir!
Shut your pie hole!
Is it any good?
You finally came back.
- Did you do well in the training?
You have a little tan.
- Nothing' s changed here.
What was the training like?
- What I expected.
What the hell...?
Hi, Harry!
What was the training like?
Was it bad?
Whose are these?
- That' s mine.
There are other guns in similar condition.
Commanders pressure subordinates and me too and you just lie here!
I' m gone for two weeks and everything is a mess!
Like in peacetime.
But we didn' t give a damn.
No one has to be toady to me.
But the Russkies may come any time so the guns have to be ready!
Inspection in ten minutes.
Slobs get extra guard duty.
Frilund too!
This happens if you' re not diligent.
We proceeded undetected into enemy territory - and acted fast.
We dominated the battle the whole time.
This is routine.
- But now we have a prisoner.
I heard that you asked when they want the prisoner.
"Saturday at the latest!"
We fulfilled our mission and took a prisoner.
There were no casualties.
Thanks, Harry.
Well done.
You' ve done almost thirty missions.
This one went well too.
They' ve mostly been recon missions.
Nine or ten would be enough.
We could discreetly attack the enemy bases.
I heard that!
Infantry Regiments 61 and 1061?
You see!
They outnumber us by a thousand.
We' il do fine.
Everything OK?
- It' s peaceful.
My shift ends in thirty minutes...
Help me!
Here I am again.
- Good.
You came back.
- You got a package.
I found something in Vaasa.
Did you have fun?
Hi, guys!
Greetings from Vaasa.
How' s it going?
Well...
Franzén got killed.
A sniper shot him in the mouth when he was on guard duty.
Franzén too...
Järv brought a new pot.
We have to take care of that sniper.
I talked with our headmaster in Vaasa.
He said we should use our "free time" for educating ourselves.
He thought of us?
Ragnar Krook is a fine man.
He suggested correspondence courses.
He' il test you later.
I' il be your instructor.
We don' t have enough lamp oil for reading at night.
Wait.
The Russkies left a lot of phone cable behind.
Look at this.
Look at that.
Not bad.
Just don' t burn the dug- out.
It' s been peaceful.
I' il get some sleep.
Get up, guys!
Our country is calling for your services!
The coffee substitute is ready!
- Shut your pie hole, Forss.
Gimme your mess kit, you' il wake up.
Cat pee?
Don' t swear so much.
It' s nasty.
Everything' s getting worse.
Don' t drink that shit.
It' s better to have tea.
- Yes.
Stop!
Password!
- Twigs.
Correct.
I' m reverend Högström.
I wanted to meet you soldiers at "the Dam".
- Thank you.
Good evening.
How' s it going in here?
Nothing new.
Please, sit.
Kaustinen!
Make some substitute for the reverend.
A lot of grounds here.
A foot cloth!
No wonder it' s tasted like shit all week.
Here you are, reverend.
I' ve visited many bases but none like this.
You' ve worked hard with the trenches, dug- outs and forts.
This looks really great.
- The russkies won' t get through easily.
But soldiers also need free time.
Nobody can take this for too long.
- They need some counterbalance.
Some of the guys and I read and study.
Söderman is studying for his A levels.
I' d go crazy without books.
You' re studying in these circumstances?
- Yes, reverend.
Järv arranged it with our headmaster.
Some don' t care for culture.
They sleep whenever they can.
Young man, you have a fine camaraderie here.
Good luck to you all.
I hope the Lord protects you.
Thank you for the refreshments.
- Thank you for coming.
What does this word, "danger", mean?
It means jeopardy.
If it' s really dangerous you can say "peril".
The British have a lot of words.
Odd.
- Looking them up?
What a joke.
Soon only Brazil will not be at war against us.
But the gentlemanly British...
- It' s understandable.
They fight against the Germans and we threaten their supply lines.
Bertel, I' il read you an excerpt of English at its best.
That' s "peril" for you.
What did it mean?
- Something like this.
- Sounds wonderful.
Who said that?
- Guess.
Our "enemy" Churchill.
We both know that we still fight - against the same enemy.
Some old veterans are allowed to go to home.
But even you new guys should take guard duty seriously.
The Russkies are close so be watchful.
How close, sir?
- You don' t have to call me that here.
Their defensive perimeter runs behind that hill.
It was relatively quiet - but now they' re hitting us with 60 grenades a day, at noon.
What do we do then?
- Take cover in the dug- out.
The guards remain at their posts.
Don' t show yourself needlessly.
Many men have died here.
Their snipers are good at what they do.
Someone' s coming.
- The platoon' s second- in- command Forss.
He' il take a last look, he' s going to officers' school.
- It' s time.
I guess there' s not much to say.
Thanks for everything.
- Thanks, Lasse.
I' m happy for you but I know what I' m losing.
We both know it.
I hope you can take care of that sniper.
He' s killed far too many.
- Trust me.
We' il deal with that bastard.
- Hang tight.
Hang tight, boys!
You should stop smoking.
It' s bad for your health.
You just watch for the flying lead.
Nicotine is my problem!
That was today' s lesson.
I' il go to see Marttinen.
I won' t be long.
I' m sorry, you looked like Döbeln first.
It' s nothing.
- I heard about it.
- More than enough.
Ten men is enough.
Good.
OK, boys.
I promised Marttinen you' d come along.
We' il leave at 1830 hours.
Helén leads one group, Nordman the other.
We can trust them.
Even the battalion commander got involved.
Guess what I was ordered?
Only I can have a submachine gun, the rest get rifles.
"We can' t afford to lose ten submachine guns." - Asshole!
A submachine gun and three hand grenades for everyone.
Frände, make sure we have piled- up charges.
I know where to put one.
Up the Major' s ass!
You won' t see him there.
But Lieutenant Colonel Marttinen seems to like it there.
Form a row, I' il take a picture.
Where' s Backholm?
- Sleeping.
Let him sleep.
It' s going to be a rough night.
Björk, move closer so everybody fits in the photo.
There' s a guard ahead.
Let' s go right.
There' s a guard too.
Let' s try the middle.
It' s past midnight.
- We' ve been here for five hours.
It can' t be helped.
My leg has frostbite.
- No, go back.
Let the medic take care of it.
There' s a machine gun here.
You' il secure the rear.
Finholm, Fagerström, Frände, come with me.
There it is!
It' s unmanned - That' s the way they are.
Let' s blow it up.
That was a stove hatch.
Now we know where they are.
The Russkies are on the left.
Stay here to cover us.
That' s the main dug- out.
Lieutenant, fire artillery barrage.
Goddamn assholes!
Grenades!
Don' t be afraid!
Reinforcements may be on the way.
Grenades here!
Greetings to Mannerheim!
I' il show you, bandits!
You' re gonna get it!
More Russkies!
They won' t surrender.
We' re about ready, is everyone here?
You OK?
- A few pieces of shrapnels in my leg.
- Good.
Let' s go or the whole Red Army will be on our tail.
Tough Russkies, nobody surrendered.
Take him with you.
Stretcher!
He was hit in the lungs.
You got lucky, Ragnar.
We' il see you soon.
Hey, Järv.
Aren' t you ever afraid?
I' m sometimes really afraid.
- Of course I' m afraid.
No normal 20- year- old wants to die.
In battle I feel a knot in my stomach.
It' s not paralysing fear but adrenaline surging into my brain.
It makes me 100% effective.
But some react differently.
They freeze or run away scared.
Fear must be controlled.
You know how.
Otherwise I wouldn' t take you with me.
Of course I' m sometimes afraid.
But not as much when Järv is with us.
Here they come!
His name is Nikolai Smirnov.
Take him to the first- aid station quickly.
If he stays alive.
We' il go to the dug- out.
Wait.
We carried him and now he' s dead.
- It wasn' t exactly his fault.
Let' s take him inside.
They can bury him.
Klas...
Strange.
Smirnov shot me in the lungs four months ago.
Now he' s dead.
- And you' re very much alive!
Do you hear?
The Russkies' time signal is as punctual as...
Ragnar!
Is anyone else wounded?
How did they hit such a small hole?
Stretchers.
I' il immortalise one corner of our great dwelling.
Stay there so the photo looks more life- like.
Sit at the end of the table, Kaustinen.
Try to look like you' re learning something.
Söderman, sit and look into the camera.
You can show your girl what good conditions you have here.
I' m not in the mood today.
Don' t move.
Why are you sulking on such a beautiful day?
The girl I told you about the other day...
I got a letter from her.
She' s not my girl.
Did she break it off?
- It didn' t even start.
Let' s leave him alone.
I' m sorry.
We' re on time.
Who knows?
Soon we' il find out.
- At ease!
- I' m not asking that.
We have a lot of work ahead of us.
- True.
Marttinen is breathing down our necks.
- You know why?
He wants us to be battle ready.
Indeed.
He won' t let us become lazy.
It' s good for morale.
But it means casualties.
- Exactly.
He doesn' t think the price is too high.
"The Dam", Järv.
- Taxell here.
Marttinen wants you to recon a Russian base next to 2nd battalion.
And a prisoner.
Will you do it?
- OK.
It must be planned well.
I want details of their defences.
I' il speak to my colleagues.
- I' il get back to you.
Over.
Can I come along?
- Sure.
We work well together.
I' il come along.
Yes?
- Can I come along?
Can I come along?
- Welcome.
This' il be a good strike group.
Seven men is enough.
We' il go to 2nd battalion to get to know the situation.
Just a few hours left...
Don' t worry, Bertel.
It' il go well, you' il see.
Damn bedbugs!
What are you reading?
Show me.
- History of philosophy.
You' ve read it thoroughly.
- It' s a good book.
Socrates.
Plato.
I want to read this.
- Of course.
Plato is overrated.
A metaphysicist and a speculative philosopher.
Quit lecturing and turn off the light.
We want to sleep.
- Soon.
In Plato' s model society individuals had no rights.
The role of literature was to idolise the powers that be.
Plato' s society has now come to pass with Stalin and Hitler.
Really?
We weren' t taught that.
Aristotle is much better.
His thinking is based on reality.
But he did make mistakes.
He said - that Nordic people are brave in war but dumb in the head.
That' s his opinion of us.
Now we should sleep.
- lf it' s possible.
The battle begins here.
Järv and his men go in, Major Tirronen fires the artillery.
Thank you, Lieutenant Mangs.
You know your mission.
I want a prisoner.
Your other task is to crush the base "Sea".
I' m counting on you to do your best.
I' il be around until the mission is over.
Let' s take a picture.
Did you notice that Söderman has grown ten centimetres?
Laugh all you want.
Napoleon was small and a corporal too.
We can' t go forward.
- Let' s try another way.
This is a good spot.
Take a break.
It' s too quiet.
It' s three o' clock already.
We have to wait for the evening breeze.
Helén, Finholm.
- I came at once.
What now?
Someone was standing there!
There!
No one' s there.
Calm down.
There is!
I saw a face!
- You saw a ghost.
He' s nervous.
Damn, they don' t believe me!
What' s the time?
Three on the dot.
- Mission began 18 hours ago.
I guess I dare to smoke one.
Or do I?
Not moving for four hours and thinking of smoking was hard.
Damn!
I have to quit this.
When we beat "the Sea" I' il smoke no more!
I promise.
Get up, boys.
Time to get busy.
Harry!
Söderman!
No...
Järv, I' m hit!
- Leave if you can!
Boys!
Kaustinen and I are wounded!
Can you make it?
- Yes, I can.
Allan, grenade!
Can you make it?
You understand?
Walk to the first- aid station.
Östman!
That way.
No prisoner this day either.
Yeah.
We have casualties: one dead and seven wounded.
"The Sea" was destroyed but we have no prisoner.
The Russkies fought hard.
About thirty of them were killed.
No one has died for me before.
And Söderman of all people...
He sacrificed himself for me.
The law of war is hard.
Mangs, take a picture of Helén and me.
Press there.
That' s Söderman' s box.
The small one.
Listen to what Söderman wrote.
"If I get killed, I want to die like a Finnish soldier."
And he did.
"Corporal Bertel Söderman."
"Rest in peace.
Your friends at the front. "
Dear friends and family of Bertel Söderman.
My talented young student had his whole life ahead of him.
But destiny decided otherwise.
Even in grim circumstances Bertel remained humane.
And he was also a brave soldier.
There is no greater sacrifice - than giving his life for his comrades.
Now we' il carry his memory with us - which is as bright as the marble in the ballroom of the school.
His name will be engraved in it - where it will shine for the following generations.
I' ve lost so many great boys.
I don' t know.
I' ve enquired about degree requirements from the university.
You' ve always been interested in everything.
Good luck, my friend.
- Thank you, headmaster.
You know your mission.
Take a prisoner and recon in the Russkie hinterland.
Good luck.
Strike groups!
Mines!
We' il stop here.
Lindblad, go further back with Olof and Kanckos.
We' il try capturing a lone Russkie.
It must be done in silence.
Capturing many is too risky.
We' re too far behind the lines.
Let them go.
We would have to fire.
Look at those clothes.
Next time someone says that Russkies have bad uniforms, I' il beat them!
No more Russkies, I guess.
Let' s go home and continue tomorrow.
Harry!
Don' t move!
It' s clear now.
Ufa!
You must leave me here.
Go on!
There' s no point in you staying here!
Järv hit a mine.
Dammit, boys!
We can' t leave him even if he ordered us.
I' m going back.
I hadn' t read yet.
I thought of all the pretty girls I' d never get to see...
And I felt that it was unreasonable - to die at the age of 22.
I ordered you to go.
You told us about the Three Musketeers.
"One for all and all for one."
How are you?
Can you walk?
We' il take Järv.
And Nordström.
Switch!
How are you, Lindblad?
- Just a flesh wound.
I can help you.
Klockars!
Check if they need help.
Does anyone know their blood type?
- Good.
You' il donate blood.
How are you, Lindblad?
Nothing serious?
I' il be OK soon.
- Good.
I need men like you.
Sit down.
Giving blood is no easy task.
I feel dizzy.
- How is Järv?
He came to after three bottles of plasma.
And a hefty dose of my blood.
You can be proud, corporal.
I spent a long time at the hospital.
The wound didn' t heal and had to be operated on many times.
St Göran' s hospital, May 1944
You got mail.
From my regiment commander.
He still remembers me.
It' s been nine months already.
How are you feeling?
Soon you' il walk with a prosthetic limb.
We' il transfer you to Salsta castle.
Baroness Wera von Essen has set up a convalescence home - for Finnish soldiers.
Reconnaissance division June 7th, 1944, Stockholm
I' d like to speak to Engineer Lieutenant Nils- Erik Stenbäck.
Stenbäck.
Hi, Nils- Erik.
It' s Curt Wennberg.
HQ' s reconnaissance division, Mikkeli
How are you?
- I' il speak candidly.
What the devil are you doing?
The Russkies have 24 divisions ready for attack.
Cannons and tanks side by side.
And more motorised units are coming.
The attack may start at anytime - and you' re not even practising!
I just wanted to warn you.
Not exactly good news, Curt.
A lot.
Sounds horrible.
It' s the real deal in Karelia now.
Believe me, boys.
61 is heading west soon.
You almost hope for it.
What the hell are we doing here if Helsinki is under threat?
Vyborg fell suddenly on June 20th which caused a threat.
If Russkies had crossed the strait they would' ve gotten to Helsinki.
IR 61 was ordered to assume command of Tienhaara.
Marttinen understood what was at stake.
He told his men over and over again - that Tienhaara was Finland' s lock.
And he was determined to keep it locked.
We' re getting close.
We' il arrive in about thirty minutes.
The company will march to Tienhaara.
Expect artillery and aerial attacks.
The boys shouldn' t march in too tight a formation.
Look at this map.
You' re very kind, baroness.
- You' ve deserved your coffee.
Go ahead.
Cream and sugar?
Here is the news.
The Soviet Union has launched a major offensive in Karelia.
The Finnish posts were heavily bombarded yesterday.
And the bombardment intensified this morning.
Soviet forces have broken through Finnish defences - and forced the Finns to withdraw.
In Normandy, the Allied forces have strengthened...
It' s time for me to go back.
Are you going to the front with that leg?
Perhaps.
And it' s driving me crazy!
My place is at the front.
Excuse me...
Don' t think I' m not grateful to you and Sweden.
- Of course not.
Wessberg.
What the hell?
They' re going the wrong way.
Shut up, boys!
Don' t mind us.
Who knows what hell they' ve been through.
Let' s get to it.
Like Marttinen said, sweat spares blood.
You must be able to shoot to those bridges.
Sir!
- Any casualties?
Five killed and 58 wounded.
OK.
How' s your munitions?
The times are hard but Marttinen has it under control.
We' il be OK.
What is it, Harry?
Can' t you get any sleep?
Are you thinking of our comrades?
It' s horrible to lie here, I should be there with them.
We' il come to get you.
Are there any more wounded?
- Are you nuts?
Get down!
Who' s going to take care of them now?
Unis.
Nyström is out of the game.
You' il take command of the platoon.
I' il take command of the company after Captain Joffs.
Major Holmberg says that all 1st company commanders are wounded.
Pikulinsky, Holmström and Hjort.
The 11th company was under concentrated artillery fire.
Joffs and Nyström are both out.
Löfman assumed command and Unis took over Nyström' s platoon.
They' ve lost 27 men, only six are left.
Wessberg!
If the situation cools, we leave.
We' re not staying here to die.
Here they come!
They' ve had enough for now.
But they' il be back!
Can Tienhaara hold - if it sounds like this 120 kilometres away?
The 3rd battalion commander says - that the Russkies have broken through at Kivisilta.
Thank you.
You can go back.
But on separate routes.
- Yes, sir.
Sir, an order from the commander.
Listen, boys!
"One or two platoons have broken through at Kivisilta."
"They must be stopped.
Use assault guns in counterattack. "
"An energetic officer must lead it to make it work."
Reserves must be used without compunction. "
"Marttinen."
Löfman, you' il strike back with the 11th company.
Our artillery and two assault guns will lay down cover fire.
Good luck.
11th company, follow me!
Platoon commanders and group leaders here!
To the bridge!
At any cost!
We could use Järv now.
- No kidding.
They' re here!
They' re not here anymore.
My weapon...
And Löfman?
- He' s dead.
Soldiers!
It' s been a tough day.
We will never see many of our comrades again.
And even more were wounded.
But I' m very proud of you.
Our commander- in- chief Field Marshal Mannerheim - personally asked me to thank you, men of IR 61.
Because of you he promoted me to Colonel.
No Russkies who came here remained alive.
You also, Lieutenant Lillandt, have been promoted.
Congratulations, Captain.
Remember what I said, boys!
Tienhaara is Finland' s lock.
The Marshal relies on us!
What did he want?
- Nothing special.
He gave a speech to the boys.
During the days and weeks in Tienhaara -
IR 61 lost 820 men.
But the Finnish lock and the road to Helsinki remained closed.
A few weeks after that -
Finland' s independence was at stake every day.
... a group of youths from "Reclaim the Streets" congregated...
It is actually a joy to be a Swede today.
L" m deeply disappointed and angry.
It" s an attack against individuals and democracy itself.
Hi.
Hi.
Get dressed.
My bus to the airport leaves in 20 minutes.
What" s the big deal with India?
Come on.
Get dressed.
We" ve got to go.
- Did you call to say we" re coming?
- What?
- It didn" t work out.
Where are you going to live?
You know I have to go.
- You have to?
- What do you think.
I don" t get your stress.
What do you mean?
Lt" s the same for both of us.
- You" re going to India!
- I work for my money, so I can go.
It" s not the same thing.
L" m on my way.
Do you have room for Maja this summer?
Come on, l" m going to India.
That" s okay, I understand.
Yeah, same to you.
Meaning?
I don" t feel like wearing sweatpants and living in the projects again.
- What do you mean?
- Just what I said.
Hi, it" s Olle.
L" m on my way to India.
Yes, it" s true.
Can you have a girl living with you?
Maja.
She" s damned nice.
You do?
Damn, you" re awesome.
You rule.
What number is it?
Door code 1230.
Say hi to everyone.
Peace, bye.
He" s so fucked up.
But it" s cool, you can live there.
Mattias is the guy you" il be living with.
- Can" t you take the next bus?
- No, I want to take this one.
Maja...
I can help you with your bags.
Everything will be fine, I promise.
Now we can finally make out.
You may have to find someone else to make out with.
- So, tell me it looks good.
- Too bad your teeth are still off.
My teeth have to be crooked to match your overbite.
If I look better than you, no one will believe we" re best friends.
- I don" t have an overbite.
- Look at your reflection.
- It" s natural and cute.
- This is cute, too.
I have nothing, no goal in life.
- Olle" s cock is tiny, anyway.
- I don" t care, it was a cock.
That" s cool, right?
Yeah, it feels like I won first prize in a raffle.
We" re just going to hang, and nothing is going to happen.
- Can we see your ticket, please?
L" m moving, so I forgot to buy one.
I mean, I usually have one, but...
- 538046, running a check.
Don" t you have a ticket?
- Can you show me your ID?
- I don" t have an ID.
- Can" t you just be nice?
Let" s go.
- Excuse me, let me go.
No, l" m not waiting.
You can" t hold on to me.
- Let me go!
- Damned kid!
- You little whore!
- L" m not a whore, damn it!
Your mother is a whore!
You want to go with me to the dentist?
L" m going to my new home... or something.
- Will it piss you off if I go?
Are you sure?
You should buy yourself a travel card, or something.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Hello.
- Hi!
So, you" re Maja?
- L" m Mattias.
- Hello.
- It" s good.
L" il take them.
Come in.
- John and Anders.
Didn" t we meet when I came from India?
L" d been to see a yogi.
Cut it out.
- He" s always bragging about his trip to India.
Let me show you your room.
She came here because her boyfriend went to India, you idiot.
- Okay.
And you can put your stuff here, if that" s okay with you.
I mean, of course it" s fine.
- Oh, good.
I don" t mean you having nowhere to live, but...
In the hall, there" s a closet for your clothes.
If you want.
But things do disappear out there.
We call it The Black Hole.
Somewhere out in space there like this huge...
What do you call it?... a big mountain of everyone" s old socks.
L" m sorry.
It" s just very funny.
- L" m sorry.
- Are you okay?
I mean if you" re sad.
L" m actually more tired of it.
L" ve moved five times this year.
If you can handle it.
As long as you don" t beat and abuse us.
- Where is the bathroom?
Sorry, don" t put your girly stuff out visibly.
- What do you mean?
- You know, girly- girly stuff.
Is there any toilet paper?
You can use the phone book on the floor.
Hey there.
I stepped on some damned plate.
- What are you doing?
- Are you living In Mattias" s kitchen?
- That" s my lighter!
- Yeah, right.
Gimme the lighter, l" ve been looking for it all night.
- L" m trying to sleep here!
- There" s a woman sleeping here.
- So, what do you do?
- How about yourself?
Do you have like, a boyfriend, or something?
- L" m talking to Maja here.
Oh, yeah.
Olle, right.
- So, how" s that?
Are you throwing macaroni at me?
- Sorry.
You want a cigarette?
- L" ve brushed my teeth.
Actually, I can take a drag.
- Did you have fun?
- Yes.
We met some girls I got to know in Gothenburg.
- Have you lived in Gothenburg?
I was there for the demonstrations.
Fun?
- It was alright.
We rented a bus, went down there and it was cool at first.
What I wanted to say was that the girls we just met...... may be coming here.
- Right now?
Great.
That" s going to be lots of fun.
Really.
Bye now.
- You forgot your cigarettes.
- Oh, right.
- And your lighter.
- Cool.
L" il close the door here.
L" il turn off the light.
Damn, did you bake these?
This shit just isn" t going to work.
Maybe I can live with you instead?
You don" t get it, Paulie.
Why not?
Yeah, l" il be there, and then we can talk some more.
Okay, l" il see you soon.
- Why the hell are you here?
- I came by to see you.
- You can" t just move in.
- But can I come in?
- With your stuff?
Come on, my parents could be home at any time.
- No.
- You don" t have to say we" re dating.
- You don" t get it, Paulie.
- They could come at any time.
- Lf I tell you no...
- But I can" t live there!
Could you hurry up?
I knew it, you little rat.
You" ve stolen tons of toilet paper.
You" ve got loads of it.
- Why are you stealing?
- You could ask!
- No?
Well, pardon me.
Wipe your ass forever.
- I don" t need that many.
- You retard!
- I think your mom will notice.
- Just be nice to her.
- Where are you girls going?
- We" re just getting ready to leave.
- Aren" t we having tea?
Seriously.
- Paulina, why are you...
- Oh, just cut it out.
You have such a nice home.
I could move in here.
I don" t know what you mean.
- Are you in town for the summer?
- But I have nowhere to live.
- She" s staying with a friend.
Paulina told me you live with your boyfriend.
I used to, but he left town.
- And the apartment wasn" t his, so...
- So, now you have no place to live.
Aren" t you thinking of buying an apartment?
- Lf I had the money, I guess I could.
- Not everyone has money.
- Riding camp?
- It" s a family tradition.
- Yes, you are going!
Don" t save any food for me.
L" il eat out.
Don" t you think it" d be better...... if you at least tried to find somewhere else to live.
You can" t live with a bunch of 24- year- old guys.
With their morning erections, and stuff.
I really don" t mind morning erections.
But it" s hard to be a girl.
Know what I mean?
No.
I haven" t felt that before, it" s really weird.
- How do you mean?
- I can" t explain it.
- It" s just a feeling, a new one.
- So, you want to be a guy?
No, but l" d much rather be living in a better world.
- So you can just wait for Olle.
He" s going to call...
Nope... on Sunday.
- I just mean, what if he" s the one.
- There" s no such thing.
Just "the one right now".
- Yeah, the stupid "English Patient".
- It" s no good?
- Have you seen it?
But you" il get great muscle tone from riding a pony all damned day.
And you can drag your cart and bags.
Here" s the deal with Olle.
He had a destination.
He" d do things.
- So, this is where you "live".
- Hey, are you listening?
So, where do you keep your clothes?
Maybe l" m the same way, and should be doing stuff.
You know, travel, find myself...
There" s bread on your bed.
Mattias made it.
He baked for you?
On his own?
And it says "Maja"?
- What" s this?
- Where he keeps his drugs, I guess.
"His drugs, you guess"?
Here, smell his drugs.
You knew his drugs were there.
Hey, look!
Don" t touch me with that thing.
Those are some tidy guys you live with.
Hi.
- Are you moving out?
- No, it was just...
- You" re all soaked.
- L" il just change my clothes.
"You" re all soaked".
Give me some tips on getting him.
Or aren" t you going to let me?
You do whatever you want.
L" m just trying to watch the movie.
- Yeah, making tea is hard.
I can well imagine greater cuts...
- Does it bother you?
- What?
- No.
It" s okay, really.
Does it bother you?
L" m sorry about last night.
- L" m watching this.
- It" s just Babylon crap.
- What" s "Babylon"?
I don" t want to see it.
- Well, excuse me.
- Did you two have a fight?
Had you been swimming before?
No, I jumped off the bridge.
- No, it" s awesome.
- What" s going on?
Naw.
Ramiro, John, and Anders are coming.
We" re going out for beer.
- You" re coming with us.
- What, right away?
- Cool.
That" s what I call fate.
Hey, wait a second.
Wait!
When it comes to sex, I only sleep with girls.
L" m bisexual.
- You sure look surprised.
- I think that" s...
- Beautiful?
But she just denies me, every time I try.
But it" il work out some time.
- So, who is it?
She" s tough with guys, too.
l" m more open, like you, and take each day as it comes.
Like we were saying outside.
She" s much more, you know, worried.
Did you make this?
- She" s got an Indian guru, too.
- Really?
You seem like you don" t fit in here.
Not quite.
- Because you" re old.
Did you take it seriously?
I was joking.
Did you understand that I was joking?
What, are you going?
- Yes.
Maja!
Maja, wait!
Hello?
Can you wait?
- Wait, why are you going home?
- L" m not.
Now, go back to Paulie.
What are you talking about?
I really hate living with you, okay?
I need my sleep.
I can" t take being woken up by some Argentinean idiot with bad breath.
- Don" t laugh at me, damn it!
- I think you" re...
- Being difficult?
Fine by me.
- No, you are.
- Is there a problem?
- He" s a huge problem.
Why are you saying...
- Stay out of this!
- I told you to stay out of this!
- You" re completely nuts!
What the hell are you doing?
- Are you hurt?
- Just cut it out.
Get out of the way.
Just great!
- Don" t you start.
- Settle down.
Excuse me, you dropped your cigarettes!
- Where are you going?
- L" m going home.
- Home to Hornstull.
That" s where l" m going, too.
How about sharing a cab?
Yeah, go get your cab.
Excuse me, girl.
I though you might want to go to my office, and...... and drink some champagne or Bailey" s.
- You want me to go to your office?
- L" m going to bed, okay?
- Okay, okay.
Sleep well.
- Do you have a cell phone?
Has something happened?
I lost my keys and need to call home.
You can call from there.
That means you have to go with me there.
- Is that okay?
- Yeah, if you pay me.
- What" s your name?
- L" m Maja.
L" m Stefan.
Good to meet you.
You want to shake hands?
So, do you want some champagne?
Hello?
Is this John?
Hi, it" s Maja.
L" m just checking if anyone" s home.
Yes, l" il be there soon.
Bye.
- Did you have any champagne?
Here" s a glass.
- Cheers.
- Thanks.
You drink real fast.
L" il go get some more.
- Cheers, again.
- Cheers.
Are we having a totally romantic date, or what?
Are you going to fuck me on your couch here?
You" d like that, right?
No, seriously, I think you" re nice.
I just want to talk a bit.
- What" s this?
- A flyer for A New Sweden.
Yeah, I can tell.
Why do you have that here?
I think they have good policies on housing.
- Are you joking?
- No, I mean it.
- Alright...
- Cheers.
Are you okay?
What are you thinking about?
See, you can smile, but you seem sad.
Cheers.
Are you sure you" re okay?
Hey, you look like you" re about to start crying.
L" m right here.
Can you just hold me?
Stop it!
- Stop!
- Wait, take it easy.
Stop.
Take it easy!
Will you stop it?
Just take it easy!
L" m sorry.
Maja.
- God damn you!
You can" t just...
- I said I was sorry.
You don" t do that!
Don" t you understand?
Look at yourself.
What a pig you are.
L" m sorry.
- Yeah, right.
I didn" t mean to do it.
- Did you sleep well?
Hi there.
Everything alright?
Are you coming?
- Are things okay?
- Everything is just fine.
- You...
Lt" s just that l" m working.
Have fun.
Are you in love with Mattias?
Why the hell would I be in love with Mattias?
L" m totally in love with you.
No, seriously.
- Did Olle call you?
- No, he didn" t call, but never mind.
If you" re not in love with Mattias you should leave him alone.
Okay...
Sounds to me like you" re damned interested in Mattias.
If Olle had been home, these weird things wouldn" t have happened
- What weird things?
- Just everything.
It just feels like everything we do or say here and now -
- is sort of important somehow.
That it will remain, be written down somehow.
- That" s him, with the office couch.
- Are you sure?
Mattias, that guy over there groped Maja.
- Him?
Yes.
He groped her!
- Go get him, guys.
- Hey, scumbag!
Hold still!
Stop, you bastard!
Stop!
- They" re crazy.
Fuck!
What the hell was that all about?
Maja!
- Hi, how are things going?
- Fine.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
Paulie told me about the guy we chased.
Don" t do stuff like that.
- I gotta go.
What" s the matter with you?
Hey!
Where is the chorizo?
Hola, Maja.
You think you" re having a pile of your own?
Before, I was thinking how we never did anything.
- Then we chased that jackoff guy.
- You just sat there.
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you, man.
Office guy is stuffing himself with pork chops for the Sweden party.
Check it out.
A New Sweden is having a youth party -
Come on.
L" m fucking starving.
- Let" s go boycott the place.
- Read it!
We" ve been here all day.
- Let" s have an adventure.
- Listen to this:
"A New Sweden" s Youth Party.
Come for a drink and food. "
- Let" s eat falafel.
- That" s the point.
- "Drink and food".
"Your country, your choice".
- Is it just me, or is this nuts?
- You don" t want to go, anyway.
- You" re not coming?
- You" re too ugly to go.
If you" re not going, neither will I.
Maja, you" re coming with us, aren" t you?
Free food.
We" il dance and eat and dance and eat.
- I know.
- Come on.
- It" s over there.
- L" il wait here.
- Come on, man.
- L" il wait here.
- L" il bring some food for you.
Come with us.
It" s a Nazi party.
You guys go, and bring me some food.
- Hello.
- Welcome.
L" m FL, Fredrik Lindberg.
- Calle.
Fredrik Lindberg.
FL.
- Paulina.
- Hello, Paulina.
Lina...
- Are you Leffe" s little sister?
- Or...?
- No.
My mistake.
Where are you from?
- Sweden.
- Which one?
- In Skärholmen.
I didn" t know there was one there.
- It" s brand new.
- We" re doing a rally soon.
Nice.
- In the main square.
We wanted to see if Nicke Gustavsson could come.
We haven" t set a date, what with being new.
L" m glad you came.
You" ve got your drinks, I see.
- And there will be food?
- Absolutely.
- L" m glad to see you.
Welcome.
Bye.
- What do you mean "square"?
- He knows l" m Polish.
- L" m not getting out of here.
- Sure you will.
- No one knows you" re Polish.
- Why didn" t Mattias come?
He" s been difficult to get going after Gothenburg.
- How come?
I think he took it hard.
- Really?
I think it" s a trauma.
Now, before dinner is served -
- we" re going to hear a speech from our leader Niklas Gustavsson.
- Damn.
- Who is it?
We aren" t against immigrants, we just think it" s gone too far -
- when Sweden can" t take care of it" s own people.
If they think we" re holding a meeting in Skärholmen...
We make them come, so maybe they realize there are good people there.
- what we think of their immigration policy.
Long, thin and blue.
But the idea sucks.
It" s does not!
- It" s totally cool.
Lt" s stupid.
That idiot Gustavsson is having an operation at my hospital.
- Seriously?
- Let" s take him.
- What do you mean?
- When he" s in recovery...... we get him.
- What do you mean, "get him"?
Kidnap him.
What do you mean, "kidnap"?
We can" t just waltz in and grab him.
You need a plan.
- Suck my dick!
- What do you mean, "kidnap"?
I know every corner of that hospital.
I can find out anything there.
What a great idea.
I love it.
- Alright, let" s do it!
Let" s do it!
- Okay!
- Lf everyone" s doing it, I guess...
Alright, buddy!
I read in a yoga book that your soul feels like your anus.
- It says your anus needs sun.
- Have you been tanning your ass?
- Fuck you!
- He" s been tanning his ass.
I haven" t tanned my ass.
We" re your friends, now humor me.
- What are you doing?
- Doing the dishes!
- You" re just scrubbing.
- L" ve been doing dishes all day long.
Where have you been?
Stop it.
Are we just going to stand here for a while?
Thanks for washing the dishes.
Are you alright?
Hey!
Maja!
Bring two burgers and come here!
Come on, Ramiro has a great plan!
Come on, Maja!
Maja!
Come on, fatso!
Come on!
- What are you doing?
What do you think?
L" m going.
- Okay, bye!
l" m coming, fatso!
- Hello.
- Where" s Mattias?
- He" s coming later, to Skärholmen.
Are you asleep?
Come on, get your shirt on.
- Cool ninja suits.
- They" re porter outfits.
Hey, if you pull down your headband and cut some holes -
- no one will recognize you.
Antonio Banderas?
I look like Antonio Banderas.
Why are you laughing?
I look like him, according to my mom.
- Or Johnny Depp.
- Hola, Johnny Depp!
- I don" t know.
You look like...
You look a bit like Ulf Lundell.
- Is this a good idea?
- Yeah, of course.
- It" s cool.
- Alright, fifteen minutes.
- Right.
Don" t do anything I wouldn" t do.
- He" s removed an anal fistula.
- I don" t give a fuck.
- What" s that?
- A death certificate.
An old lady, born 1905?
Stop asking, and just go!
- Hey there.
- What are they transporting?
- It" s someone recently deceased.
They go to the basement mortuary.
Are corpses transported like that?
- Why is she upside down?
- She was so fat, we had to.
- Is upside down a bad thing?
- They" re usually on their backs.
- This is insane.
It" s not good.
- We haven" t heard an alarm.
They" il be here soon, and then we go.
Can I take a look.
What, do you think she" il mind?
Save it for another day, or you can go with them and take a look.
We" re porters.
- Did he answer?
- No, he just denied the call.
Then there" s nothing to worry about.
- Aren" t you getting off?
- Right.
Hey!
- Stay cool.
- Did you see the guard?
They" re not looking this way, they" re just smoking.
How much longer?
- So what should we do?
- I don" t fucking know!
Screw this.
It" s kidnapping, we" il get life.
- This isn" t pot.
We" il get ten years!
- Alright, damn it!
Let" s take him back.
Stop, you bastards!
Open the car, Anders!
Open up!
Anders, we" ve got Niklas Gustavsson.
What are we going to do?
What are we doing?
- Hey, girl!
- Hi!
- That" s some chair.
- Where" s Mattias?
I don" t know.
- It" s really cool.
- Will he fit?
- It" s closed!
- No, they" re here on Wednesdays.
Didn" t you see me try the door?
- Besides, it" s Monday.
- So what, they" re closed.
- Stop arguing.
- What do you mean?
- Screw you!
- Will you stop it?
- Is there anywhere else?
- L" m thinking.
- Take him out to Alby, or something.
- How about your house?
Yeah, I live up there.
My parents wont recognize him.
- Who are we going to say it is?
This won" t work.
Let" s hide him and then think up something smart.
Right, let" s hide him.
- My friend!
- Hey, buddy.
Really?
- Yeah, he" s in the car.
- Come on, stop arguing.
- You" re the one arguing.
That" s your idea?
- Who will look here?
- People throwing garbage out.
- You" re like my mom.
- Oh, he" s hidden now.
- Now you can thank me.
For thinking of a garbage room?
At the beach.
Here you go, a nude picture of Ramiro.
Your penis is tiny, Ramiro.
- What the hell are you laughing at?
- Ramiro, maybe we should go?
- Are you leaving already?
- The car is parked wrong.
- You just got here.
- Weren" t we having dinner?
- That would be nice.
- Put money in the parking meter.
- Will you come back?
- We have to go.
Go tell Dad, he went to the garbage room.
- What" s he doing there?
- Smoking.
- He" s smoking in the garbage room?
- He doesn" t think anyone knows.
Oye!
I found a man in the garbage room!
Un hombre en el garbage room?
... with a wheelchair!
- What are you doing smoking there?
- You can" t smoke in there!
- In my own garbage room?
There" s a man there!
Anders, we have to go now.
It" s no good.
- Let" s take him and go.
- Wait until Ramiro comes back.
- What did they say?
- I fixed it.
They" re coming from the hospital to pick him up.
- How did he get out of there?
- It" s a big hospital, ma.
People disappear all the time.
God damn...
Thank God your parents think we" re these nice youths.
Thank you, Niklas Gustavsson for being so damned drugged.
Hey, it" s what" s his name!
Niklas Gustavsson, the racist.
Hey, come here!
Hey, take it easy!
Relax, we" re not Nazis!
Go!
- What are you doing?
We" re not racists.
- I don" t care if he" s with 20 people.
- We just borrowed him.
- Why do you have him?
- Come with me.
- Stop it.
- What a dick.
- What are you on?
How you doing there, kid?
What do you think your parents thought of that?
What did they think?
Johnny, you have to switch clothes with Niklas.
You" ve been nominated racist of the year.
Gimme five, Johnny.
- What a mess, man.
- The cops are on us.
- What did you say?
- The cops are on us.
- Stop.
- Are you nuts?
- Drive!
- Relax.
- Drive!
- L" m driving, Johnny.
- I can" t do time.
Drive!
- L" m driving, damn it.
- Maja, I have 28000 in unpaid bills.
- What?
Since I quit my job, l" ve been broke.
That" s insane.
- 28000.
Can you show them?
There" s several from the payment enforcement agency.
Why haven" t you said anything?
Have you tried to pay it?
- L" ve got Babylon Disease.
- What is that?
You talk about it all the time.
Why don" t you explain it?
Alright, l" il explain.
It" s like this.
My life is arranged so I don" t have to be intelligent, to think.
L" m controlled, a consumer.
Like when I read a paper or watch TV -
- that" s something created to make me think that I know what" s going on.
I should be amused by talk show hosts -
- and identify with at least one character on "Friends".
I live in a country that" s supposedly neutral.
Which means letting Nazis come straight through, but quietly.
My friends are from the same tired social group.
We wake up and go to a job because we have to be there.
Because we have to be part of the production.
- to make us feel anxiety and pain, to make us feel like shit.
Babylon keeps feeding us short term solutions.
- Like anti- depressants.
- Is that why you don" t pay bills?
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.
Sorry.
- Yeah, but not like this.
Being billed by people who don" t care about me.
L" m tired of being a consumer, tired of the profit motive.
I don" t know what to do about it.
I quit my job, so we can take your bills -
- and build a hut in the woods, live there and grow potatoes.
Mattias.
What?
Hi.
Anders Svensson called and told me he was here.
- We" re his friends.
- You" il have to wait a bit.
- How long do we have to wait?
- I can" t answer that.
Thank you very much.
You" re welcome.
- He" s gone completely...
- Must" ve hit his head.
- Hi.
- That was the craziest thing.
- Are we going?
- So, what happened?
It was completely insane.
Since we helped him from those guys who were going to beat him -
- which is all he remembers, nothing happened.
And he probably didn" t want anyone to know about the growth on his ass.
That" s like he" s showing his real colors.
I really mean it.
Before you get a cop up your nose.
Are you okay?
- Hi.
- There you are.
You" ve got a visitor.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hello.
Hi.
- How have you been?
- It" s been great.
- Hi.
But, yeah, it" s been really good.
- Well...
- Do you want something to drink?
- Yes, please.
But it" s pretty cool.
My problem is who I make out with tonight.
Not Olle, cause he" s not at all my type.
You and Mattias are my type.
- to take a cab together from here.
Cut it out, Paulie.
- We both know it" s not true.
- I could be in love with you.
- Cheers.
What" s the matter?
- I can" t take it.
- Take a walk.
Take it easy.
This is Maja" s thing, okay?
What" s the matter?
- What" s the matter?
Are you pissed?
No, I was before, but l" m just tired of being bored.
It was just boring.
Want to go to my place?
- What" s the matter?
- Olle, I...
I don" t think...
I think...
I don" t think this is going to work.
How do you mean?
No you didn" t.
- And you didn" t call me.
- That" s why I came.
- You came for the party, not me.
I came to the party to be with you.
It" s this that l" m tired of.
I leave the party without bitching, because I want to go with you.
What the hell is your problem?
Come on...
- Just leave, then.
- Alright, I will.
Maja...
Hi.
Are you sleeping here?
I know you" re in love with Mattias, Maja.
Since you are, why don" t you tell him?
Do something.
I promise you have nothing to lose.
I know.
You" re right.
Why is everyone...
Why am I so damned scared all the time?
You" re not the only one that" s scared.
It" s not easy being human.
I mean, look at me.
Even though you" re living in the West, with luxury problems.
Not knowing what to wear, what to do for a living.
You know?
- is someone that sees you.
Someone to see who you are.
Someone that can see that you can be small, too.
- You understand?
- I understand.
What are you thinking?
- What do you think?
- Me?
Hi, it" s me.
Too bad you" re not home, I wanted to...
I just wanted to say that...
I want you to know...... that I get it.
I get the whole thing, what you" re talking about.
But I think it can get better, because...
Just think about the fact that we" ve met.
- the remedy for the entire Babylon Disease thing.
L" m in love with you.
I think.
And that feels good.
Aw, shit!
Hey, you dick!
Lt" s the racist.

That' s right, 1 6- 0.
Oh, and here' s the best part:
Your second- favorite man was MVP.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I shouldn' t tell you that.
He should tell you.
Hold on.
Why don' t you try their doorbell with your ghetto self.
Move.
Can you reach that?
- Look at this place.
- Glad you guys could come.
Oh, you know, we try to be up in here, baby.
Yo, what' s up?
This is a nice crib.
He must be in somebody else' s room.
Like I was saying, you know, I' m Junior Battle.
I' m the man.
- That' s what I' m talking about.
- I know.
- So you ain' t got no boyfriend?
- Maybe.
You looking for your team?
Yes, sir.
Oh, baby.

This is my style right here.
I' m amazing.
Feel me, Lyle?
Let me get a coochie juice.

This water' s probably cold as hell, shorty.
I don' t know.
And swimming ain' t my cup of tea, baby.

Heated.
Probably 90 degrees.
- We don' t have bathing suits.
- Right.
Neither do we.
Oh, so it' s like that?
Show me the money, then, know what I' m saying?
- Damn!
- Since it' s like that.
Oh, damn.
Yeah, that' s nice.
- Damn!
- You are looking right.
I like that.
You guys coming?
We' re getting in there.
I gotta take my chain off so it don' t turn green.
Oh, man, I can' t believe this.
Heaven!
Excuse me.
- Can I help you?
- I' m Ken Carter, coach of the Richmond High basketball team.
Richmond?
- You' re a little lost, aren' t you?
- Well, I' m looking for my son.
The cab driver told me he dropped the team off here for a party.
Excuse me.
Oh, my God, is that --?
Oh, my God, it' s Susan' s dad.
You see your son?
Yes, sir, I do.
Damien Carter.
Get your ass out of that pool.
Yes, sir.
Richmond High players, let' s go!
- Coach!
- Hey, Worm, where did you go?
Worm?
What up, coach?
I got somebody I want you to meet.
Now, I just met her, but she is fine as hell.
- Her name is...
- Susan!
- Susan.
He right!
- Oh, shit.
My daughter, Susan.
You are not going to like what happens in practice on Monday.
You think you' ve run for me before?
I come to your rooms to celebrate with you, and you sneak --
I end up taking a road trip to the suburbs, where I find my drunk- ass point guard on top of Daddy' s little princess!
Actually, I was on the bottom, coach.
She was on the top.
Worm, do you wanna be on this team?
Because you' re about six words from getting kicked off and kicked off the goddamn bus!
Cruz, open your eyes!
Ghetto hoop stars!
Signing autographs and humping the honeys!
Well, I' m gonna show you what humping is.
Coach, we won the tournament.
We undefeated.
I mean, ain' t that what you wanted?
Winners?
Oh, no.
Oh, no, no, no.
Oh, no!
God --!
You guys are awesome!
What' s up, Cruz?
I don' t know.
Coach giving us a day off, I guess.
Yo, I don' t even know where the library' s even at.
- I bet you don' t.
- "Library' s at"?
He don' t know where the library' s at.
Quiet.
Quiet!
Gentlemen, in this hand, I hold contracts signed by me and signed by you.
ln this hand, I hold academic- progress reports prepared by your teachers.
We have six players failing at least one class, eight players getting incompletes based on attendance.
Gentlemen, you have failed to up --
No, I' m sorry.
We have failed.
We have failed each other.
Now, there are some of you who have upheld this contract.
But know that we are a team.
And until we all meet the terms of this contract, the gym will remain locked.
- Locked?
- What?
- What you mean, locked?
- What, like for the day?
- He must mean for the day.
Mr. Gesek and Miss Sherman have generously volunteered their time to help us reach our goals.
That' s good, sir.
Do you score all the points for the team too?
We are the Richmond Oilers.
Do you know what Oilers stands for?
Sir?
Know that you' re not just walking out on me.
You' re walking out on them.
I had to beg you.
And then I ran all those sprints.
I did all that shit.
I killed myself for you, sir, to get back on the team.
This is bullshit.
You put a lock on the gym and forced them to meet you in the library?
- Are you crazy?
- Miss Garrison.
I' m surprised you know where my office is.
Take the lock off that gym.
My phone hasn' t stopped ringing.
Maybe someone on the other end of that phone has a solution to our problem.
Your intentions are good, Mr. Carter, but your methods are a bit extreme.
You painted an extreme picture.
No one expects them to graduate, no one expects them to go to college.
- Yes, ma' am.
And you challenge them academically?
- Yes, ma' am.
- And what if they fail?
Then we' ve failed.
Unfortunately, Mr. Carter, both you and I know that for some of these kids, this basketball season will be the highlight of their lives.
Well, I think that' s the problem.
Don' t you?
- Good morning, Coach Carter.
- Good morning.
Quite the Pandora' s box you' ve opened.
Oh, I get all the blame now?
Let' s just say I' m happy to give you all the credit.
I' ve got every news reporter in town waiting to speak to you.
Got a press conference set up around the front of the gymnasium.
Coach Carter has taken the lockout to the next level by canceling last night' s game.
Richmond forfeited the game, making it their first loss of the season.
And for now, the lock remains on the gym.
Here he comes now.
Coach!
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
I' d like to thank you for your patience.
At this time, I' d like to introduce Coach Ken Carter.
You may direct your questions to him.
Mr. Carter, is it unfair to the players whose grades qualify them to play?
Basketball' s a team sport, sir.
We support each other on and off the court.
Anybody still think coach bluffing now?
I feel like running right up in the middle of all those reporters and telling them I think this is bullshit, son.
Maybe you should' ve gone to class, Lyle.
Maybe you should kiss my ass, dog.
My grades are fine, homeboy.
- It' s Junior they should' ve locked out.
- Maybe Junior will kick your ass out.
- Why don' t you try spelling it, then.
Damn.
- Junior, if you need help, I' il tutor you.
- Man, I don' t need no help.
Well, he ain' t lock us out for no reason.
We been tripping lately, man.
All y' all know it.
How do you think the community' s gonna react to this lockout?
I' m not really sure.
I hope they' il support these young men.
What, man?
No, man, it' s just funny, dog, because, Junior, man, you thought it was bad all us knew your dumb ass was failing science.
Now the whole world about to know your dumb ass failing science.
And you have Fremont this Saturday, the biggest game on your schedule.
Now, Richmond is gonna riot if you forfeit that game.
Saturday is a long way off.
We' il see what happens.
Thank you all for coming.
That' s all the time I have right now.
I have to get back to work.
Coach, have you talked to any of the parents?
Thank you for your time, ladies and gentlemen.
I' d like to remind you that classes are in session, so as you leave campus, please do so quietly.
I ain' t turning the cheek.
He come up in my 'hood, I' m serious, it' s on.
- It' s always been like that.
It' s been a long day.
Reporters.
Media everywhere.
Let' s take this time to say whatever it is we want while the doors are closed.
You have the floor.
This is about us.
Man, this shit ain' t about us.
This is all about Coach Carter.
We' re the basketball team.
All I see is you on TV, getting famous, eating that shit up.
- ls that all you see?
- It' s all I see.
You ain' t lying.
Well, let me tell you what I see.
I see a system that' s designed for you to fail.
Now, I know you all like stats, so let me give you some.
Richmond High only graduates 50 percent of its students.
And of those that do graduate, only 6 percent go to college.
Which tells me, when I walk down the halls and I look in your classrooms, maybe only one student is going to go to college.
"Well, damn, Coach Carter, if I ain' t going to college, where I' m gonna go?"
Now, that' s a great question.
And the answer for young African- American men in here is this: probably to prison.
ln this county, 33 percent of black males between 1 8 and 24 get arrested.
So look at the guy on your left.
Now look at the guy on your right.
One of you is going to get arrested.
Growing up here in Richmond, you' re 80 percent more likely to go to prison than college.
Those are the numbers.
Those are some stats for your ass.
Now, I want you to go home...... and look at your lives tonight...... and look at your parents' lives...... and ask yourself, "Do I want better?"
I' il see you here tomorrow.
And I promise you...... l will do everything in my power to get you to college and to a better life.
I don' t understand this.
It' s a letter, how can it be a number?
How are balancing those equations coming?
- I can' t do this.
Don' t give up yet, son.
Here' s a story out of California that' s getting national attention.
The entire boys' basketball team at Richmond High School has been benched.
The highly ranked Oilers have a perfect season on the court, but some players were in big trouble academically.
And in an unprecedented move, Coach Ken Carter canceled practice,
locked the gym and sent his players straight to the library.
I understand you made all of your players sign a contract before they could join the team.
What exactly were the conditions of that contract?
The contract states that the players must maintain a 2. 3 grade point average and that the players must attend all their classes and sit in the front row of those classes.
Well, Coach Carter, it' s an unusual strategy, and a risky one in a sense, in light of your team' s winning record, but I think there' s gonna be a lot of people out there pleased to learn that at least somebody still cares about the concept of a student athlete.
Thanks a lot for joining us today.
I' m sorry to disturb you.
I' m Coach Ken Carter of the Richmond High School basketball team.
I need to ask you a favor.
My team is studying in the library, and I' ve been trying to tell them that brains and beauty are a perfect combination.
Know what I' m saying?
I mean, I' m Worm, baby.
How would you like to watch the Worm work?
Hey, where did you get that backpack?
Watch out, Too Short.
Why study earth science or history or algebra?
Getting good grades in those subjects, combined with basketball skills, can get you into college.
I would' ve worn it.
You selfish son of a bitch.
You snake.
- Miss -- - No, no, don' t "miss" me, snake.
Mr. Carter, you remember me?
Now, after all the things that my son has been through for your team, for you to go lock up this gym like this, how dare you...
Open up the damn gym!
Let the boys play!
What' s up, little cousin?
How you doing?
Got something for me?
That' s what I' m talking about.
Put it down, man.
- You Coach Carter, right?
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah?
Check this out, man.
- Hey, hold on, man.
- Yeah.
How you like that?
- Oh, hell no.
- What?
- You wanna get out the car?
- Let' s talk about this.
- Ain' t nothing to talk about.
Just open up the gym, man.
Let them boys play.
Yeah, see?
Yeah.
- Get on!
- Don' t be no punk.
Say what you gotta say.
- Dad.
Relax.
Relax, let it go.
No, I ain' t letting nothing go.
These people in Richmond -- Goddamn it!
- Damn it!
Chill out.
It' s over.
All right?
He doesn' t mean anything.
It' s over.
Let it go.
Come on, get back in the car.
Let' s go.
I think you know who she is, but she' s got a friend.
You gotta hook me up.
Why I always gotta hook him up?
Sound like I' m the Love Connection.
Just start a conversation.
I' il take care of it.
- Yeah.
- Yes, girl.
But, see...
I was just ready to duff Duke out.
- Some serious shit.
- You should have did it, man.
Know what I' m saying?
- You let somebody do that to you.
- I let him?
- Yo, Oscar, man.
- What?
I' il be right out.
- I gotta talk to you.
- I already told you...
- No.
You guys is kind of passing...
- I know I' m fine.
But I' m not feeling myself, I' m feeling you.
Hey, I' m gonna holler at my boys across the street for a quick minute.
Hurry up, man.
- All right.
- You know who we are, then?
- What do we have here?
- Punk, punk, punk.
- Bitches.
Dummy and dumb and dumber.
I mean, what the hell is the bitchman from Richmond doing on our side of the turf?
You garbage.
- Shut up, woman.
I don' t understand how y' all won.
- Y' all wack- star niggas.
- Y' all wacked.
Yo, shut your bitch ass up.
- I don' t wanna hear you talking shit.
- Homey, you a benchwarmer!
Get the hell out my face, whitey!
Let' s do it, homey.
- What you trying to do?
- He got a piece, man.
You feel me right now?
- Y' all brought a gun.
Feel me?
Keep it up the block, homey.
I' m right here, homey.
Right here.
It' s all good.
Y' all brought a gun!
Pinole!
Bitch- ass...
Pinole, right?
- Are they serious?
- I' il knock his braids out.
Nice to see the fight in you, dog.
- Appreciate the backup.
Word.
I' m gonna see y' all later, all right?
- Good looking.
No doubt.
- You got this.
This is my paper, man.
I' m not playing with you.
Then why don' t you stop getting in my face.
Renny!
Renny!
I can' t believe -- He was just standing there.
- Renny!
- Oh, shit.
Call 91 1.
- Call 91 1, man.
I need something...
I just need you to stay with me, okay?
Hold his head up.
Somebody help me!
- Cruz?
- I wanna come back, coach.
- What' s going on?
- I wanna come back on the team.
What the hell happened?
They shot him.
They shot Renny.
We was just there.
Everything was good.
- Everything was good, coach.
I mean, you know...
- Come on.
- You don' t understand.
I wanna come back on the team.
What do I gotta do to play?
Don' t worry about that, son.
Just come inside.
I' il do it, okay?
Okay.
I got you.
Come on.
Come on, you' re back with us now.
I can' t believe they shot him.
Just come inside now, all right?
- I just wanna be on the team.
Come on.
I' il do it, okay?
The state only requires a 2. 0 GPA for participation in extracurricular activities.
- Yes, ma' am.
- And according to your contract, the players are agreeing to maintain a 2. 3?
Yes, ma' am.
- Other things like...?
- Attending all classes, sitting in the front row of those classes, and wearing a tie on game day.
I see.
Mr. Carter, does the lockout include practices and games?
And do you have a set period of time?
There will be no basketball, ma' am.
Quiet, please.
That includes practices and games, until we as a team reach the agreed- upon GPA.
Please, quiet.
Quiet.
Thank you, Mr. Carter.
ln the interest of time, I' d like to open this board meeting up for comments.
As a teacher, I was offended when asked by a coach to provide progress reports.
Nowhere in my contract does it say that I have to do so.
It creates more work.
This lockout has brought negative media attention that questions our abilities as educators.
End this madness.
End this lockout.
I' m Jason Lyle' s uncle.
That boy lives to play ball.
Comes to school every day now.
You take away basketball,
God knows what he' d be into.
Yesterday, he canceled the Fremont game.
Now, that' s the biggest game of the year.
- Me too.
- These boys are 1 6- 0.
This whole school, this whole community, is behind this team.
Everybody goes to every game.
Basketball is the only thing that these boys have got.
Are we gonna let Carter come in here and take that away from them?
- No!
- I don' t think so.
Not gonna happen.
- I' d like to make a motion.
- Yes, Mr. Walters?
I move that we remove Mr. Carter as head basketball coach.
Order.
This board does not have the authority to terminate employment of a staff position.
Then I move we end the lockout and let the kids play.
I second the motion.
- Okay.
- lf I may?
Yes, Mr. Carter.
You really need to consider the message that you' re sending these boys.
It' s the same message that we as a culture send to our pro athletes, which is that they are above the law.
Now, I' m trying to teach these boys the discipline that will inform their lives and give them choices.
lf you endorse the fact that 1 5 -, 1 6 - and 1 7- year- olds don' t have to honor the simple rules of a basketball contract, how long do you think it' il be before they' re out there breaking laws?
Now, I played basketball at Richmond 30 years ago.
It was the same thing then.
Some of my teammates ended up in prison.
Some of them ended up dead.
I took this job because I wanted to effect change in a special group of young men, and this is the only way I know how to do that.
lf you vote to end the lockout, you won' t have to terminate me.
Good.
Thank you, Mr. Carter.
The board now recognizes five voting members.
ln this instance, we will be accepting the vote of Principal Garrison as well.
Now, I put to those members the vote on whether or not to end the lockout.
All those in favor of ending the lockout will raise their right hand when called upon.
I will vote first by not raising my hand.
Principal Garrison?
Valerie Walker.
Benson Chiu.
Parent rep, Mr. Cepeda.
And Ms. Nyugen.
- Yes.
- Thank you.
The lockout ends with a vote of 4 to 2.
lf there' s no other business, this board meeting is adjourned.
Thank you all for coming.
Mr. Carter.
Are you sure you wanna do this?
Look, I know we haven' t always seen eye to eye, but you' ve done such a great job with these boys, it seems wrong to just --
No offense, ma' am, but all the work I did with those boys was negated when they ended the lockout.
I don' t think that' s true, l --
The board sent the message loud and clear.
Winning basketball games is more important than graduating from high school and going to college.
I' m sorry, I just can' t support that message.
Sir, they can cut the chain off the door, but they can' t make us play.
We' ve decided we' re gonna finish what you started, sir.
Yeah, so leave us be, coach.
We got shit to do, sir.
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.
Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.
It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us.
Your playing small does not serve the world.
There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won' t feel insecure around you.
We were all meant to shine, as children do.
It' s not just in some of us, it' s in everyone.
And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.
As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.
Sir, I just wanna say thank you.
You saved my life.
Thank you, sirs.
All of you.
Academic- progress reports, young men.
These things are...... unbelievable.
I know you' ve been trying.
I guess there' s only one way to say this.
Let' s play ball.
Rich what?
Richmond!
Rich what?
Richmond!
Rich what?
Richmond!
Get back, get back.
Set it.
Watch baseline.
- Yes!
Find a man.
Swing it, swing it.
Go, go, go.
Go Richmond!
Hold the ball, hold the ball!
Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, see you!
- Great game, coach.
- Good game.
Richmond returns from their lockout and keeps their streak alive at 1 7 games.
A team that won only four games last year is now a Cinderella team that has to be thinking that there' s a chance of getting the phone call to come to the dance.
ls Richmond headed for the state tournament?
So, what else y' all gonna do at the park when you go?
- Seesaw?
- You' re gonna seesaw?
- Yeah.
- My mommy' s gonna push me.
Yeah?
That' s good.
I wish I could go with you.
- Come on, baby.
- But I' il see you later, okay?
- Bye.
- Bye.
How you been?
Good.
You look good.
Thank you.
So do you.
Considering.
You know, everything' s been crazy, with the lockout.
Yeah, it' il be all right.
For sure.
Can we sit down somewhere?
I' ve been trying to get my head straight about things.
A lot of things.
Especially us.
- Kenny, l -- - Kyra, just listen.
Please.
For a long time, it' s just been my moms, my boys and you.
And that' s what I counted on.
I' m trying to count on myself now, and I' m all right and shit, it' s just, without you, nothing good feels as good.
It' s like I' m missing some happy part of me.
I got you something.
And it ain' t from the 99 Cent Store.
Shut up.
- They gave you a scholarship?
- Yeah, baby, a full ride.
Oh, my gosh.
That is crazy.
Oh, my gosh.
I know you gonna kill it up there.
No, we gonna kill it up there.
I told them about you and the baby.
They wanna help us.
Kenyon...... there is no more baby.
I decided not to go through with it.
Kyra.
I had a choice to make, so I made it.
For me, Kenny.
Well, when...?
Why didn' t you tell me?
I would have gone with you.
I' m so sorry.
Kyra, I' m so sorry you had to go through that by yourself.
My mom went with me.
I think you should go to school and play ball and do your thing.
You know?
I want that for you.
And that' s real.
I think you should be all you can.
I want you to come with me.
Kyra, I love you.
I want you to come with me.
- You serious?
- I' m serious.
- Oh, my God.
- I love you.
I love you too.
Ken Carter.
I understand, sir.
All right.
Thank you, sir.
We' re in.
Guys, guys, guys.
Now, listen.
It' s not gonna be easy.
It' s gonna be a long road.
- We' re a really low seed.
- Who did we get, coach?
St. Francis.
St. Francis?
Coach, they ranked number one in the state.
Hey, yo, Junior, man, don' t worry about Ty Crane, dog.
You' il get him.
We got this.
One game at a time.
We got this.
- All right, guys.
- It' s on.
- Bring your A game, young man.
- Yes, sir.
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the first round of the ClF playoffs.
St. Francis is one of the best high school teams in the nation, with Ty Crane believed to be a shoo- in for the top NBA draft pick next year.
On the other side of the court is Richmond, a team that' s had a media- worthy season as well.
Richmond High has never played in a state tournament.
Let' s go, let' s go.
- Settle down, settle down.
- 1 - 4!
Ball, ball.
Move, move.
Good shot, baby.
- Get back, get back.
Run motion.
Force him left.
You gotta force him left.
The baseline' s another defender.
D up!
I' m dropping 50.
Set up!
Get over here and help.
He shouldn' t be scoring.
Get back, get back.
Find your man, find your man.
Watch that trap.
Yes!
S- C- O- R- E!
Score!
Score!
Ball, man!
Lyle, stop the ball.
Less talk out there.
Come on, come on, come on.
Let' s go, Richmond!
You gotta help Junior on the weak- side pick.
- Delilah!
Defense!
- Delilah!
Delilah!
Delilah!
- Get there, get there.
- Trap, trap, trap.
Left side, left side.
- Use the pick, use the pick.
- I got it.
- Foul, number three.
- Hold up.
- Number three.
- Mustangs, bring it in.
- Count the basket.
- Damn.
Time.
Come here, come here.
Damn it.
Come on, guys, keep up the defense!
Come on, what you gonna do?
Come on, fellas.
Gentlemen, you told me you deserved to be here.
Well, you' re not playing like it.
All season long, we played our game.
Right now, you' re playing theirs.
When we step on the floor, every second that clock is ticking, we are pedal to the metal.
We run the ball.
We pressure the ball.
And most importantly, we control the tempo of the game!
We make them play Richmond Oiler ball.
Worm, you can take this kid.
Force him left, and when he crosses over, you jump him.
Damien, push the tempo.
Kenyon, Lyle, crash the boards.
Cruz, when you' re in the game in transition, take that jumper you love.
Junior, just keep doing what you' re doing.
Hold on to that monster.
You do those things, gentlemen, and I guarantee you, at the end of the game, we will be there.
All right, hands in.
- All right, take control of this game.
Who' s gonna win this game?
Let' s go.
Let' s do this.
One, two, three, Mustangs!
- Get up, get up.
- Go, go, go.
Yes.
- Reach- in foul.
- That' s the only damn one.
- How you gonna call that on me, ref?
- Good call, ref.
Cruz. ln for Kenyon.
- Ball, ball, ball, ball.
- Run it, run it, run it.
Get back, get back!
Everybody get back.
Come on!
Get back, get back, get back.
Ref, you gotta call that.
This is my house.
- Push, push.
- Can we get a call?
I' m gonna catch my breath.
Come on.
Get back, get back.
I got it.
Charge.
- Yeah, baby.
Charge, number 30.
Red ball.
Come on, ref, you wasn' t even there.
Red, red, red.
Yes.
- Richmond' s ball.
- What?
Let' s go.
- Red ball.
- Junior, good block!
- I know that' s a foul.
- It' s all ball.
- What are you talking about?
- What' s up, man?
Knock his bitch ass out.
Calm down, man.
We' re still in the game.
Come on.
Get out of my way, man.
Get off me.
Let' s go.
They' re standing on the edge of a cliff.
All we gotta do is push them off.
We' re gonna run Candy.
Worm, you gotta sell them the pass to Damien.
Junior, we come to you on the weak- side seal.
But, gentlemen, just because you deserve this doesn' t mean they' re gonna give it to you.
Sometimes you gotta take what' s yours.
You ready to do this?
- Hell, yeah.
- Let' s go.
- Come on, take this.
Richmond on three.
One, two, three, Richmond!
Let' s go.
- I got you.
1 - 4, 1 - 4!
- All right.
- Defense!
Mustangs!
Candy!
Ball, Damien.
- Move, move.
- Help, help.
Get back, get back, get back!
Junior, get back!
Hands up!
Yeah!
Hold on, hold on.
Battle, Battle!
Battle!
You' re real, man.
All right?
Keep your head up, baby.
Well, not quite your storybook ending, huh?
Not for us, anyway.
But you men played like champions.
You never gave up.
And champions hold their heads high.
What you achieved goes way beyond the win- loss column or what' s gonna be written on the front page of the sports section tomorrow.
You' ve achieved something that some people spend their whole lives trying to find.
What you achieved is that ever- elusive victory within.
And, gentlemen...... l am so proud of you.
Four months ago, when I took the job at Richmond, I had a plan.
That plan failed.
I came to coach basketball players, and you became students.
I came to teach boys...... and you became men.
And for that, I thank you.
lf someone walked in this door right now and offered me the coaching job at any school in the state of California, you know which team I' d choose?
St. Francis?
I' m just saying, man.
Kenyon?
- Richmond?
- Rich what?
- Richmond.
- Rich what?
Richmond.
- Rich what?
- Richmond.
- Where we from?
- Richmond!
- What' s my hometown?
- Richmond!
- What do we love?
- Richmond!
- Rich what?
- Richmond!
Oh, Magoo, you' ve done it again.
Another day in the can.
Good night, Mrs Wonderbottom.
Ugliest hairdo I' ve ever seen.
Hold the elevator!
Elevator with a view!
Now that' s what I call an express.
Earthquake!
Don' t panic, everyone.
We' ve got enough canned food here to cover any emergency.
That' s better.
Carry on, boys.
Parking lot.
Whoopsie.
By George, somebody fix the lights... before anyone trips.
The escalator to the parking lot.
Such sophistication!
- Good night, Henry.
- Good night.
Right turn only.
Road hog!
Blasted potholes!
The checkered flag?
Magoo, you, you speed demon, you!
You' ve still got it.
El Nino' s back.
Oh, Magoo, you' ve done it again.
And tonight, Quincy Magoo, the canned vegetable king... will dedicate the new museum wing he has donated to the city.
The Magoo Rotunda will house a travelling exhibit... of the treasures of Kuristan... including the rarest of all rubies, the Star of Kuristan.
Treat her gently, young fella.
Check underneath.
I think there' s something rattling there.
Yes, you dropped the keys, my boy.
It' s the most precious ruby in the world.
No.
That' s an aluminum oxide.
Okay, don' t take my word for it.
Exquisite is an adjective, not an element.
All right.
If you' re so smart, how come Mr Cloquet told me... to watch you like a hawk?
Cloquet said that?
Why is it that someone always seems to burn the rumaki?
Maybe you should see another eye doctor.
Waldo, Hiram has been my optometrist since I was a small boy in knee pants.
He' s like 2, 000 years old.
All his other patients are dead.
You can' t hold that against him.
But he' s still making appointments with them.
Trust me, you need a second opinion.
Oh, my gosh!
- What?
Don' t look.
- She' s coming this way.
Mr Magoo?
I am Stacey Sampanahoditra of the Kuristani foreign office.
This is my nephew Waldo.
It is an honour.
Oh.
Quite a scholar, you know.
Graduated with a large class.
Isn' t that right, Waldo?
Yeah.
L- I, I w- went there to college.
Uh, Waldo, why don' t you invite, uh, Stacey to our opera tomorrow night?
I would be most honoured, sir.
Stacey... will you join us for the opera tomorrow night?
It' s a, uh, benefit performance.
Uh, we' re doing excerpts from the Norsemen saga.
I look forward to it.
I must greet diplomats.
That' s a very attractive young lady.
l- I tried to offer her a snack.
Oh, Waldo, don' t be so hard on yourself.
Cupid makes fools of us all.
And now, as curator of this museum... it is my pleasure to present our benefactor... a man of great vision, Quincy Magoo.
- Ah, well, thank you, thank you.
Ah, well, may, uh, may all of the exhibits in this hall... chime with the light of human knowledge.
My dear, thank you.
Watch out!
Great Scott!
What is this, indoor fireworks?
What a wonderful touch.
Or a blackout.
I should inform the power company here.
Get that fixed, and get these lights back on.
Hello down here.
Public telephone.
Excuse me, sir.
We have an emergency...
We have an injured man here.
Bandaged from head to foot.
Some assistance, please.
And whoever did it has stolen the telepho...
They gave me a bad mask.
Okay.
I gotta watch her like a hawk.
You stay right here.
No, you' re in no condition...
How many times must I tell you?
Stay back in the booth, man.
I' il take care of him.
I' il get some help or maybe find a telephone.
Freeze!
Drop the gun.
Turn around.
Must be a phone out there somewhere.
Well, if you can' t bring Mohammed to the mountain...
Morning, Angus.
Avast, Angus.
Are you ready to cast off?
What are you doing here?
Oh, just cleaning your windshield.
Aha, my boy, you are a prince, but I have a date with a flounder.
- Anchors aweigh.
- Anchors aweigh.
Oh, the windshield did need cleaning, huh?
I don' t think I' ve seen it this clear since 1956.
Well, now that you' re here, we' d better inform the police.
This incident is to remain completely under wraps.
Which includes the crazy 9- 1- 1 call about a bandaged man in the museum.
We substitute a replica of the jewel and...
Hold it.
And who told the State Department?
I did.
They said they would send two of their very best operatives.
Gustave Anders, ClA.
I' m in charge of this investigation.
Chuck Stupak, FBl, and I' m in charge of this investigation.
The ClA has no jurisdiction on American soil.
This could very well become an international incident.
Not if you don' t get in my way, fancy pants.
I don' t get it.
There' s nothing in the papers.
It' s a trap.
They' re trying to lull us into a false sense of security... and then bust us when we make a careless move.
They' re onto us, Luanne.
- I can feel it in my...
- Morgan, that' s yesterday' s paper.
Nothing like the old sea air to clean out the pipes.
Huh?
The sun is a little hot.
Time to apply the old Ban de Soleil.
A very refreshing, minty fragrance.
They think of everything.
What' s that?
The old fog rolling in, thick as pea soup?
Not my pea soup, mind you, but maybe one of those other brands.
Bob, why steal the Star for your boss, Cloquet, and get peanuts for it... when he can turn around and auction it off for millions?
Why not auction it off ourselves?
That way we get millions and each other.
Me and you?
I could take you to places you' ve never been before.
I' ve never been to Toronto.
I know a little cosy bed- and- breakfast place in Toronto... but we could skip the breakfast part.
Come on, Angus.
We won' t let a little fog stop us, huh?
You rotten seagulls!
You con- sarned buzzards, you!
Uncivilized behaviour.
I' d never do anything like that to you.
I' m gonna have to get this dry- cleaned now.
Blast your...
I' ve got a strike.
Well, shiver my timbers!
Just call me Ishmael.
It' s Moby Dick!
Look at that, Angus.
It' s huge.
He was a big one, Angus.
Just look at the size of those, uh, uh, pants.
Well, I' d say we were in the Bermuda Triangle... but we' re nowhere near Bermuda.
I' il just play it safe and head for shore.
Well, Angus, here we are in safe harbour once again.
Well, an escalator to the top.
How swank.
Must be a yacht club.
Angus, where are you, boy?
Well, hello, Angus.
Come on there, fella.
We believe Magoo created a diversion while his accomplices stole the jewel.
But why?
Mr Magoo is a very wealthy man.
People do eat a lot more fresh food these days.
Okay, we don' t collar Magoo.
We put him under surveillance.
But this is absurdity.
I' m to be his guest at the opera tonight.
Great!
You can be our inside person.
That is, if it' s all right with the FBl.
So, Magoo has the Star of Kuristan.
But it was Luanne' s fault!
She double- crossed us.
But she' s the only one capable of stealing the Star.
How could someone with such beauty... be so treacherous?
I worship all that is beautiful, Morgan.
The greatest sin is to destroy a thing of beauty.
I fear now we must destroy the beautiful Miss Le Seur.
Kill her.
But first, get the stone, all right?
Tomorrow buyers are arriving from all over the world to bid on the ruby.
Havzinski.
I hear there' s a rumour Ortega Peru might even show.
The Piranha?
The king of the underworld?
Oh, Morgan, don' t screw this up, hmm?
On my way!
- Hello, sir.
- Um, oh, Stacey!
Aren' t you a sight for sore eyes?
I thought that Waldo was going to pick you up, uh, on the way to the opera.
Well, in my country, the invitee always picks up the inviter.
I' m sure that Waldo would not have it any other way.
Unc, I need to borrow a tie.
- Hello, Waldo.
Uh, why don' t you, uh, show Stacey the garden before you leave?
It' s quiet and, uh, and peaceful... and, uh, intimate.
I, l, I don' t think she' d want to see the...
I' d love to see more of your charming home.
It' s right back here.
The smell of rice is in the air.
Love in bloom, if ever I' ve seen it before.
Angus?
How many times... have I told you to stay out of that closet?
Come on in here, boy.
Help me with my scales.
It' s my uncle' s work.
Never have I seen such a plant sculpture.
Topiary' s kind of a hobby of his.
And he specializes in the abstract.
Oh, no.
That' s a bunny rabbit.
What is that?
Is that it?
Ah, well, it' s a dog' s life.
There it goes.
Your uncle, do you think he needs glasses?
Just don' t try and tell him that.
I notice he drives a very old car.
Is his business not healthy?
He just loves that old car.
And if Unc loves something, he won' t let it go.
Angus!
Stop terrorizing the squirrels.
- Stupak!
- Where are you?
Right behind you.
Just spotted a conspicuous white male.
- Sticks out like a sore thumb.
Can' t see him.
Turn around.
Don' t turn around.
- Walk backwards.
- What?
Walk backwards.
More!
More.
Stop.
- Where?
- Look to your left.
Aha.
Uh, one minute, please.
Uh, uh, may I help you?
Oh, that voice.
The tone!
It belongs to the world, but for the moment it' s mine alone.
And I tremble.
Prunella.
- Mr Magoo, I presume?
- Uh, yes.
And, uh, you are, um...
Prunella Pagliacci, reporter for "The Opera News."
I knew a young lady once named Prunella.
Mr Magoo, w- will you consent to an interview?
Well, why not?
Uh, back here, uh, tonight, after the show.
No, I, I wouldn' t want to share you with all of your well- wishers.
Oh, well, uh, uh, uh, a private, uh, rendezvous.
Uh, a walk on the beach at, uh, Sandy Cove... uh, shall we say, noon tomorrow?
I' il be there early.
Be wonderful tonight.
Great Scott!
Uh, did you hear that, Angus?
She doesn' t want to share me with anyone.
Is it possible after all these years, another duet at last?
"O Solo Mio" no more.
Stupak.
Where are you?
I am Rolvaag king of Norway
- Break a leg, Mr Magoo.
- Ah, Rumford, yes.
Thank you, uh, Sam.
King of Norway
Where am I?
Oh, backstage.
Let' s go.
Stupak, where are you?
What' s going on in there?
I am Rolvaag king of Norway
Go out there a nobody, come back a star.
And remember, always sit down whenever you can.
That man' s got a very big head.
Ah, stage, uh...
Stage left.
Time to warm up for the old fight scene.
Get over there and shut off that fan!
I am a crusty lusty Viking
That was the note that brought a lump to the judges' throats.
After that, I knew the Van Cliburn award was mine.
Well, the years have not dimmed its beauty.
Oh, thank you.
Any, uh, more questions?
Uh, not that I want this interview to end.
Oh, me, too.
It' s just, just been such a thrill... to hear the story of your life in song, Mr Magoo, I mean real...
Call me Quincy.
Quincy, I' m really happy I got this chance to know you.
I' d like to get to know you better.
Ah, Prunella, could this be a new beginning?
- Yes, of the end.
- Of the end?
The beginning of discovery.
How nice.
- This is a very special day, Prunella.
- Oh, for me, too, Quincy.
Ah, then you know that this is the opening of the carp fishing season?
- Of course!
And I' m so happy we' re experiencing it together.
As am I. Eh, together, yes.
I learned that the hard way.
When you have something precious, you must keep it in sight all the time.
Something precious, such as, say, a jewel?
The most precious jewel of all.
What does this jewel look like?
A flaming red...
- Ruby?
- Ruby, yes!
- Where do you keep this ruby?
- Close to my heart.
Oh, I' m sorry, Quincy, but I, I want you to kiss me.
No, b- but not here.
Someplace private, like a, like a boat.
Do you happen to have a boat?
"Anchors aweigh."
Prunella.
Well, my boat is just down here.
Bingo!
The Black Widow.
No one has ever been able to finger her.
- Maybe a book deal.
- Hey, where' re you going?
Nothing like the warm sea air.
Look at that.
Look at that.
Isn' t that wonderful?
- Now, Quincy, there' s an idea.
Where do you keep your tackle box?
Oh, my tackle box is back at the house.
Ah, but this is wonderful.
The open sea, it' s magnificent.
Isn' t it wonderful?
What?
- I think I sprained my ankle.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
L- It' il be okay.
I just need to rest it.
- Okay.
Just sit down, and I' il head for the shore.
- Oh, could we go to your house?
Well, I' il put the wheel to the keel and the gas to the mast!
I hope I' m to your liking
Well?
Waldo, we mustn' t.
Well, w- why not?
l- ls there someone else?
- It' s Mr Magoo.
- What?
Your government thinks Mr Magoo stole the Star of Kuristan.
Do you think he did it?
Waldo, I need your help.
Hey, we don' t have a warrant... so be quick about it, or we' ve both had it.
- Testing.
One, two, three.
- Got it, loud and clear.
Mayday!
He' s back.
Don' t.
Put me down.
- My ankle' s fine.
Well... with a little more practise, I, uh, could pop the question.
Oh, your house is beautiful.
Do you mind if I look around?
Look away.
I' il just put my hat in the closet here, and...
May I make you a cocktail?
Do you think you could cook us something?
Something hot?
Can I cook?
You may call me "Cordon Bleu" Magoo.
Uh, which way to the little girls' room?
Ah, atop the stairs.
Let me light your way.
Ah, ah, your repast awaits you down here, my dove.
Next I want you to put some water on to boil.
And while we' re waiting for that, let' s clean about, oh... two or three sprigs of parsley.
Water on to boil.
Next, pat the chicken dry.
Now, take some lemon and rub it on the chicken.
Now, make sure you get the whole chicken.
Lift the leg if you have to.
Now, I hope you' re not cheating and using bottled lemon juice.
Angus, there you are, old friend.
I don' t have any time.
And now, lift both legs high into the air.
All right, then.
Just one last time, then you take it upstairs.
Lift those legs!
Back and forth.
One, and two, and three, and four.
Come on, you can do it.
Lift both legs high into the air.
Lift them left and right.
Come on, you can do it.
Lift those legs high into the air.
And dance!
Get your rear into gear.
Now, don' t stop until you' re ready to drop.
Now you' re cookin '!
You don' t want any bumps on the surface.
I recommend a medium grade paper because... if you use a sandpaper that' s too fine, you' re gonna be at it all day.
Now, whatever you do, do not use a metal file... because that will shred the surface to a pulp.
Either that, or it' s German.
Use short, light strokes, and watch out for surface abrasions.
These things take time.
I want him.
Magoo is goin 'down!
- You hear me?
- What?
after you finish drilling, you want to make sure that you squirt some caulk into those holes.
There' s something very important we need to talk about.
Waldo, Waldo.
I thought this was my little secret.
Then it' s true!
Yes, and a lot of people are in for a big surprise.
- Have you gone insane?
- Yes!
- You have gone insane.
Insane with passion.
Their names are even the same:
- Prunella?
Oh, oh, oh, you' re talk...
That' s wonderful, Unc.
It' s time that you met this glorious thief... who has stolen my heart.
Uh, I' il be right back.
Prunella!
He did do it.
There you are, my Viking princess.
I want you to meet someone.
Not now.
I can' t wait any longer, Quincy.
I' m gonna ask you once, and only once.
Ah, you' re going to propose!
Oh, my precious bonbon.
You know what I came here for.
Give it to me.
You' re so direct.
Now what is this?
Oh, we' ve been playing fetch all day with this.
All right, boy, go ahead.
Hold it!
Unc, who is this?
Uh, Waldo Magoo, this is, uh, Prunella Pagliacci.
I' m FBl.
That man just stole the Star of Kuristan.
Stole?
- Get up.
- What?
The eggplant mobile.
This way.
Stop or I' il shoot.
- Don' t worry.
He' s not gonna get away.
Get out of the way!
- Ah, yeah, all right.
- No, over there, over there.
I see him.
- He' s turning left.
- Left it is.
He' s turning right.
Big truck!
That won' t work!
- You' re not getting away.
- That' s the wrong car.
Don' t worry, my boy.
We' il catch him on the turnaround.
Hold on, Angus!
- Stop!
Don' t panic, now.
We' re only in some kind of tunnel.
Brakes!
Those speed bumps.
I' il sue this city.
You were saying?
Yeah, uh, uh, FBl.
I, I' m...
I' m an undercover agent... for the government.
Does this mean no story in "The Opera News"?
I' m sorry I had to deceive you.
That' s what I' ve been trying to tell you.
They, they what?
That burglar in your house was really a notorious jewel thief... who works for a man named Austin Cloquet.
The bureau has learned that Cloquet plans to sell the jewel... tomorrow at a secret auction up at a ski lodge.
Every billionaire gangster in the world is coming... except the most powerful of them all:
Ortega Peru, The Piranha.
He never goes anywhere.
So if we could get someone to impersonate Peru... we could get close to the gem and recover it.
But who?
We lost him right here, and Magoo didn' t return home all night.
Why is he always one step ahead of me?
Kenyawa Tambe just charged some tickets to a ski resort.
Yeah, so what?
Kenyawa Tambe is one of Luanne' s aliases.
- Why didn' t you tell me this before?
- Oh really?
You know, we' re supposed to be working as a team here.
- You' re going around behind my back.
- You' il take over!
- Sirs!
No.
Young lady, this is strictly a job for professionals.
Then why are the two of you going?
Welcome to the Rockies, gentlemen.
If you' il follow me to the limo, I' il take you to Austin Cloquet.
Who the hell are you?
Ortega Peru.
What' s it to you?
Mr Peru never goes anywhere.
That' s right.
I never go anywhere.
So when I go somewhere, everyone thinks I am nowhere... when I' m really there.
Now, let' s put this show on the road.
Mr Peru, uh, this way.
There are no signs.
So you' ve been staking out my uncle all this time.
Is that right?
That' s my job.
And the way you say you feel about him, is, is that part of your job, too?
You all right, boy?
You saw this man?
Yeah.
Said his name was Ortega Peru.
Magoo is Peru?
Magoo, The Piranha.
This is big.
We' re gonna need some backup.
Don' t you know how to open a door?
Gentlemen, thank you all for coming.
We' re especially honoured today to have with us Mr Ortega Peru.
I was going to kill someone this morning... but I did it last night so that I could be here.
Well, you' re too kind.
Thank you.
What do they mean?
I tattoo his portrait on my body.
What do you do when you run out of room?
Stop killing people?
Hey, I bet Peru' s got some pretty nice tattoos.
You hombres, uh, go on ahead.
I have got to use the, uh, powder room.
Well, now that we' re all here, may I have your attention, please.
This is where our little adventure began.
Gentlemen, may I present... the Star of Kuristan.
The auction will commence when you write down your opening bids.
Uh, I do not pass my cash... until I get a close look at the dingus.
Give it to me in my hand.
Mr Peru?
Your frog is leaking.
Gentlemen.
We have an impostor.
Mr Peru is Mr Magoo.
Why would Peru disguise himself as Magoo?
Shut up, you idiot, and get him!
Keep your distance!
This hepcat has a black belt in mayhem.
Hold it!
Give me the Star of Kuristan.
The Star is mine!
Prunella!
Get out.
Come on, go!
By gum, you almost had me fooled.
Unc, watch out.
She' s got a gun.
Of course she has, Waldo!
She' s a federal agent.
She' s not what you think!
Now, Waldo, you' re talking about the woman who saved my life.
Yeah, well, nobody' s perfect.
Oh, you can' t tell me that yesterday meant nothing to you.
I am a Viking A lusty, trusty Viking
Yesterday sucked.
And you kissed a carp.
Prunella.
- Give me the jewel!
- This is all you ever wanted?
You' re a true gentleman, and there aren' t many of those left.
Too bad you had to go and get in my way.
All right, I got the gun now.
Halt or I' il fire!
Don' t shoot!
Waldo!
Great Scott!
Waldo, she' s bamboozled me!
She, she, she, she, she' s a, a sneak.
That' il be easier with your clothes on.
Oh, yeah, clothes.
Oh, yes, yes, clothes.
- Police!
- Let' s beat it!
- Hold it!
- Keep your hands up!
- Come with me.
Get that man!
Hold it!
You' il just have to wait your turn.
- She' s over there!
- Where?
There!
It' s all over.
- Balderdash, Waldo!
It ain' t over until we' ve cleared our good name.
A snowboard.
After her, my boy!
- Wait, Unc, no!
- It' s as easy as pie!
That' s the wrong kind of board!
Hold it!
- Hold on, Angus!
- Stupak, go after them!
The women' s boarder cross final is about to begin.
Ready, set, go!
Get back here, you Jezebel!
I' il catch you, Prunella!
And the winner of the women' s boarder cross final is a man!
On an ironing board.
Hold it right there!
Ah, a detour.
I' il get you, Prunella!
Freeze!
Watch out!
What?
Unc?
Unc!
Are you all right?
Don' t take that detour, Waldo!
Stay right there.
We' il be right down.
Come on, buddy.
There' s some footprints down there!
They went that way!
Come on!
This is a good idea, Waldo.
You' re the real McCoy.
A true Magoo.
I want Magoo.
Luanne Le Seur and Mr Magoo.
Yes, we' re talking best- seller.
- I can' t believe they did it.
That' s the title!
Now, we just have to check the airports and search all the hotels... and make sure they don' t get away.
Senor Peru.
One moment, my darling.
The Star of Kuristan is ready for delivery.
You have 15 million?
Of course.
It will make a fitting gift for my fiancee.
- We are to be married this weekend.
Good.
The Star of Kuristan.
Do you have a Luanne Le Seur registered here?
I' il be with you in a moment.
If you' d just sign here.
- Now, who did you want?
Is she registered here?
See, we got an airline late- luggage delivery... but the party' s not staying at our hotel, so we' re checking.
I see.
What hotel are you with?
The St. Paul.
I see.
It says "Fantasy World Costume Rental."
Haven' t they let you out a little before Halloween?
- Oh, thank you, young man.
Have a good afternoon, madam.
Now, stop that.
Unc, let' s get out of here.
He' s onto us.
- Let go.
- Angus, no!
- Great Scott!
Unhand that woman, Angus.
Hey, lady, you forgot your stuff.
What' s that?
Prunella Pagliacci?
That woman is an impostor.
- Unc, that was Luanne Le Seur.
- Well, there, you see?
That' s why Angus went after her.
Great Scott!
Oh, good dog, Angus.
Good dog.
Why would she go to Brazil?
- She' s going to Peru.
- She' d go to Brazil to go to Peru?
- Exactly.
- But why?
To get more for the ruby.
- Peru?
- But then why go to Brazil?
- Peru is in Brazil.
- Peru is in Brazil?
Ortega Peru!
And that' s why we' re going to Brazil.
Come on, Waldo.
Unc, I, I think this is the place.
Attaboy, Waldo.
I like your badge.
I' m going on ahead.
You stay here.
I' m gonna eyeball the situation.
Unc, um, m- maybe I should do the eyeballing.
Father.
Maybe we should leave out the bit about "till death do us part."
- She' s nervous enough already.
Luanne Le Seur is here, Jefe.
Javier, after Rosita and I go to EuroDisney... have the Le Seur woman killed, but quietly.
If you disturb my guests, I will be very disappointed.
Monkey bars.
Must be a children' s playground.
Hello, little girl.
Did I interrupt you in your afternoon nappy?
Now, now, we mustn' t let the grown- ups know that we' re here.
Now here' s something sweet, a chocolate.
You go ahead.
Now, you go on back to sleep.
There you are, honey.
You' re the ugliest child I' ve ever seen.
And needs a change of diaper, too.
Hold on.
So, you know...
Well, where did she go?
Can' t sit still for a second.
Ah, well, I think she' s run off there... where she can have her chocolate in private.
I will gain entry to the house through a window.
You keep an eye on the lawn party and spot Luanne Le Seur if you can.
- Unc, it' s not me.
L, I...
Now, please.
Now, what you have to do is...
Great Scott!
Step on it, Unc!
Go back!
Come on!
Good boy.
Unc, there' s Luanne.
Now, I' il nab him.
You keep your eye on Le Suer, but don' t forget:
She' s smart, dangerous, ruthless, soft, beautiful, a good kisser...
Yeah, all right, all right.
Keep your eye open for pitfalls.
Senorita Le Seur, at last we meet.
- Do you have the 15 million?
It may take them time to count.
Please stay for the wedding.
Afterwards, I will have Javier take care of you.
Do it quietly and don' t disturb the guests... or I' il be very disappointed.
Kid, are you lost?
I was looking for the pool.
- Ooh, pretty, yes?
- Okay.
Hello?
Time for a little Red Cross here, Magoo.
Let me see.
Oh, my dear child!
You should have your dentist file down those teeth.
Darling?
Are you with no clothes on?
Is everything all right?
I' m crazy with the love, mi amor.
I will see you soon, my precious flower.
Before we take our sacred vows, precious one, I have a surprise.
So do I!
Adios, amor.
Nuevo nacho.
I' ve never loved you.
- Get him!
- Out of the way!
Waldo?
Unc, help!
Over here!
- Unc, that thing' s down here.
- Good Lord!
- The rope, Unc, get the rope.
- Magoo!
This is the rope that can save the boy.
All right, let' s have at it.
I will exchange the ruby for the rope.
Of course, take it.
But help me with the boy.
You know, I should have you killed, but I admire a family man.
- You' il be safe in a minute, Waldo.
- Ready.
- Good luck.
Hold on there, Waldo.
Helicopter!
Magoo has brought police!
It' s that way!
- Attaboy, Angus.
Whoa!
Pull!
- Good, Angus.
He' s escaping that way!
No one escapes Magoo.
There goes the bride.
You' d think Peru could' ve done better than that.
Magoo' s dog!
Let' s get him!
You weren' t leaving without me, were you?
Hold your horses!
- Unc!
- Arrest him!
Call the chopper!
We have to stop him!
Show me the ruby.
Get back!
Crime never pays, my boy.
Could you pull over?
I' d like to get off.
Ortega Peru, you are under arrest!
Land your helicopter now!
Don' t panic.
We' re dropping down a raft.
Swim toward the raft.
Hurry up.
Swim toward the raft.
We are dropping you a line.
- Got you now, missy.
Stay calm.
Hook it to the raft.
Quincy, please, give me the jewel.
You and me together...
Luanne Le Seur, you have the heart of an artichoke.
Stop wasting time!
You' re headed for a waterfall.
Great Scott!
We' re safe now.
It' s hooked to the raft.
Well, look at that rainbow, Magoo.
You just might be a leprechaun.
La Cascada de Muerte, the Falls of Death... where many a bride left stranded at the alter... has jumped to her final...
Aye!
- W- Well, I' m, I' m all right.
I' m, I' m fine.
Oh, that' s the spirit, dear.
You' il find someone else.
It' s inner beauty that counts.
Words of wisdom, my dear.
Words of wisdom.
Magoo, you' ve done it again.
Have a good day.
Who are you?
I am Simone Deculaat, the wedding caterer.
Oh, you' il love prison, Simone.
Hey, hey, hey, come here.
Get a picture.
How' s my hair look?
Waldo, thank you.
Oh, you' re welcome.
What will you do now?
You' re looking at the head of security.
I suppose you would not be willing to return to Kuristan with me.
In a heartbeat.
Well, you don' t have to.
I like it here much better.
Um, sorry we, uh, put you through all that.
Would you autograph this for us?
By Jove!
A- And a very good likeness of me, too, I must say.
You boys certainly move fast.
Quite right.
Always keep moving.
Come on, Angus.
Have a good day.
Well, Angus, it looks like it' s just you and me now.
Don' t take this wrong, but I feel that there' s someone out there... the perfect somebody just for me... and someday Cupid is gonna fire into the heart of the bull' s- eye.
And this is one steep staircase.
Good exercise for an old dinosaur like me.
Indeed!
Oh, by Jupiter!
Oh, Magoo, you' ve done it again!
Pardon me, madam.
Oh, Magoo, you dog!
Shut up, you dumb bitch!
You' re out of here!
Jocke...
If I hear a peep out of you, I am going to kill your mother!
Mum...
This hag seems to be utterly dead.
He' s screaming like crazy.
Then we found a note that says "forgive me" or some shit.
What do you want us to do?
Wait for the ambulance and the backup.
You pissed all over me!
Sieg heil!
Sieg heil!
Racist!
Forever!
Nazi!
Forever!
Come on, he' s just a child.
Sit the fuck down!
Remember the guy I hooked up with?
What a novice.
He didn' t even dare hold my hand.
Three strokes and he' d cum.
Maybe he was just shy.
Shy my arse.
Want to go to H& M?
I saw the cutest panties there.
"I saw the cutest panties in H& M.
Let' s go there. "
Who invited you, faggot?
Watch your mouth or I' il crush your skull.
Who do you think we are?
You haven' t got much to show.
Easy.
What are you saying, twat?
Nerd.
Sieg heil!
Sieg heil!
Watch out, you friggin 'whore!
It' s those damned skinheads.
Is that Lasse?
What' s he doing?
What are you doing, Nazi pig?
Shut up or I' il fuck you, Paki.
You shut up!
Tell me you' re a whore!
Damned skinheads!
You bloody...
Fucking coward.
No!
Come on.
Jocke!
Fuck!
Jocke!
Helen?
Could you give me a hand?
Shit, you scared me.
Lift her up carefully.
Easy now.
Wake up, Helen.
The cops!
I' il find somewhere else to crash.
You can sleep in my room.
It' s quiet in there.
I got a bit of a cut.
Get your mum to bandage it.
Jocke, you want a swig?
I' m good.
It warms your entire body.
Ray will spend the night here.
Ray will spend the night here.
Who nicked my Armani shirt?
I don' t know.
You don' t think I can smell the glue?
Sara, you' d better not be sniffing it.
I told you to quit doing that.
It fries you brain.
I haven' t been sniffing any.
It was Kenat up by the drugstore.
He made Petra either sniff some glue or take a shot of horsch.
Yeah, horse.
The next time he bothers you, just tell him I' il cut his throat.
I can take care of myself.
Yes, I can see that.
But the next time you touch my shirts...
You have so many.
What the hell is that?
Who' s that lying in my bed?
Why, that' s Tiipa, our neighbour.
Poor thing has a drinking problem.
Why did you put him in my bed?
Tell him to go lie in a trash can where he belongs.
As if you give a shit.
You have to get up.
We' re going to bed.
But we haven' t finished the film.
Come on, Petra.
It' s time to wake the hell up.
Get out of here.
Check out these tits.
That' s silicone.
Anyone can see that.
They' re hard as a rock.
I wonder who gets to do these chicks?
The guys with money.
The guys who have cash.
This watch is pretty neat.
Patek Chillip.
No, it' s called Patek Phillippe.
Alex has one of those.
Real expensive.
But he' s got no class.
That goddamned drunkard.
I' d cut off his cock.
They ought to offer rewards for his kind.
Then I' d volunteer.
Our Lord, heavenly Father.
We confess that we are unfortunately but poor, miserable sinners, and that we have no good in us.
For our hearts, flesh and blood have been so corrupted that we can never free ourselves of that evil desire.
Hence, dear Father, we ask you to forgive us our sins.
Jocke, you' re late for class.
It' s a live show?
Did I miss much?
No, he' s just getting fired up.
Yes, that was Palm Sunday in the Swedish hymn book.
Does anyone know a hymn by heart?
If you won' t give us a proper class, I' il tell the headmaster.
Let' s just take it easy now.
Banana Jan, can' t you strip for us like you did at the school party?
Oh, okay.
"Then I opened my eyes, and there he stood."
"Long blond hair and pretty eyes.
Has my prince finally arrived? "
Hey, sis.
What the hell are you doing?
"I opened my eyes and gazed into his, and I was lost in the wonderful land of love."
What the hell is this?
"He took my little hand and said:
'Hi there, my name is Jocke. "'
Never mind.
He' s in your school.
So it' s that bastard?
I' il kick his nasty, little rat dick up his fucking conk.
He' d kick your arse.
What are you talking about?
You' re sick.
Is Magne in?
Why?
Remember what I told you about that brat.
Saucy sister.
What?
I didn' t mean to...
You didn' t mean to what?
Go ahead and fuck her.
Better you than that bastard Jocke.
Are these friends of yours?
What' s going on?
Your daughter is becoming a harlot.
What in God' s name are you doing?
What in God' s name are you doing?
Didn' t you see the red light?
Are you the deputy headmaster?
I' m the father of Gusten Eriksson.
I simply demand that Joakim Vanås and Ray Lopez will be expelled.
I want them out of my son' s class.
At this school we have a certain moral standard.
Listen: burglary and vandalism.
Three instances of assault.
Another burglary.
Multiple larcenies.
Threats against an official.
This is confidential information from the social authorities.
Where did you get it?
Never mind that.
But I have quite a few contacts.
This other kid doesn' t even have a guardian.
He has the authorities.
I find it reprehensible that such a bunch of layabouts are allowed to mingle with conscientious youngsters.
What about your own son?
He smokes pot.
Well, I' il be damned.
Are you blaming my son now?
You force him to mix with this kind of dregs.
If I were you, I' d be very careful with documents such as these.
The Official Secrets Act is no joke.
I will shun no means to get you.
What do you mean by that?
I happen to know that you have quite a few skeletons in the cupboard that you may not want to appear on public display.
We fully agree.
I' il fetch the boys, and then we' il go see the headmaster.
What the hell are you doing, man?
Why, he' s not a man, he' s a faggot.
Shut up, you brats.
Now.
You' re in real deep shit now.
I have some pot on me.
Hand it to me.
What' s going on?
I' il leave this in my locker.
What have you got there?
Let me see.
Take it easy.
Can I see what you' ve got in your bag?
Do you live in your locker?
You want to move in, you damn Paki?
Come along now.
Jocke, honey.
What the hell are you doing here?
She' s boozed up.
That' s none of your business.
I wish I were drunk.
I can' t find my way around here.
Give your mum a hug now.
Stop it, mum.
Stop being so disgusting.
You stink!
I' ve summoned you to this meeting because of a police report concerning a brawl that took place on a subway station downtown.
I found it appropriate to summon the students in question along with their parents to discuss their behaviour.
What a load of crap.
They should be in reform school.
Gustav, sit down.
Look at him.
My son tells me that these delinquents force him to do...
... all sorts of devilry!
This school is way too lenient.
Yes, but the purpose of this meeting was to discuss the matter.
A damned meeting isn' t enough.
Action is what counts.
You either expel those punks, or I will make use of my contacts.
And then, by God...
Take it easy.
Shut up, you son of a bitch.
Why do you call my son that?
Pipe down, you moaner.
Go home and wear a dress.
Let' s not get carried away.
What do you know about that?
This is no school.
It' s an institution for the education of delinquents and punks.
The important thing is to listen to each other.
If we don' t, how can we solve our conflicts?
I demand action.
I' ve listened enough to you two.
In situations like this people have to listen to each other.
That' s the basic premise for solving conflicts.
Drop them.
Is it exciting?
Are they worth shagging?
Look at that.
Is anything happening?
That wasn' t much of a party.
This is damn good pot.
I bought some for the party tonight.
What party?
There' s a huge party tonight.
I' m going.
This stuff isn' t bad at all.
Where did you get it?
He' s my contact.
He told me about a clothes warehouse we can plunder.
They have no alarm system.
I' m off.
It' s too smoky in here.
Say "hi" to your mum.
What kind of clothes is it?
It' s the greatest.
It' s some sports clothes wholesaler.
He' s got Nike and Champion.
Is it somewhere in town?
There are more coming.
What' s he doing in here?
I didn' t know he fancied chicks.
Is it a homo show?
What the hell?
What a couple of jerks.
Poofters.
That' s nasty.
Hold on.
What is it?
Quiet.
You' re so gross.
Get him out.
What a stinker.
Hold on.
I need to take a piss.
Christ, you' re so gross.
Come on.
Hi there.
You fucking bastard!
God damn it.
Take it easy.
Do we just kill each other and leave?
Come on.
Nice, Andy.
I like the way you parry with your nose.
Seriously, take it easy.
Are you okay?
Sure.
I' il go take a shower.
Remember when I KO' d Tyson?
Gurra enters.
The audience is expectant.
And I move forward and smack...
Your money, Swedish pig.
Give it up or I' il fuck you.
And your mum.
You got lucky.
The next time I' il cut your throat.
Hi.
Hi.
Always with your left hand!
You got that, boy?
Is that brunette coming?
Are you horny?
What brunette?
The one with the nice rack.
Where' s Andy?
At home changing his diaper.
Yes!
I' d love to smash that fuck.
No, stay away from them.
It' s good they' re here.
The Nazis are coming.
We don' t need their help.
It' s a shame Andy isn' t here.
I heard he was on his way.
"The rescue".
So, where do you live now?
Skip it, you sodding poofter.
Mike, look at that.
Get him!
Look at that.
Your prince has arrived.
She' s just waiting for you to hook up with her.
You have no sense of humour.
You think you' re Eddie Murchy?
His name is Eddie Murphy.
I know that.
I won' t see you again.
Hi.
How are you doing?
I' m fine.
It' s real good to see you.
You too.
Would you like to dance?
I haven' t got the time.
Besides, this is a shitty dance floor.
Did you see the Jacuzzi upstairs?
No.
You have to go see it.
It' s so cool.
She can wait here.
Come on.
There' s no Jacuzzi in here.
No, there isn' t.
Just a small, dirty couch.
Come on over and sit down.
Come on.
Thank you.
For that thing in the subway?
That was nothing.
Those damned skinheads.
They got a thrashing.
You were so brave.
You were.
Things like that happen.
The main thing is that we' re unscathed.
We really were lucky.
It could have been us down there.
I wonder what happened to the guy that was hit?
Disgusting.
Yes.
We' il catch him downstairs.
You' re just lying here having it off.
You think you' il get any tonight, you sad git?
Jesus, what an attitude.
She' s always like that.
To hell with her.
Did you push Ola onto the tracks?
Louder!
I can' t hear you!
Sic him!
I didn' t do it!
Louder!
I' m sorry.
That' s not what I meant.
I trust you.
You got that?
"Yet another gang killing downtown."
"The victim, Andreas Johansson, was 17 years old, and he is believed to have taken part in a gang clash Saturday night."
"His body was found on a busy street in downtown Stockholm."
"The investigation has been stopped due to a lack of resources."
What a load of crap.
What kind of dickhead comes up with this?
He wasn' t in any bloody gang.
I can' t believe it.
Jocke, the deputy headmaster has fondled Petra.
It was so disgusting.
He forced me into a broom cupboard.
Hi there.
Petra, come on and let' s sort this out.
No.
Sort what out?
This is beyond you.
What' s that supposed to mean?
I' ve waited for this a long time.
Now you' re in serious trouble.
Nice car.
The coast is clear.
It' s just cardboard.
This isn' t what he promised us.
Women' s clothes.
What the hell are you doing?
Take it easy.
Cuff them.
Take it easy!
Let' s go before the cops get here.
Let' s get out of here.
We' il do something else instead.
You haven' t got much to show.
Come and have a look.
You' re so cute.
This is the final of the 60 kilo class.
In red we have Ray Lopez and in blue Joakim Vanås.
Let go, you fuck!
Sentence will be passed in the case against Joakim Vanås, social security number 750410 0233, registered at the address Gruvvägen 32 in Tomtberga and Ray Lopez, social security number 75 10 16 379 1.
Address unknown.
The jury finds Vanås guilty of mugging according to chapter 8, paragraph 4 of the penal code.
Off you go!!
Mum?
If I hear a peep out of you, I will kill your mother!!
... will hence be imprisonment for 18 months.
You look like my mother.
Stop that.
Put a lid on it, guys.
What' s up?
That' s right, bitch.
Now I' ve got you, you snitch.
What did he do?
He ratted.
No, I know this guy.
What do you mean?
Take a hike.
Leave.
Some guys have all the luck, "pal".
How long have you known him?
For a while.
But where did you meet him?
In town.
What kind of an answer is that?
You ought to find someone else.
There is no one else.
Honey.
There must be others.
Two, Pedro.
Three.
What' s this?
Komifu.
Sure.
It' il cost you a hundred.
No problem.
Hit me.
Diamonds.
What are you serving time for?
Assaulting an official.
Things like that.
How about you?
I didn' t do my national service.
Cost me four months.
No shit?
That' s what you get.
First you bail out, then you need bail.
One should have been a criminal.
What about you?
I work here.
Drug force.
I' m unravelling the drug gang from Säffle.
That sounds weird.
Welcome to TV Paparazzi!
Give us a hand!
As usual your host is the nice, nasty and naughty DJ Rob!
We have now reached what we call "the competition".
I went to the square and found myself two size.
"Size" can refer to girls or the size of your shoes.
I don' t really know why I said that.
Ladies and gentlemen:
Helen and Marcella!
Two size who...
That' s Helen.
That' s my girlfriend.
Saucy chick.
I thought you were gay.
So, what do you do?
Go to school or a recreation centre?
Can I get a laugh?
Thank you.
DJ Rob is always such fun.
Helen, who is working extra at Tabu.
Yes, the audience is always alert in Paparazzi.
We have come to what we call the competition with a capital "C".
Marcella, what would you do if a guy stuck his hand up your dress?
Push it away, of course.
Can we get a "boo"?
What' s this?
Helen, if somebody with no forewarning...
If somebody kissed you on the lips, what would you do?
I' il count down:
Five, four, three, two...
Give me a hand!
Don' t turn off the bloody telly.
You fucking homo.
Hi.
What a horrible trip.
I can imagine.
I didn' t tell mum that I went here.
That' s probably for the best.
This is my girlfriend, Helen.
Jocke, have you got a fag?
No.
Buy some yourself.
Tony is my name.
Don' t you forget that.
Let' s take a seat.
How are you doing?
I' ve missed you.
Ray told me to say "hi".
He' s coming to pick you up.
What' s wrong?
Are you upset?
I saw a slut on TV.
I saw you making out.
I' m in prison, and you screw around with all kinds of celebrities.
How do you think that feels?
But it was the host.
You' re acting like a fucking whore.
It was a mistake.
It was a mistake to even come here!
You can just bugger off.
I don' t need you.
But I can explain.
You' ve messed up!
That' s not what happened at all.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Tony, I want you to meet one of my buddies.
He' s so frigging great.
Let' s go see him.
We' il go and see the lad.
Don' t forget about it.
Keep it in mind.
I won' t forget.
Have some.
That' s good.
Knock yourself out.
Do more.
Have some more.
Good.
I' il show you something pretty.
Nice, eh?
Saucy girl.
I shagged her in the arse until she burst.
Then I chewed her snatch to a pulp.
Disgusting.
This is Lisa.
She' s alright.
But her cunt reeks.
She hasn' t washed it for a year.
I like this one.
What a cool Uzi.
I bought it from a gypsy who shot seagulls with it.
Talk about a cloud of feathers.
You would, wouldn' t you?
If you stick to me, I' il get you a thousand of them.
We have great things in store.
Hell yes.
Yo, man.
Hey, Jocke.
What' s up?
Long time, no see.
No.
You' ve put on a few pounds.
I got us a car.
Someone else is here to pick me up.
But I got this so that we could get into town.
Hi, Tony.
What' s up?
This is my buddy Ray.
Who took a dump on you, brownie?
Never mind.
Who' s this idiot?
He didn' t mean anything by it.
Take it easy.
We' il drive together.
That was uncalled for.
He' s a nice guy.
So am I.
Piece of shit car.
What the hell is he doing?
We' il take this instead.
Leave.
Coke.
A thousand a gramme.
I' m a good customer.
A price is a price.
Sure.
Then it' s 1, 500 a gramme.
Forget it, then.
Okay, 1, 500.
Business is thriving.
Are you going to talk to her?
To whom?
Your girlfriend is here.
I told you, she messed up.
That fucking whore.
Not that bad?
Wåtz, that poofter.
I' il smack him if I see him.
But he' s here.
Fuck that guy.
He' s a customer.
He bought a gramme.
He' s so far out.
Have a look at this instead.
Prime shit.
It' s Peruvian.
Voila, monsieur.
Is it wild?
I' ve never done coke before.
Are you taking the piss?
You' ve never tried it, you amateur?
I was just wondering if I should do this much.
You' re taking mine as well.
Then you' il live longer.
You bloody idiot.
What the hell were you thinking?
Did it mess him up?
Sure, you keep pushing him.
I can' t work with that clown.
We grew up together.
He' s really calm.
Something big is coming up.
That deal I told you about.
I don' t want this psycho to tag along.
He' s really calm!
There she is, that fucking whore.
Relax.
What were you thinking?
Cunt.
What are you doing?
What is wrong with you?
I can see that you' re thinking.
Is it something about me?
Did you sleep with that guy?
Just tell me if you did or didn' t.
It drives me crazy thinking about it all the time.
I only want to be with you.
No one else.
Do you swear?
I swear.
And you' il never do it again?
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
I' m here to see Mike.
He' s in his office.
Guys, I' il see you inside.
Hi, Tony.
Hi there.
I hear you' re doing well.
I' m not complaining.
How are you doing?
I bought that one for you.
I' ve got a problem.
And?
You know Tamir, right?
A Pakistani who sells for me.
He owes me 40, 000.
I want to send him a little warning.
Well, 40, 000 is peanuts, but I do owe you a favour.
We' il take care of it.
I' m about to do another deal that I thought I' d let you in on.
But we' il talk about that some other time.
Do you need anything?
Just let me know.
Okay.
Hi, boys.
Look at that girl over there.
I want her.
Hi, Mike.
Mike, that girl over there...
Is she part of the deal?
See you.
Can I buy...
What are you doing here?
Mike says "hi".
Mikey.
He' s funny.
So, what did he say?
He' s got a box for you.
A box?
At the races?
What a funny guy.
What the hell are you doing?
Come here.
You owe Mike 40, 000.
Then do it now!
Here' s your fucking money.
Fuck that bastard up.
He owes me 4, 000.
Give it to me instead.
Why would I do that?
You have to pay interest.
Get the hell out of here.
It' s great to see you.
Where have you been?
Long time, no see.
Who the hell is he?
He smells.
I' m dealing horse, you know.
That pays off.
I need your help.
There' s this damn porn guy...
He owes me 20, 000.
I don' t suppose you could help me?
Let me see you get a huge hard on that you just ram in all the way.
Pure action.
If it gets flaccid, you' d better get it up in a hurry.
And then you go down on her until she comes.
I' m done with you.
Where do I blow my load?
Give me my money before you get hurt.
Have you come to show off with your new, cool friends?
I won' t pay you.
You messed up.
Give him the money, or I' il cut your throat.
Who are you?
You bloody freeloader.
Now you' re not so tough anymore.
Give him the money.
Give it to him, you pale git, or I' il plug you in the shitter.
Give it to him!
You fucking pimp.
No!
Mum?
It' s me.
Is that you, Helen?
Are you alone?
It' s Jocke and I.
Hi, honey.
How nice.
Why haven' t you called?
I' ve been worried sick.
How are you doing?
Fine, thank you.
Come on in.
I' m sorry that I' m so cautious, but there' s all sorts of odd persons coming through here.
I suppose they' re Magne' s friends.
They' re just so very odd.
I suppose I ought to call the police.
What a lovely vest.
Where did you get that?
From Jocke.
It must have cost a fortune.
Oh, and a necklace.
Dear me, it' s so beautiful.
I haven' t heard from you for weeks.
I' ve been so worried.
We' ve been with some of Jocke' s friends.
That sounds very nice.
You must have a good job.
He' s a consultant.
Some coffee?
Please.
You' ve managed well.
I can' t complain.
Magnus, is that you?
Yes.
What the hell are they doing here?
What happened to you?
What happened to your clothes?
Vagrant.
Shut your trap.
Mum, have you got 500 kroner that I can borrow?
No, not right now.
You already owe me some.
Lay off.
Pipe down.
Mum, please.
I' il pay you back Friday.
I can' t spare any money.
You can have this one as well.
Buy yourself some new clothes.
Hello.
My name is Karl Rosenberg.
I' d like to cash a check.
You have to sign on the back of it.
There?
Hand us the cash, bitch.
What' s going on?
What a disgusting place.
How the hell can you live here?
This is good stuff.
Have you smoked heroin before?
What do you need books for, junkie?
Wiping your arse?
Don' t touch my books!
Put it back!
Get your fucking hands off it!
Sure, what' s the matter with you?
Stop your gibberish.
I want to talk about the money.
How do you calculate it?
You take half of everything.
Nonsense.
We' re doing my jobs.
You' re just tagging along.
Then get some other helpers.
I want my third of this job, and then I' il turn my back on this.
Tony, we get even parts, don' t we?
Of course, the money is split evenly.
See?
But we' ve had some expenses.
But there' s a deal in the making.
What expenses?
I want my money now, you retard.
Hello?
Hi, this is Helen.
Hi there.
Can you do me a big favour?
It' s important.
We' il be there.
Don' t tell him anything.
Great.
Thanks.
That hit hard.
Do a shot of heroin.
That' il get you back on your feet.
Shit.
Get this shit out of the way.
Take it easy.
Just open the fucking door.
It' s just those crawl girls.
It' s called "call girls".
Who gives a fuck?
Get the girls in here.
Lay off, or we' il leave right away.
You have to pay no matter what.
"Lay off, or we' il leave."
Is that you, Gurra?
Did you ask that bookworm to come?
You look like shit.
What do you mean?
Have you started shooting up?
What are you talking about?
You look like crap.
You fucking cow.
Who asked those cunts to come here?
Damn it, Jocke...
Today...
Do you think he' il like it?
Sure, you look great.
It' s not embarrassing at all.
You don' t think so?
You' re asking the wrong person.
I hope you' re right.
Is he here?
I told Ray to bring him here.
You' il do fine.
It' il be fun.
Hey.
Get off your arses.
That' s it.
Crappy music.
How may I help you?
Four bottles of fizz in one hell of a hurry.
Get a move on.
And bring us some cokes as well, you tight little arse.
His horn is a bit rusty.
Go down on him and have a look.
Golly, golly, golly!
Welcome, welcome, welcome, everybody, to yet another wonderful evening at the Club Artiste.
As usual we have guest performers.
Ladies and gentlemen.
The Miss Teenage contest with twelve superhot, supersassy supercool ladies on the stage!
Let' s give them a spontaneous applause!
Come here, I' il lick you clean.
Jocke...
Jesus Christ, that' s Helen.
To hell with her.
What are you doing?
You can' t participate in a beauty contest, you whoring bitch.
Jocke!
Stop them or I' il blow your head off.
Jocke, come here, you idiot.
Cunts.
What is this?
Get out, God damn it!
I' il drive.
What the hell?
Move, damn it!
Go!
My car.
That was very childish of Jocke.
I thought he would be proud of me.
He' s just jealous.
Such as myself.
Maybe we should go out sometime.
I don' t think so.
We can' t just stand here.
Tag along, I' il buy you a drink.
I need to wash off this dye first.
I' il see you in five minutes.
Does anybody have a joint?
Keep your junkie pal in check!
Fucking psycho.
Watch the road!
Well, well, well, girls.
Now it' s time to get tipsy.
Helen, chin up.
How about a fixer upper?
Just juice.
And how about you, Hotlips?
No thanks, uncle.
Just ice water.
"Just ice water".
You' il never become models, that' s for sure.
Benke?
Four ice water and an Explorer 75 for me, Benke.
Why did you pull your gun?
It was you amateurs who fucked up.
Just drive, God damn it!
Drive, you sodding junkie.
Keep your eyes on the road!
Go, damn it!
Go!
Stop yelling at him.
Are you afraid or what?
I just love this track.
Come on, let' s dance.
Fucking junkie pig.
The cops are dogging us.
Are you scared or what?
You should keep track of your whore.
This is all her fault!
Just go!
I can hear the cops, but where the hell are they?
Drive!
This is a bloody cul de sac.
Relax.
What the hell are you doing?
You can' t drive on the railway track!
You look so tired, little girl.
A swig of water will buck you up.
Now, doesn' t that feel much better?
He' s dead.
Gurra?
To hell with him.
Let' s move.
Gurra?
We have to leave.
Jocke...
Helen, pick it up, damn it.
You were too hard on him.
He was just a fucking junkie.
We grew up together.
And my cat died when I was four.
Is Helen there?
At this hour?
Helen has disappeared.
Take some rohypnols.
Helen has disappeared.
Sure, but we' re in a hurry now.
We have to go get the car and finish our deal.
We' il pick her up at Galaxy.
No, the cops are going to be there.
Come on, damn it!
Come on!
Everything is alright.
Are you scared or what?
Here they come.
How can you trust a psycho like that?
This is so wrong.
He looks so psyched out.
Let' s go out together.
Hold on.
I' ve dealt with him before.
Stay in the car.
I' d better go out there myself.
I' m just saying...
This really isn' t looking good.
Hey there.
Have you brought the coke?
No.
What do you mean "no"?
What kind of bullshit is this?
She is at our mercy so we want more money.
Instead of 200, 000 for 500 grammes we want 200, 000 for 100 grammes.
That' s not going to happen.
No coke, no deal.
You hear me?
Helen.
That' s Jockes little cunt.
Screw her.
They' il fuck us over, I swear they will.
Then there' il be hell to pay.
Very well, maybe the two of us can strike a deal here.
But it will have to stay between us.
I have to get a few things done.
I' il call you, alright?
Where the hell is the coke?
He didn' t have all of it.
A week?
We' ve got to get our shit.
Yes, but we have to wait another week.
It' s okay.
I certainly hope so.
Everything' s okay.
Guys, come on.
I' m so tired of this shit.
You understand?
Then why don' t you quit?
What do you mean?
Are you some kind of gay or what?
Look at this crappy life we' re living.
Here we are, sitting here like two disgusting junkies.
I' m tired of this shit.
Listen to yourself.
It' s a vicious circle.
You never were a true friend anyway.
I can' t take it anymore.
I want out of this shit.
Then bugger off.
Helen?
Helen?
Helen?
But it' s you.
Why are you here?
Let me explain.
You have to help me.
It' s Helen.
What' s with Helen?
Where is she?
Mike has her.
I' il kill you!
No.
Mike' s the one who' s taken her.
If anything happens to Helen, I will cut off your cock.
Will you help me get her back?
I' ve also been fucked over.
I know what they' re up to.
Mike and Tony will fuck you over, too.
Mike demands a ransom for Helen.
Tony wants Helen for himself.
You know that' s true.
Do you know where she is?
I know where they' il do it.
What the hell is this?
So, now you' re doing deals on your own?
Hold on a second.
Who' s got the power now?
All of this is mine!
Get it?
All of this is mine!
Who' s got the power now?
I' il shoot him.
Stay out of this.
Who' s got the power now?
You cowardly bastard.
No...
Mike!
You stay right here!
No!
No!
Helen?
By:
Summer06
Ahh, the famous Genovian pear and cheese dessert.
What else?
You are nothing but an overdressed, drunken --
I' m outta here!
I am sopping!
Was that my fault?
Shall we adjourn to the grand hall for coffee?
Sorry I let you down, Dad.
Good night, Louie.
This place was such a mess when I first arrived.
I' ve been spending every spare moment in it I can.
Pick up one of these.
Make yourself useful.
Spray everything.
You' re not mad at me for what happened?
Actually, I found it rather funny.
Reminds me of my first royal dinner party.
I accidentally knocked over a suit of armor... and the spear went right through the suckling pig.
Amelia, why don' t we cancel lessons for today... and just have some fun?
Fun?
You' re not too busy for something like that?
Your Majesty, Lady Jerome has arrived... and I have the French Consulate' s assistant on hold.
He wants to confirm tonight' s dinner.
Send my apologies.
Cancel everything for today.
I' m being shown San Francisco... by a true San Franciscan.
Tell Joseph I' il need the car.
Yes, ma' am.
I want to show you my baby.
I haven' t sat in the front seat of a car... in the longest time.
By the way... thanks for the money for my car, Grandma.
So, where are you taking me?
Well, do you have any change?
It' s not appropriate for royalty to jingle.
I' il get the change.
This one' s my favorite!
You put the quarter in and grab his hand.
I touch that?
Yes, you touch that.
And then you just go.
Looks like Rupert' s cousin... from Liechtenstein.
How do I know when it' s ready?
Oh, it' il just go.
There you go!
You enjoy this humiliation?
Well, it' s hard the first time... but you can do it again.
Hold this.
You can do it, Grandma!
I' m ready for you this time!
Ready?
It' s going!
Go, go, go, go, go!
You' re doing it!
Oh, yes!
Ho!
Give me five!
- Five?
- Five.
I want one of these!
Just not this one.
So... did my father always want to be a prince?
Oh, yes.
Except once, about 15 years ago... he seriously considered renouncing his title... because he met a lovely artist... who showed him wonderful things... about how life could be... how he could be.
But?
But he had a decision to make... and nobody could make it for him.
Not I -- though many people thought I did -- or anybody else.
Phillipe knew that my firstborn... his brother Pierre, wanted to abdicate... which he did, eventually, to join the church.
Your father realized... that the love he could have for one person -- or even two -- could not make him forget the love... he felt for his country and its people.
It was the hardest thing he ever had to do.
Do you want a bite of this?
Why not?
Well, here goes.
Why, it' s delicious!
- Mm- hmm.
Oh, OK!
Let' s get another one!
It' s the fastest way back to the Consulate... but I hate this hill!
I do believe I' m beginning to feel that corn dog.
Maybe you can just sneak gently through?
- OK, I' il try.
- Good.
CLARlSSE:
Now, blaze on up.
I -- I got it!
- You' ve got it.
- I got it!
You' ve got it!
Oh!
I haven' t got it!
Mia!
Brake!
Look out!
Down here!
9- 1- 1, I need to report an accident.
You didn' t hear the bell?!
They put me on hold.
Oh, for the love of God!
Put down destruction of public property.
I will, I will.
And last, but not least... driving without a license.
Accompanied by an adult whose license expired... 45 years ago.
Licenses don' t expire in Genovia.
Not for the queen.
Don' t I have diplomatic immunity?
You do, but her we have to take downtown.
What?
I' m sorry, miss.
I understand.
I...
I understand perfectly.
You do?
Mia, no town, no city, no country... can function peacefully... if its officers and its transportation engineers... don' t follow the letter of the law.
Why, I would be proud... to have two such fine, honorable gentlemen... serving in Genovia.
Aw, shucks, ma' am.
Ma' am, we' re not all that.
Oh, but you most certainly are.
I would like to bestow upon you... the honor of the...
Genovian Order of the... uh... Genovian Order of the Rose.
Would you please kneel?
Um... does anybody have a sabre?
I' ve got an umbrella!
I have an emergency brake.
This will do fine, thank you.
I dub thee --
Artie Washington, San Francisco, ma' am.
And I dub thee --
Bruce Macintosh of San Leandro.
Bruce Macintosh... masters of the Order of the Rose.
And all of you bear witness... to this auspicious moment in history.
Please rise.
Wait till I go home and tell Bernice.
Now, Mia, I know you don' t want to go... all the way downtown, but --
That really won' t be necessary.
No one got hurt, did they?
- We' re insured.
- OK.
Chivalry ain' t dead, you know, so --
Noble Arthur, how very kind.
OFFlCER:
Oh, that would be very helpful, thank you.
Come along, Mia.
Good- bye, trolley people!
Please take the car to Doctor Motors?
- Good- bye!
- So long!
Good- bye!
Good- bye.
You were awesome!
You are the coolest queen ever!
All in a day' s work.
Wave good- bye!
That' s a queen!
Would you like to slide in first?
I never slide.
Good- bye.
Thank you.
Good- bye!
How about getting on your royal carriage... and getting us out of here?
This is the possible new Princess of Genovia here.
Anyone know where Genovia is?
It' s a country between France and Spain.
That was a question on "Jeopardy."
This is the girl that won the genetic lottery.
TOUR KlD:
Here' s the princess!
Let' s go.
The princess is late for school.
Could you sign my backpack?
Hi, Princess.
May I have your autograph, please?
What' s your name?
Lilly.
Lilly?
That' s my best friend' s name.
Would you consider you and the princess best friends?
I would definitely say that.
We do everything together.
We even finish Reach other' s sentences.
It' s very cool.
And what' s your name?
Charlotte.
Charlotte?
You two must be twins, huh?
CHARLOTTE:
I don' t have any sisters... but I do have a cat -- Fat Louie.
That' s a funny name!
Will you take a picture with me, Princess?
The princess is late for algebra.
Thank you so much.
The pack is back.
Are you ready?
Mia.
Hi... hi.
Step into my office.
Hey.
Hi.
I hope what Lana said on TV... didn' t freak you out too much.
- No.
- OK, good.
Because I broke up with her because of it... and I hate phony publicity seekers.
Saturday night' s the big beach party.
I think it' d be cool if we went together.
See you on the waves?
OK.
[Laughs]
P. A.:
Remember to watch Grove High School' s TV cable show...
Saturday nights with your host Lilly Moscovitz.
Michael.
Princess.
You will never guess what Josh Bryant just asked me.
"Can I borrow a comb?"
No.
He asked me... to go to the Baker Beach Party with him.
That' s this Saturday, right?
I could come by the garage next week... and listen to your band play then.
Oh, yeah.
That' s -- Yeah.
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I' m fine.
All right.
Well, I have to go... but thank you so much.
Bye!
Bye.
Is Joseph driving you?
MlA:
Joseph was nice enough... to take the night off.
I' il take the school bus with the other kids.
I look like an asparagus.
But a very, very cute asparagus.
I' il just wear my blue suit.
Are you nervous about the beach party?
No.
Actually, I' m kind of excited.
I think I might get my first real kiss.
- Oh!
Who from?
- Josh Bryant.
That Backstreet Boy clone you' ve had a crush on forever?
He is not a Backstreet Boy clone.
He' s a sailor.
I thought he was never nice to you.
I don' t know.
He is now.
I just hope that if he kisses me... um... my foot pops.
Pops?
You know, in old films... whenever a girl gets seriously kissed... her foot would just kind of... pop.
Pop!
I' m gonna go change now.
I hope you get your first real foot- popping kiss.
We are Mark and Brian... and welcome to the Baker Beach Bash.
Now, with one week left of school... you' re gonna be out for the summer... and we know what' s on your mind.
How are you gonna find that summer love?
And if you do, how do you know if it' s true?
Lana and the Lanettes!
Lana, Anna, and Fontana!
That was so --
- Awesome, huh?
- Amazing!
I' m glad you had fun.
'cause most of the girls I take on the boat... they freak out.
I wasn' t scared.
And now it' s time for your favorite talk show host... direct from Grove High School... the lovely Lilly.
It' s Saturday night... and welcome to my cable show, "Shut Up and Listen."
I will be joined by our very own Princess Mia... to discuss her positive opinion... of the "Save the Sea Otter" movement.
I' ve asked Grove' s magic master...
Jeremiah Hart... to entertain us with some sleight of hand.
Hello, folks.
Awesome!
Hey, Princess!
Give us a smile!
How did they find me here?
What?
How did they find me here?!
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Hey, wave, everybody!
You' re on TV!
Wait, Princess, don' t be shy!
Come back!
Hey, chopper boy, look over here!
Royal deejays!
Josh!
I am so sorry about all this.
No, it' s fine.
They can' t get us in here.
We were having such a good time... and then they came and ruined it.
Look, they can' t see us... we can' t see them.
We' re all alone in this little shack.
Actually, you know what?
It' s kind of cozy in here... and there' s no one I' d rather be here with than you.
Really?
Yeah.
- Mm- hmm?
This isn' t romantic.
It' s caught in a volleyball net.
Here.
Hey!
My dad thinks I' m a princess!
I' m a friend of Mia' s!
While we' re waiting... how about a foot massage?
Thank you.
Actually, I mean you give me one.
Oh, yeah.
And indeed, it is the queen of hearts!
Thank you, Jeremiah... for your potpourri of prestidigitations... for the past hour.
Obviously, Princess Mia has a problem... appearing here tonight... and I' m sure she has a good excuse.
I' m Lilly Moscovitz for "Shut Up and Listen."
Thank you and good night.
Mia... the coast is clear.
Really?
Yeah.
Oh, good.
So, what do you say we go find... a more romantic spot?
OK.
Quiet!
JOSH:
Stay!
Give her a smooch!
Come on!
Give her a big, sloppy wet one!
Hold it!
Hit him again!
No, no, no!
Go away, all of you!
The princess has left the building.
Who have we got?
What' s your name?
Where do you go to school?
Josh Bryant.
I go to Grove High School.
What are we, friends with Mia now?
Yes.
We hate Josh.
Sorry.
It' s hard to keep up with who we' re not talking to.
Here she comes!
Mia!
I' m really sorry.
I can' t talk.
I have to go get my clothes.
Well, here.
We' ve got your clothes.
You' il be a lot warmer.
You guys want to help me?
Josh is such an idiot.
We' il make sure no one bothers you.
Um...
That' s really nice of you.
This is so great of you.
Thank you so much.
Everything' s fine.
- No!
- No!
Guys, I really appreciate this.
She' s got her bathing suit off.
OK, now!
Princess, hi!
That was the scream of Princess Mia.
Go away, all of you, please!
Come here, Mia.
Piranhas, all of you!
Back off!
HELEN:
My mom always told me I couldn' t cry... and told me to be a big girl... but you' ve been hurt, so you just cry.
It was really bad.
My foot didn' t even pop.
SUKl:
It was just last night... that San Francisco' s own little princess... partied at the beach... but what started out as innocent fun... soon turned into allegedly too much fun.
This is Suki Sanchez for KPFW.
Please say something.
Well, there' s not much to say.
A picture' s worth a thousand words... and you have two pictures.
I embarrassed the family, didn' t I?
Not to put too fine a point on it, yes, you did.
I think you' re making a wise decision... to abstain from the job.
I suppose I won' t come to the ball.
Of course you should come.
You' re still family.
Just because you don' t want to be our princess... doesn' t mean we' re sending you into exile.
Your mother' s planning to come.
Except for your beach friends.
I' m meeting with the press to do some damage control.
You can come in now.
If I may say so... that did not go very well.
Is this the way a princess should act?
My information tells me that boy was using her.
The kiss was merely a device... so that he could get his 15 minutes of fame.
Anna, Falana, Banana, Bandana, Montana...
I have no idea what you' re talking about.
Why didn' t she have enough common sense... to deal with this?
She' s only 15... but today, she acted beyond her years.
She showed great respect... and gracefully accepted your criticism.
You' re saying that as a queen, I was too harsh on her.
I was critical of the person... who could become the next ruler of my country.
I' m saying, as a grandmother... you might have been too harsh on your granddaughter.
Do you think she can do it?
Oh, I have no doubts, ma' am.
I thought so, too.
Hey, it' s Mia Thermopolips.
Can you autograph your picture?
Josh did.
Hey, there' s Princess Pucker- up.
Lilly?
Hey, can I talk to you for a minute, please?
Lilly, can I just talk to you for a minute?
- Is that cool?
- Sure.
Let' s talk.
But about what, hmm?
Mwah mwah mwah!
I' m sorry, OK?
I forgot to call you and tell you... that I couldn' t make it.
So I was stuck with the Happy Houdini... while you make out with the Yachting Yahoo.
Those are really good alliterations.
I don' t want to talk about alliterations!
Lilly, I came up here to tell you that I' m sorry!
I' m sorry I missed your cable show... and I' m just really sorry.
I can' t believe that you hung me up... after all I did for you.
I kept your royal secret.
And do you know how hard it is... to have a cable show and keep a secret?
You didn' t keep it a secret from me... how jerky you thought my being a princess was.
Well, congratulations.
You got your wish.
I' m not gonna be a princess.
You' re not?
No.
But I want you to be.
What?
I didn' t mean it.
The green monster of jealousy came out... because you were Miss Popular... and I thought I was losing my best friend... so I got angry and upset and hurt and...
I told you!
I need an attitude adjustment.
But the truth is... you being a princess is kind of a miracle.
No!
What miracle?
It' s a nightmare!
No!
Think about it!
I just found out that my cable show... only reaches 12 people.
Wanting to rock the world, but having zip power like me -- now, that' s a nightmare.
But you -- Wow!
What is so "Wow"?
Wow is having the power to affect change... make people listen.
How many teenagers have that power?
What more of a miracle do you want?
Not more, just different.
I' m inviting you.
I hope you' il forgive me... and I hope you come.
But what will I wear?
I don' t know, but it doesn' t really matter.
I' m just happy that you' re gonna come!
LlLLY:
And you can be a princess.
- No, I can' t.
- Yes, you can.
Move in!
Let' s go!
HARBULA:
Bobby Bad, hang up the phone!
Yes, Mom.
I' il go to the dentist after school.
I hate it when they move in like that.
Mia, it' s not a championship game.
It' s not even a big game.
It' s just gym class.
Just hit the ball.
I don' t want to flunk you in gym class.
Come on.
You can do it.
Keep your eye on the ball.
That' s OK!
You' re gonna hit it anyway!
Go, Lions!
Come on, girls.
It' s a ball, not a snake.
Back in formation!
I' m sorry.
Foul ball.
It' s all right.
You got a piece of it.
It' s OK.
HARBULA:
That' s OK!
Keep your eye on the ball.
Go, Lions!
Grr- eat!
Let' s go!
Would you rather hit a beach ball?
Order me a pizza, huh?
Pepperoni.
- All right!
Go!
I gotta go.
Get up!
What are you doing?
Get up!
All the way, Mia!
Hi, Josh.
Come on, girl!
All the way, Mia!
Come on!
Safe!
And you passed.
Mia!
HARBULA:
Way to go!
Uh... it' s open.
Come on in.
Michael!
Hi.
How are you?
- What?
- Little guy on your --
Did Lilly tell you that I called... because I... called.
I brought your car.
Oh, thank you.
Seven times I called.
Doc said that he fixed what he could... and if you had any problems, give him a call.
Oh, OK.
I have the last payment.
Thank you.
MlCHAEL:
No.
Here it is.
It' s really, really great of you.
I didn' t do it for you.
Doc lets the band practice.
Of course.
I help with the cars.
Oh, here.
Oh, thanks.
I know you' re still mad at me for blowing you off... and I' m really sorry I did.
But I am going to try to make it up to you.
How?
Well, I' m still going... to the Genovian Independence Day ball... and I' m inviting you.
It could be fun, you know.
I' m wearing this great dress that I can' t breathe in... and Lilly' s got a date.
Josh looks better in a tux.
I really want you to be the one I share it with.
You don' t have to wear a tux.
You can wear sweat pants for all I care.
Don' t worry about me.
I just consider myself royally flushed.
Stop the bovine massacre!
Sign up now and save a cow!
Vegetarians have right to eat special.
Make Grove School more tofu- friendly.
Hello.
LlLLY:
Go sit by Jeremiah.
Be there in a minute.
She' s wearing that dorky hat again.
No.
Not right now.
What are you doing?
Writing a story?
Oh, well... my portfolio' s increased... by 30% since the last quarter.
Look what we have.
The perfect nerd couple.
Jeremiah and Mia.
Miah and Mia!
Listen, Jere.
The sweater you' re wearing -- was it designed for you... or did the knitting machine just blow up?
Sunglasses, girls.
It' s Jeremiah hair glare.
Is one of your magic tricks your hair?
- Hey, Lana?
- Huh?
That is such a cute cheerleading outfit.
It' s so clean- cut.
Of course it does!
Aah!
Mia, you' re such a freak!
Someday I might grow out of that... but you will never stop being a jerk.
Lana got coned!
- Mia!
- Toodles.
Mrs. Gupta, did you see what she did to me?
Oh, no, honey, I' m sorry.
I was in a very important meeting.
Send it out for dry cleaning.
It' s a present for your sixteenth birthday... from your father.
It was found among his possessions.
My birthday' s not for two weeks.
I know... but I wanted you to have it before we leave.
I return to Genovia the day after tomorrow.
Thank you.
If you open the locket I gave you... it becomes the key.
Thank you for bringing it down here.
I also came to apologize... for the way I spoke to you about the beach incident.
It was judge mental of me.
I didn' t pause to verify the facts.
That' s all right, Grandma.
I think you' d make a very fine princess.
You know, people think... princesses are supposed to wear tiaras... marry the prince, always look pretty... and live happily ever after... but it' s so much more than that.
It' s a real job.
You are an extraordinary person, Grandma... but I don' t think I' m meant to do this.
I would be so afraid... that I would disappoint the people of Genovia... and I couldn' t bear... to disappoint you again.
I have faith in you.
- I' m a writer.
- Ah!
I write soaps -- soap opera.
No, no.
It' s a big hit.
I wrote a character just like you once.
He was a spy.
I' m not a spy.
That' s what the character said.
I' il see you tonight, then.
I do have one favor to ask.
I need you to formally renounce your title... for the press at the ball, you know?
- Mm- hmm.
Do you think that maybe... considering my history with the press... it would be better if you did it?
Amelia, you wouldn' t stop driving your Mustang... just because a couple of insects hit the windshield?
Besides, look how far you' ve come... and I' il be right there with you.
I' il have Joseph pick you up at 7: 00.
Um...
I promised I' d let my mom drive me.
She wants to drive me to my first ball... or something.
All right.
I' il see you there, then.
Grandma?
I am sorry.
Oh, my dear.
You are first and foremost my granddaughter.
Please don' t be late.
Thank you, Dad, but I can' t be a princess.
I don' t make speeches... and I' m not Clarisse Renaldi and... and I just...
I can' t do it, OK?
I' m scared.
Joseph.
Charlotte, Miss Kawa.
Nice to meet you.
I have to get the band ready.
Of course.
Should you be going to get Princess Mia?
Mia told Clarisse her mother would be bringing her.
Helen just arrived and said Mia was waiting for you.
She' s going to run.
Come on, Fat Louie.
Time to pack.
Let' s get your things.
Louie, what have you got there?
Come on, Louie.
We' re going on a trip.
We' re going to Colorado... where we can climb some real rocks.
We are so out of here, Louie.
"today is your sixteenth birthday.
"Congratulations.
"special thoughts of your wonderful life."
"to pass on a piece of wisdom when one reaches this age.
"I pass it on to you as my father passed it on to me.
"Amelia, courage is not the absence of fear...
"that something else is more important than fear.
"but the cautious do not live at all.
"and who you can be.
"The key is to allow yourself to make the journey.
"and still think of her often.
"Happy birthday, my Mia.
"All my love, your father."
And there' s Countess Puck of Austria... as the glamorous continue to arrive... at the Genovian Independence Ball.
Despite the threat of rain... the big turnout includes the mayor of San Francisco... and a Genovian pear juggler.
The future of Genovia... is in the hands of young Mia Thermopolis.
Her decision tonight will affect the queen, the court... and all the people of this small but proud country.
Do you think it' s gonna rain on us?
It never comes down on Willie Brown.
Thank you.
Umbrellas up!
And that' s enough pear juggling.
The trip is off, Louie.
Perfect.
Come on, baby.
Genovians, you know... are famous for their impeccable taste in art.
Also for their cheese.
Maybe it' s string cheese.
Don' t do this, baby.
Gotcha!
Sorry, Mr. Robutusen!
Here you go.
It' s already paid for.
I didn' t order a pizza.
I' m sorry about that.
No, you must' ve.
Unless there' s another Michael Moscovitz living here.
We get a call, we deliver.
That' s our motto.
You don' t make the pizza?
I just deliver 'em.
Thank you.
Where are you from?
Oh, good, good.
The queen has entered.
Do we have any news on the Von Troken matter?
It' il be decided tonight, ma' am.
I' m afraid so.
Where is she?!
I know nothing!
Nothing?
Come here.
Oh, what?
Talk to me.
She went that way, then that way.
Two minutes ago.
Thank you very much.
Do we have any problems?
Everything' s perfect.
Perfect.
It' s wonderful.
You' re not very good at lying, Charlotte.
No, I' m not, Your Majesty.
But the garden looks beautiful.
Thank you.
Come on, baby.
You can make it.
Yes, come on!
Yes!
Baby, please, come on.
There' s no answer at Princess Mia' s house... and I couldn' t get Joseph on the cell phone.
There' s too much static from the storm.
The press is starting to complain... about making their deadlines.
If she' s not here in 10 minutes, I' il make the announcement.
Yes, ma' am.
It' s OK.
She' il be fine.
She' s gonna get here.
Is this punishment for driving without... a licensed driver in the front seat?!
I am invisible and I am wet.
No.
No interviews until later in the evening.
Yes, ma' am.
And we' re meeting Baroness and Baron Von Troken.
Is it true if the teenager refuses the princess- ship... your family will take over the country of Genovia?
Renaldi blood relative or we rule.
No, ma' am.
Then it' s time.
And put it in your pocket
Never let it fade away [Sobs]
You wouldn' t happen to be running away, would you?
What?
Dressed like this?
I' m going to a ball.
Good.
Get in.
Her Majesty, the Queen.
My fellow Genovians and honored guests... good evening.
I apologize for the delay and -- oh, hello --
And may I say... welcome to our grand Genovian Independence Day ball.
There' s no time to change.
You look fine.
Pretty and fine.
Just fine.
- No running.
- It' s nice.... a very special moment.
Thank you so much for your patience.
I have an announcement to make.
- My granddaughter -- - Ahem.
- She' s here!
- I see.
I would like to announce that my granddaughter has arrived.
With a fascinating explanation as to her wardrobe, I' m sure.
She' s styling a wet, sort of grunge- look hairdo... and is wearing a sweatshirt, jeans, and Docs.
Mia, would you care to say a few words?
Um, yes.
Why didn' t we dress like her?
We look like idiots.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Do you think they' re trying to save money on the gown?
Hi -- er, uh, hello.
Um...
It stopped raining.
[Chuckles]
I' m really no good at speech making.
Normally I get so nervous that I faint... or run away or sometimes I even get sick.
But you really didn' t need to know that.
But I' m not so afraid anymore.
My father helped me.
Earlier this evening, I had every intention... of giving up my claim to the throne... and my mother helped me by telling me that it was OK... and by supporting me like she has for my entire life.
But... then I wondered how I' d feel... after abdicating my role as Princess of Genovia.
Would I feel relieved or would I feel sad?
And then I realized... how many stupid times a day I use the word "l."
In fact, probably all I ever do... is think about myself.
And how lame is that... when there are 7 billion other people on the planet --
I' m going too fast.
But then I thought... if I cared about the other 7 billion out there... instead of just me... that' s probably a much better use of my time.
See, if I were Princess of Genovia... then my thoughts... and the thoughts of people smarter than me... would be much better heard and just maybe... those thoughts could be turned into actions.
So this morning when I woke up...
I choose to be forevermore...
Amelia Mignonette Thermopolis Renaldi...
Princess of Genovia.
I hope you didn' t order your stationery yet.
This was my very first tiara.
I was rather fond of it.
I' m hoping you will be, too.
Grandma, but you had it already.
How did you know I' d even be here?
Because I recognize the same spirit in you... as someone else I know.
Who?
Me.
Ah, you made it.
You bet your life, you big, tall string bean.
Here.
Paolo here to save the day.
The land I call my home
Forever will your banner wave
Her Majesty, Queen Clarisse... and Her Royal Highness, Amelia, Princess of Genovia.
I think perhaps we' d better get you dried off now.
Thank you.
No longer does Mia stand for "Missing In Action."
Genovia has a new princess.
They had the same idea I had... but now the garden is "occupado."
Why me?
Because you saw me when I was invisible.
And just because I' m royal... doesn' t mean I' m any different.
Come on, I' m really the same person.
Yes, I will have to live in Genovia... but I' il still go to school and...
MlA:
Dear diary... today is my first official day as Princess of Genovia.
We' il land in a few hours... and I' il meet the parliament and the people... before beginning my royal duties.
Mom is, of course, moving to Genovia with me... and will continue painting -- without the balloons.
Lilly and Michael are spending their summer vacation... at our -- can you believe it -- palace.
They' re even having my Mustang brought over... which I can legally drive in two weeks.
Grandma' s so glad to be going home.
And Joseph?
Well, he' s watching nearby as usual.
Everybody' s got pre- coronation jitters... including me.
Everybody, that is, except Fat Louie.
He' s totally adapted to being a royal.
I guess he was one all along.
JOSEPH:
Princess, look out the window... and welcome to Genovia.
You showed me dreams come to life
That taking a chance on us was right
25. 000
{y: i} That many worlds have been enslaved {y: i} by the Beast and his army, the Slayers.
{y: i} And this, too, was given me to know:
{y: i} That the Beast would come to our world, {y: i} the world of Krull... {y: i}... and his Black Fortress would be seen {y: i} in the land... {y: i}... that the smoke of burning villages {y: i} would darken the sky... {y: i}... and the cries of the dying echo {y: i} through deserted valleys.
{y: i} But one thing I cannot know:
{y: i} Whether the prophecy be true... {y: i}... that a girl of ancient name {y: i} shall become queen... {y: i}... that she shall choose a king, and that {y: i} together they shall rule our world... {y: i}... and that their son shall rule the galaxy.
Father!
Colwyn should have been here by now.
{y: i} He may be forced to travel {y: i} through the forests and the stone country.
{y: i} All the passes and the roads {y: i} are held by the Slayers.
{y: i} Colwyn may not get through.
{y: i} That would please you?
{y: i} I sent men to help.
{y: i} But I see no reason for an alliance {y: i} with our ancient enemies.
{y: i} Father, the invaders {y: i} are destroying our world.
{y: i} We must have the alliance.
{y: i} Only if we' re united, {y: i} do we stand a chance against them.
{y: i} Then, I' il make a treaty with King Turold.
{y: i} It' s not necessary for you to marry his son.
{y: i} It' s the only way to guarantee the alliance.
{y: i} The marriage is my choice.
If it were anyone but Turold' s son.
Colwyn is a great fighter.
Good fighters make bad husbands.
Perhaps.
Horsemen approaching!
Open the gate!
None came.
Twenty men were despatched to you.
We' ve lost 300 getting here.
I didn' t choose this marriage, Turold.
Nor did I, Eirig.
I chose it!
Your daughter chose it.
It' il be done.
And you' il lead this army with mine against the Slayers?
Whatever army I have, I' il lead against them...... until I' ve won or I' m dead.
I have chosen well.
So have I.
Your journey was hard?
But necessary.
- It may already be too late.
- It' s not too late.
Is this where the ceremony will be?
Tonight at moonrise.
My father says that good fighters make bad husbands.
- That depends.
- On what?
On whether you expect a husband to follow you around...... jump every time you clap your hands.
Wouldn' t you jump for me?
No, of course not.
You' re a warrior.
From this day, my kingdom is no more.
Nor mine.
A single kingdom under our children.
Agreed.
I give fire to water.
It will not return, except from the hand of the woman I choose as my wife.
I take fire from water.
I give it only to the man whom I choose as my husband.
Take the fire from my hand.
Call the roll, guards!
- Slayers!
- Arm yourselves!
- No.
Is there a safe way out?
- Come on!
My place is with you.
- Do you love me?
- Of course I love you.
Then go.
Colwyn, hurry back to me.
Everyone in the centre of the room, get back!
Take it!
Here!
Colwyn!
Lyssa!
Father!
She' s alive.
Where?
Stay still!
Where?
For now, beyond your reach.
Who are you?
I am Ynyr.
The old one.
Well, not as old as all that.
You' ve come down from the Granite Mountains.
Yes.
I am needed now.
Father!
There' s no time now for grief.
You haven' t lost a father and a bride on the same day.
Nor have I become king on that day.
I have no kingdom.
Your kingdom may be greater than you know.
I give it to you, old man, and welcome to it.
I came to find a king...... and I find a boy instead.
Lyssa?
They will hold her in the Black Fortress.
Can you lead me to it?
You must have help.
I' il find men on the way.
In the Fortress, you will face more than the Slayers.
You will face the Beast, who is their leader.
He can be killed.
Perhaps.
But no man has ever seen him and lived.
You will need more than men and swords.
You will need the power of the Glaive.
The Glaive is nothing but an ancient symbol.
It doesn' t really exist.
It exists, up there.
In a cave on the highest peak.
Without the Glaive, you will never be able to reach Lyssa.
I need weapons, not symbols.
Once, the Glaive was a very powerful weapon.
It can be so again.
But only in the hands of the right man.
For only the right man can retrieve the Glaive.
Am I that man?
I wish I knew.
I cannot go with you.
If it' s there, I' il come back with it.
If you do not come back with it...... you' il not come back at all.
{y: i} You have been brought here for a marriage.
{y: i} I am the king you will choose.
Do not use it until you need it.
- How will I know when?
- You' il know.
If you lead me to the Black Fortress, I' il use it soon enough.
That will not be so easy.
At each sunrise, the Black Fortress moves.
Sometimes it is in the mountains, sometimes in the desert...... sometimes in the sea.
Never the same place twice.
But you told me you knew where to find it!
There are kingly virtues other than bravery.
Courtesy is one of them.
I' m sorry.
It' s the thought of Lyssa there.
I, too, was young...... once.
I, too, loved as you do.
But your love will be...... luckier than mine.
What I told you is that I knew how to find the Fortress...... and that is by seeking the vision of the blind Emerald Seer.
But his place isn' t known either.
It is known to me.
Come.
Help!
Help!
I' m drowning!
This might have been quicksand!
I might have been sucked to my death while you stood there gawking!
Where is this place?
The forest near the Granite Mountains.
Blast!
1, 000 miles off course.
I was rushed.
There was a difference of opinion concerning a gooseberry pie.
The man left it sitting on his windowsill.
- What did he expect?
- Perhaps he expected to eat it.
For that rudeness, lout, I think I' il turn you into a bat.
Might teach you some manners to hang upside down for an hour or two.
The Hill People lack the power to do harm.
We' il see about that!
No, that' s a recipe for hot fudge sauce.
It' il have to be a goose.
Fat and ugly.
Very ugly.
From that, you see what I could' ve done to you if I were a vengeful man.
You may leave me now.
Dear, dear.
Let me see now "..."
The forest is not safe.
You' d best travel with us!
Me, travel with you?
Do you know who I am?
No.
I am Ergo the Magnificent.
Short in stature, tall in power...... narrow of purpose and wide of vision.
And I do not travel with peasants and beggars.
Goodbye.
Wait for me!
I' ve just remembered I have urgent business in this direction.
What business?
Staying alive.
{y: i} I will allow you to go {y: i} wherever you please within these walls.
{y: i} For this is the palace from which you {y: i} will rule this world and countless others.
{y: i} You cannot escape me.
{y: i} You will be my queen.
You' re no great chooser of roads, old man.
This way will save us half a day' s travel.
Robbers.
They' re men, we don' t know yet whether they' re robbers.
Faces that ugly could only belong to robbers.
I' il turn them all into pigs.
You' re surrounded by 100 men!
100 is not enough!
What have we here?
A fighter!
Besides, you' re short about 90 men.
Let' s just kill them and be done with it.
Soft, Rhun!
I don' t kill men without good reason.
Nor do I. And be thankful for it.
You' re escaped prisoners.
Every one.
Slaves, bandits, fighters and brawlers.
Desperate men.
- As desperate as you' il ever see.
- Good.
Those are the kind of men I need.
You need?
Well, see, these men follow no man but me...... and I follow no man at all.
- A king?
There are many lunatics wandering through the country claiming to be kings.
Would you follow a king to the Black Fortress?
Now I know you' re a lunatic.
I wouldn' t follow my own father to the Black Fortress.
- Lf he could find it!
- He wouldn' t be so foolish.
Is it foolish to defend your world?
To fight for your homes and families?
If the invaders conquer, you' il be slaves with the rest of us.
Noble sentiments, but we fight for profit.
- You know what I mean?
And fame.
Freedom?
But we have it.
And fame, it' s an empty purse.
Count it, go broke...... eat it, go hungry...... seek it and go mad.
That is true.
But this fame and this freedom you could leave to your sons.
How did you know I had sons?
If the Slayers conquer Krull, your sons will be enslaved forever.
I have no sons, but I will go with you.
The boy shames you all.
Only the king and the lord marshal have the keys to these manacles.
- You don' t look like a lord marshal.
- No.
You look about the right age to be Turold' s son.
The exact age.
Torquil, you' re growing old.
Your brain' s softening.
Nine men like you are worth an army.
If we succeed, unlock them.
Otherwise, I' il die with them.
Well, you heard him!
We' re now an army!
An unpaid army.
You got a problem, Rhun?
Can' t a man even talk to himself without being interrupted?
Let' s go!
- Come along!
- Nennog!
Move!
Gooseberries!
Ergo!
Ynyr, help!
Horrible!
There was a terrible creature over there.
And over there, a creature with only one eye.
- One eye?
- A Cyclops.
He was aiming a spear straight at me.
Had it been so, you would now be dead.
He was aiming at a Slayer...... for they have ancient hatred between them.
Long ago, his ancestors lived in a world far from Krull.
And had...... two eyes like other men.
Then they made a bargain with the Beast who is the leader of the Slayers.
They gave up one of their eyes in exchange for the power...... to see into the future.
But they were cheated.
For the only future they are permitted to see...... is the time of their own death.
They' re sad, solitary creatures, born to know...... the day they will die.
Today would have been my day, if it hadn' t been for him.
The rest will remain here.
We four will go on.
I' m not staying behind with these criminals!
We four will go.
He marches us towards a solid face of rock.
The man has raisins in his braincase.
I recognise an old friend.
They' re all mad!
We seek the Black Fortress.
Such a vision will be opposed.
Who seeks it?
The new king.
With an old voice?
You know the voice?
Yes, my friend.
We' re trying to find the...
I will seek the Fortress for you.
- Got any sugarballs?
- No.
- Gumdrops?
- No.
What kind of boy are you?
Boys always have candy.
I have a cinnamon bar.
Share and share alike.
I am Ergo the Magnificent.
Short in stature, tall in power, narrow of purpose and wide of vision.
That is very impressive.
I should hope so.
I' m Titch.
That' s not impressive, but adequate.
The Black Fortress.
Where is it?
Are you all right?
Yes.
The Beast does not like curious Seers poking into his affairs.
His power is too great for you to overcome?
Here.
But there is one place where his power cannot reach.
The Emerald Temple.
In that place, he cannot oppose my vision.
Will you travel there with us?
It is in the Great Swamp:
A treacherous place.
Our need is great.
The Temple is at the centre of the Swamp, where three trees grow as one.
It smells of death.
Death and power are close cousins.
Don' t think I like your relatives, old man.
Have a look.
The profit of this journey.
They' re worth a fortune.
To someone who' s very nearsighted.
What?
But they were emeralds.
Hey, Rhun, emeralds.
They were emeralds!
Rocks in our pockets and gravestones above our heads is all we' il get from this.
Slayers!
- From the lake!
- Take cover!
Quick, over there!
Colwyn!
That' s the second time you' ve saved my life.
- I am Ergo.
- The Magnificent.
Hasn' t he got a name?
His name is Rell.
He visits the Seer sometimes.
He doesn' t speak much.
Except to be sarcastic to people who wish to be friends.
Or jest with those who already are his friends.
My name is no jest, beanpole.
It' s nice to have a short name if you' re 20 feet tall...... but small people need large names to give them weight.
Your actions give you weight, my friend.
I saw you save the boy from a spear.
That' s what friends are supposed to do for each other.
Quite so.
You' ve been with us for a long way now.
Since the beginning.
When I learned that the Old One had come down...... I knew that the time had come.
Join us, then.
All men need company.
Yes.
All men.
That way.
If I had my wish, I' d be out of this gloomy place right away.
If I really had my wish, I' d be sitting on top of a gooseberry pie...... as big as a mountain.
No, that' s a bit greedy.
I' il settle for one as big as a house.
I' d wish for a puppy.
Only one puppy?
If you' re wishing, why not wish for 100?
I only want one.
That' s a foolish wish.
And you, Rell, what would you wish for?
Ignorance.
No!
- Nennog!
- Help!
Help him!
It' s sinking!
It is the power of the Beast.
Make a chain!
Get me out!
Rhun, get hold of him!
- Pull!
Give me the axe!
Pull!
Pull!
I' m slipping!
Menno!
Help me!
Help me!
Keep still!
Don' t struggle!
Reach!
Keep still, Menno!
Pull!
Menno!
Is that you, Titch?
- Not far now.
Stay here, make sure we' re not being followed.
- I will stay.
- Be careful.
Thank you.
Titch, you go ahead.
Thank you, brother.
I' il lead the Seer.
You go ahead with Titch.
- This way?
- No.
You sure?
I recognise this tree.
I recognise the place now.
We' re in sight of the trees, brother.
He who seeks the knowledge must lead me.
No one else may approach.
Here is the knowledge you seek.
The Beast has many weapons.
This was one of them.
The Changeling.
How did you know?
I found the Seer' s body in the quicksand.
He gave his life for us.
He was my only family.
We' re your family now.
MORTAL KOMBAT
Your brother' s soul is mine.
Liu!
You will be next.
Chan.
"Liu Kang - Brother Dead.
Grandfather "
Let' s go.
ls the perimeter secured?
- Better be, I want Kano.
- Trust me.
- I trust 1 person.
You talk to her.
Good boy.
She' s here.
Right on time.
I love punctuality in a woman... don' t you...
Now, you' re sure she' il follow me?
You killed her partner, didn' t you?
She' il follow you into hell.
Just make sure she' s on that boat.
Sonya Blade must be at the tournament.
Have our own little honeymoon cruise.
lf you so much as touch her, Kano... you' il need a seeing eye dog.
Where' s Kano?
Where is he?
Let' s dance.
This is where you fall down.
Where do you get these guys?
The press says I don' t know how to do this stuff?
- Cut.
- I won' t do it again.
- What do you mean?
- It' s the last shot!
Then I' il shoot myself for being in your movie.
I' il be back directing traffic.
Don' t leave me hanging up here.
Excuse me, there' s someone who wants to speak to you.
- Who is it?
- I don' t really know.
- No, of course not.
- Oh God, no.
You want me to find out?
Mister, you' re in my chair.
"Johnny Cage A Fake!"
Hi, Johnny.
Master Boyd.
The press is still giving you a hard time.
Yeah, they think I' m a fake.
Prove it?
How?
The tournament.
It' s held once a generation.
The world' s best fighters are invited.
You win the tournament, you win their respect.
They' il tell the entire world you' re the real goods.
- So how do I...?
- There' s a boat.
Hong Kong, tomorrow.
Be on it.
"The Temple of Light, China"
Liu.
ls this the place?
This is where we found his body.
What happened?
After you left for America... he followed in your footsteps.
Grandfather... it wasn' t enough to fill my head with that nonsense?
To save the world is not nonsense.
Men fighting in a simple contest don' t decide these things.
How can a wise man believe this?
We all believe in it... including your brother.
Liu Kang has been given the dream.
He is the Chosen One.
He left our temple.
Turned his back on us.
Why have you come back?
I want to represent the Order of Light at the Tournament.
My brother' s killer will be there.
That cannot be your only reason for going... or you will fail.
Oh yes, I forgot.
That' s why you left the temple... and ran away, isn' t it?
The Great Tournament was too much responsibility.
But vengeance... that' s so much simpler.
Lord Rayden.
You' re still running away from your destiny.
Rayden?
This isn' t your God of Thunder.
- He' s a beggar.
American life has enfeebled his mind.
Too much television.
So, you' re going to win the tournament?
- Yes, I am.
- Show me how.
Oh, don' t tell me you' re afraid... of a simple beggar?
lf you are Rayden... why did you let Chan die?
- Why didn' t you?
I' ve had enough of this.
I' il find my brother' s killer at the tournament.
With or without your consent.
He isn' t ready, my Lord... and we lost so much time.
I know.
"Chai Wan Bay, Hong Kong"
Ah, give me a break.
"Johnny Cage Fake!"
- Sure.
Aren' t you Art Lean?
I saw you fight in London, you' re great.
Thanks.
I saw some of your films.
You can' t fake those moves.
Yeah, well, tell that to the press.
Pal, when the ship comes in... could you put these on board?
I pay money.
You carry bags.
- Or is that too complicated?
- No.
Good.
Thank God I didn' t ask him to park the car.
Nothing says that creep at the club wasn' t lying.
Kano could be 1000 miles from here by now.
What is that?
You must be kidding me.
Wait.
That' s it, Blade... come to Papa.
Sonya, don' t get on that thing.
Hey, you.
Alright, tough guy, you want to get... tough?
Do you?
I' m Johnny Cage.
And you are?
Where' s Kano?
But I can help you find him.
Out of my way.
Just another starstruck fan, huh?
I' m honored to finally meet you.
Shang Tsung at your service.
I' m looking for a murderer.
He boarded this ship.
I' m impressed.
I' d love to give it to you myself.
Be nice to the lady.
She' s doing her job.
When I want back- up I' il radio for it.
Got that radio handy?
Scorpion and Sub- Zero.
The deadliest of enemies... but slaves under my power.
Move aside.
- Enough.
- Lord Rayden.
How good of you to grace us with your... presence.
Your sideshow freaks attacked my fighters.
That is expressly forbidden before the tournament... as your emperor well knows.
My sincere apologies.
It won' t happen again, I promise you.
- I shall see to that.
Until we reach the island... where you have no dominion.
My dominions are well known to me, sorcerer.
- Thank you.
- What tournament?
You' ve been chosen, Sonya.
Much to my delight.
You really are Rayden.
Come with me.
1 guy with things coming out of his hand, 1 who freezes stuff... and 1 man who seems to be made out of electricity.
What' s going on?
There is a rational explanation.
He' s Rayden, God of Lightening and Protector of the Realm of Earth.
Listen.
What you' re about to face is... vastly more important than... your ego... your enemy... or your quest for revenge.
You have embarked... on a sacred mission.
You have been chosen to defend the Realm of Earth... in a tournament called Mortal Kombat.
Defend it from who?
Your world is but one of many realms.
One of them is a forsaken land called Outworld... ruled by an immortal who has crowned himself emperor.
Now, wait a second.
lf this guy is so powerful... why doesn' t he invade us?
To enter the Realm of Earth the Emperor' s demon sorcerer, Shang Tsung... and his warriors must win 10 straight victories in Mortal Kombat.
They have won nine.
This will be the tenth.
A handful of people on a leaky boat are going to save the world?
Exactly.
The essence of Mortal Kombat... is not about death... but life.
Mortal men and women... defending your own world.
Why are you telling me this?
What about the others?
One of you will decide the outcome of the tournament.
The fate... of billions will depend upon you.
What about Shang Tsung?
Oh, still concerned only with vengeance?
lf you challenge Shang Tsung now... you' il lose your life and your soul.
He' il pay for my brother' s death.
You' re not ready.
Look.
It has begun.
It has begun.
Black Hawk calling Cardinal.
ls anybody monitoring?
Jaxx, this is Sonya.
While you' re at it, call my agent.
Do I look like your secretary?
What are you doing?
The electrical disturbance blew out the transistors.
Your radio equipment' s fine.
Look at your compass.
Where the hell are we?
- Do I look like your travel agent?
Okay...
What' s going on?
I don' t know.
But what if all the legends were true?
What legends?
Do you need help with those?
Ah, no more steps.
Great!
Can' t wait to see the bathrooms.
When a woman looks at you like that... it usually means something.
Princess Kitana.
She' s our most dangerous adversary.
Watch her carefully, Reptile.
Keep her away from these humans.
Welcome.
Mortal Kombat.
Tomorrow morning the great combat begins.
Some will have the distinct honor... and pleasure... to face Prince Goro... our reigning champion.
You are witnesses to a great turning point in the history... of your planet.
Treasure these moments... as if they were your last.
Now, for a taste of things to come...
Flawless victory.
"Come to a little tournament," he said.
"Be good for the career," he said.
Liu.
- Where are you going?
- After Shang Tsung.
You can' t go after him.
Remember what Rayden said?
He didn' t say anything to me.
He knows where Kano' s hiding.
You know, you' ve got to admire her.
When she sets her mind on something...
It' s not her mind you' re admiring.
True.
How many times must I tell you?
I can take care of myself.
It' s a guy thing.
- Where are you going?
- I' m following him.
- I work alone.
- No, Shang Tsung is mine.
Let' s forget about Shang.
Forget about him?
I want to get to the bottom of this.
Are you out of your mind?
You go ahead.
Find out what that was.
I believe in a fair fight.
You know, one- on- one, man- to- man... hand to hand.
Like my daddy taught me.
But what I just saw wasn' t very fair.
That' s Kano.
Forget about Kano.
And then he explodes.
Almost lost my lunch.
Disgusting.
What I want to know... if this Shang Tsung guy' s so great... how come he' s got such a crummy looking boat?
Well, anyway, guy gives me the creeps.
"Treasure these moments".
That was his intention.
Shang Tsung is a great sorcerer.
The wise cultivate his favor.
Those who challenge his power... become his slaves.
I haven' t seen any of them around.
You fool!
You know nothing.
He enslaves souls.
He learned the black arts from the Emperor himself.
- right?
- I am Goro! general of the armies of Outworld and prince... of the subterranean realm of Shokan.
Subterranean?
What' s that, something like underground?
Yes, something like... that.
Well...
I mean, back home.
How lucky for them...
Prince Goro.
Why else would I have chosen such a disreputable looking cretin?
Look at him.
No dignity... no manners.
Yet in the realm of Earth... such men can amass great wealth... and almost godlike power.
I' d get back to my amassing as soon as possible, if you don' t mind.
Now, when do I get paid?
After you' ve fought the girl.
But remember... she' s not to be harmed, only humiliated.
I have plans for my beautiful Sonya.
To what do we owe the honor of your visit, Shang Tsung?
To warn you Kung Lao' s descendant is competing in the tournament.
- Handle him carefully.
He' il pose no problem.
This is no time for foolish pride.
Which is why I' ve come to warn you of another danger.
The Emperor' s adopted daughter?
Why should I worry about her?
Princess Kitana is 10, 000 years old... and the rightful heir to the throne of Outworld.
She must not join the forces from the Realm of Earth... especially Liu Kang.
What' s so special about you?
I don' t know.
The Emperor will not tolerate failure... and neither will l.
I do not fail.
Let' s get out of here.
What is it?
We are not alone.
Wait a second, I don' t remember this.
Look!
That has to be Princess Kitana.
She' s trying to help us.
- You' re hard up for a date.
Forget her.
- So what?
- Liu?
- What happened?
- There' s something here.
It' s following Princess Kitana.
Where is she?
I don' t know.
- Where are we going?
Kitana went this way.
I can smell her perfume.
I don' t smell anything.
I smell something.
Bullshit.
We got company.
Just the way I like them.
Dumb and ugly.
- Piece of cake, huh?
- Well, it was easy for me.
- Get over yourself.
What is it with you guys?
We' re standing... they' re not.
What more do you want?
Absolutely brilliant.
So, why don' t you show me what you plan to do about... them?
I don' t think so.
You' il find that this is the way out.
You guys are lucky he stopped us.
- So, you' ve seen what you' il face?
- You mean Goro?
- And Shang Tsung.
- Will he fight in the tournament?
lf he chooses to.
As a former champion he has the right to do so.
And he' s far more dangerous than Goro.
His power comes from the souls of vanquished warriors.
To fight Shang Tsung... is to face not one... but a legion of adversaries.
Remember that.
Tomorrow the tournament begins.
Be prepared.
From this moment on... my island will be your battleground.
You will be first.
Let Mortal Kombat begin.
Your soul is mine.
Fatality.
Sonya Blade!
I have something for you, my dear.
I don' t want anything from you.
I have something you want very much.
You can thank me later.
Hello, baby.
Did you miss me?
Now look at this.
This little baby brings back memories, doesn' t it?
You used it to knife your mother in the back?
It put a big smile on your partner, though.
Ear... to ear...
Give it up.
Study this.
Does it hurt, baby?
Finish him.
No, Sonya.
- Give me a break!
Get over here!
Come here!
Welcome!
Get down here!
"To my Greatest Fan Johnny Cage"
Begin!
Fight with all of your heart or there is no hope.
Why do you care if I win?
To win your next match, use the element which brings life.
Kitana!
Remember my words.
That' s enough!
You disappoint me.
Not very wise.
Use the element which brings life.
Water.
ls it time?
Yes.
We' ve let these humans win enough.
At last.
What the...?
Yeah, that' s it! ln and out!
Come on.
You can do it!
Use your feet.
Kick him!
Get up!
Get out!
Finish him!
Time to die.
Finish him.
Flawless victory.
Your soul is mine!
We can' t win!
How can we possibly beat something like that?
Good question.
Shang Tsung' s power can be destroyed by mortal men and women.
You can overcome any adversary... no matter how bizarre their powers may seem.
There is always a way.
Your own fear.
So, who says we' re afraid?
You must first face your fears... if you are to conquer them.
You, Johnny, are afraid you' re a fake... so you' il rush into any fight just to prove you' re not.
You' il fight... bravely enough... but foolishly... carelessly... and you' il be beaten.
You, Sonya... are afraid to admit even you sometimes need help.
lf you are afraid to trust... you will lose.
Wait.
What about me?
Oh, you.
You fear your own destiny.
You already fled once when you went to America, so... you' re guilty about Chan' s death.
I am responsible for Chan' s death.
Every mortal is responsible for his own destiny.
Why can' t you?
I tried.
Despair is the most dangerous fear.
I know this... and so does Shang Tsung.
He can peer into your soul... and use the fear he sees against you.
You must be prepared.
Liu!
You will be next.
Goro' s never been beaten.
You go up against him, he' il kill you.
lf I don' t... then he' il finish us off one at a time.
I can finish this.
You' re making this sound simple and it isn' t.
Yeah, it is.
'Cause I can' t let what happened to Art happen to you.
Not to you.
Oh, don' t you dare do this to protect me, Johnny Cage.
Trust me.
I don' t believe this!
You are the most egotistical... self- deluded person I have ever met.
You forgot "good looking."
Challenging Goro, eh?
You weren' t supposed to fight him now.
Are you that eager to die?
I' m not the one who' il die.
I see.
The true sign of a hero.
But make no mistake.
They too will die... after Goro destroys you.
So what' s the problem?
As you wish.
As absurd as your request is, I shall grant it.
ln a place designated by me for the final battle... of the tournament.
- You got it, pal.
- I don' t think so.
Too late, Lord Rayden.
The rules are quite clear.
"A deal' s a deal."
What have you done?
I made a choice.
Mortal Kombat.
We fight it.
Good.
At last one of them has understood.
Finish him quickly.
Pay me my tribute.
This puny mortal will be no problem.
I' il crush him in one blow.
Let' s dance.
Sorry.
You imbecile.
Damn, that hurt.
Finish him.
Those were $500 sunglasses, asshole.
This is where you fall down.
Let me go!
Stop!
I hereby exercise my right to challenge.
I challenge her.
You' re a coward, sorcerer.
Stand and fight.
We had a deal, remember?
Mortal Kombat continues.
I' m simply... changing the place... as we agreed.
- Sonya!
- Wait!
- Where' s he taken her?
- To the Emperor' s castle... in the wastelands of Outworld, where I cannot follow.
We can.
Rayden... Can Sonya beat Shang Tsung?
I' m sorry.
Neglected to mention it.
She must accept the challenge or there' il be no final combat.
I have nothing further to teach you, Liu Kang.
You possess the knowledge.
All that is lacking now is the will.
You sure you don' t want to go?
ln Outworld, if you look hard enough... you will find another guide.
Good luck.
They' il need it.
This is not good.
But I' m fine.
I can deal with this.
So... this is Outworld.
I can see why they want a change of scenery.
We should head for that tower.
He' d have taken Sonya there.
I hate this place.
I do.
It' s like being back in high school!
What' s that?
Wait.
What?
There' s something else.
Oh, great.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Reptile.
Oh no, you don' t.
Well done.
You' re finally learning, Liu Kang.
Kitana.
Come with me.
What happened here?
The same thing that will happen to your world... unless you prevent it.
My father was the rightful ruler of Outworld
Then his best warriors lost ten Mortal Kombats... and the Emperor entered the Realm... killed my parents and adopted me... to lay claim to the throne.
but it was beautiful once... before Shang Tsung engineered its destruction.
How can I stop this from happening in my world?
I would not have helped you.
You must face yourself.
I will not fight you, Shang Tsung.
I am not playing your game.
My sweet Sonya.
There' s no one else.
lf you don' t fight... the Realm of Earth will forfeit the Tournament... and its portals will open... to our great Emperor.
You' re lying.
My friends will come for me.
Such an endearing human trait.
One last chance, Sonya.
Fight me in Mortal Kombat.
Go to hell.
Take her away.
The Emperor will be overjoyed.
My friends will come.
They' re already here.
- Seize them.
- Stay where you are.
Will you dare interfere with the tournament... and betray our Emperor?
ln his great wisdom, he knows that Mortal Kombat... cannot be won by treachery.
How dare you speak to me of treachery?
Your ignorance will lose forever... the keys to the Realm of Earth.
Very well.
I challenge you.
You' il fight me.
I am Liu Kang... descendant of Kung Lao.
I challenge you to Mortal Kombat.
Do you accept or yield?
I accept.
Leave us.
I will take care.. of this impudent mortal myself.
Nice dress.
You fool.
What' s that noise?
The source of all Shang Tsung' s power.
The souls of 1000 dead warriors.
Face your enemy.
ls that all you' ve got, sorcerer?
Liu Kang!
I can see into your soul.
You will die.
Face yourself.
You can look into my soul... but you don' t own it.
Face your worst fear.
I' m not afraid of my destiny.
Face me.
Liu.
Chan?
It can' t be you.
To help you.
You' re not really Chan.
You promised you' d always take care of me?
I remember.
It' s my turn to take care of you.
Come with me.
I forgive you for letting me die.
It wasn' t my fault.
- No.
Chan chose his own path.
Every man is responsible for his own destiny.
Shang Tsung killed my brother.
You' re mine.
The Chosen One.
I am The Chosen One.
You hear your slaves, sorcerer?
You have lost your power over them.
They have risen up against you.
Free them.
They are mine forever.
All those souls, and you don' t have your own.
I pity you, sorcerer.
Save your pity for the weak.
Surrender!
Never!
Flawless victory.
I knew you' d come.
Chan.
One day... we will be reunited... but until then my spirit will always be with you.
Go in peace, my brother.
Let' s go home..
I' ve been waiting for you.
What took you so long?
I guess you knew it would end this way.
Didn' t have a clue.
You humans are so unpredictable.
I must tell you something... you guys did great.
- What is it?
The Emperor.
You weak, pathetic fools.
I' ve come for your souls.
I don' t think so.
My name is Jack Torrance.
His office is the first door on the Ieft.
Thank you.
Mr. UIlman?
I' m Jack Torrance.
Come on in, Jack.
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
This is my secretary, Susie.
- Susie, how do you do?
No problem at aIl.
I made the trip in 3 1 / 2 hours.
Sit down a minute, Jack.
Like some coffee?
- Susie.
Yes, I wiIl.
Yeah?
Do you reaIly want to go and Iive in that hoteI for the winter?
Sure I do.
Yeah.
I guess so.
I know.
It always takes a Iittle time to make new friends.
Yeah, I guess so.
He' s Iooking forward to the hotel, I bet.
No, I ain 't, Mrs. Torrance.
Don' t be siIly.
I don 't want to go there.
How come you don' t want to go?
I just don 't.
Did they give you any idea in Denver...... about what the job entails?
Only in a very generaI way.
The winters can be fantasticaIly cruel.
The basic idea is to cope with the very costly damage...... and depreciation which can occur.
This consists mainly of running the boiler...... heating different parts of the hoteI on a daily rotating basis...... repairing damage as it occurs...... and doing repairs so the elements can' t get a foothold.
That sounds fine to me.
PhysicaIly, it' s not a very demanding job.
The only thing that can get a bit trying here during the winter...... is a tremendous sense of isolation.
That just happens to be exactly what I' m Iooking for.
I' m outlining a new writing project.
Five months of peace is just what I want.
Because, for some people...... solitude...... and isolation...... can, of itself, become a problem.
Not for me.
Do you think they' II take to it?
Great.
Before I turn you over to BiIl...... there' s one other thing I think we should talk about.
Not to sound melodramatic...... but it' s been known to give a few people...... second thoughts about the job.
I' m intrigued.
I don' t suppose they said anything in Denver...... about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970.
I don' t believe they did.
My predecessor in this job...... hired a man named Charles Grady as the winter caretaker.
He came up with his wife and 2 Iittle girls of about 8 and 10.
He had a good employment record, good references.
And from what I' ve been told, he seemed...... Iike a completely normaI individual.
But at some point during the winter...... he must have suffered some kind of a complete mentaI breakdown.
He ran amuck...
... and kiIled his family with an ax.
Stacked them neatly in a room in the west wing, and then...... he put both barrels of his shotgun in his mouth.
The police thought...... that it was what the old- timers used to caII cabin fever.
A kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur...... when people are shut in together over Iong periods of time.
That is...... quite a story.
Yeah, it is.
It' s stiII hard for me to believe it actuaIly happened here.
But it did.
I think you can appreciate why I wanted to teII you about it.
I also understand why your people in Denver...... Ieft it for you to teII me.
Obviously, some people can be put off...... from staying in a place where something Iike that happened.
You can rest assured that' s not going to happen with me.
And as far as my wife is concerned...... I' m sure she' II be absolutely fascinated when I teII her.
She' s a confirmed ghost story...... and horror film addict.
Tony, do you think Dad' II get the job?
He already did.
He' s going to phone Wendy up in a few minutes to tell her.
- Hi, hon.
How' s it going?
Great.
I' m at the hoteI and I stiII have a Iot to do.
I don' t think I can get home before 9 or 10.
Sounds Iike you got the job.
It' s a beautifuI place.
You and Danny are going to love it.
I don 't know.
You do too know.
Now come on, teII me.
I don 't want to.
Please.
No.
Now, Tony, teII me.
We must reaIly be high up.
The air feels so different.
Dad?
I' m hungry.
You should' ve eaten your breakfast.
We' II get you something as soon as we get to the hotel.
Wasn' t it around here that the Donner party got snowbound?
I think that was farther west, in the Sierras.
What was the Donner party?
They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.
They had to resort to cannibalism in order to stay alive.
You mean they ate each other up?
Jack.
Don' t worry, Mom.
I know aII about cannibalism.
I saw it on TV.
See, it' s okay.
He saw it on the television.
- 8: 30.
That gives us plenty of time to go over everything.
- Bye.
I hope you haven' t been waiting too Iong.
Good.
Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen.
Is your family having a Iook around?
No, my son' s discovered the games room.
- Has your Iuggage been brought in?
- Right there.
In view of aII we have to cover today...... I suggest we have a quick Iook at your apartment and get started.
Have the Torrances' things brought to their apartment.
I' d better coIlect my family first.
This is our Colorado Lounge.
My God!
This place is fantastic, isn' t it, hon?
It sure is.
This is the staff wing of the hotel.
None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.
- Goodbye, Mr. UIlman.
- Goodbye, girls.
And here are your quarters.
And a smaII bedroom for your son.
Perfect for a child.
When was the Overlook built?
Construction started in 1907.
It was finished in 1909.
The site' s supposedly on an Indian buriaI ground.
They had to repeI a few Indian attacks as they were building it.
That' s our Snowcat.
Can you both drive a car?
That' s fine.
BasicaIly the Snowcat operates very much Iike a car.
It won' t take you Iong to get the hang of it.
This is the kitchen, huh?
This is it.
Is it big enough for you?
It' s the biggest place I ever seen.
This whole place is such an enormous maze.
I' II have to Ieave a traiI of breadcrumbs every time I come in.
Don' t Iet it get you down.
It' s big, but it ain' t nothing but a kitchen.
A Iot of this stuff you' II never have to touch.
I wouldn' t know what to do with it if I did.
One thing for sure, you don' t have to worry about food.
You could eat here for a year and never have the same menu twice.
Right here is our walk- in freezer.
This is where we keep aII of our meat.
You got 15 rib roasts...... 30 ten- pound bags of hamburger.
You Iike Iamb, Doc?
What' s your favorite food?
French fries and ketchup.
Come along.
Watch your step.
How' d you know we caII him Doc?
- Beg your pardon?
- You caIled Danny "Doc" twice.
I did?
We caII him Doc sometimes, Iike in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.
But how did you know?
I guess I heard you caII him that.
But I don' t remember...... caIling him that since we' ve been with you.
Anyway, he Iooks Iike a Doc, doesn' t he?
Now, this is the storeroom.
In here is where we keep aII the dried goods and the canned goods.
We got canned fruits and vegetables...... canned fish and meats, hot and cold cereals.
Post Toasties, Corn Flakes, Sugar Puffs...... Rice Krispies, oatmeal, Wheatena and Cream of Wheat.
You got a dozen jugs of black molasses.
We got 60 boxes of dried milk...
How' d you like some ice cream, Doc?
We' ve got dried peaches, dried apricots...... dried raisins and dried prunes.
You know, you got to keep regular if you want to be happy.
- How' re you getting on?
- Fine.
We' re on our way to the basement.
No problem.
I was just getting to the ice cream.
I thought so.
You mind if I give Danny some ice cream?
- Not at aIl.
- Good.
- Sound good to you, Doc?
Okay, you behave yourself.
What kind of ice cream do you Iike?
Chocolate.
Come on, son.
It' s amazing, aII this activity today.
The guests and some staff Ieft yesterday, but the...... Iast day' s always hectic.
Everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible.
By 5: 00 tonight, you' II never know anybody was ever here.
Just Iike a ghost ship, huh?
Do you know how I knew your name was Doc?
You know what I' m talking about, don' t you?
I can remember when I was a Iittle boy...... my grandmother and I could hold conversations...... entirely without ever opening our mouths.
She caIled it "shining."
And for a Iong time I thought it was just the two of us...... that had "the shine" to us.
Like you probably thought you was the only one.
But there are other folks...... though mostly they don' t know it, or don' t believe it.
How Iong have you been able to do it?
Why don' t you want to talk about it?
I' m not supposed to.
Who says you ain' t supposed to?
Tony.
Who' s Tony?
Tony' s the Iittle boy that Iives in my mouth.
Is Tony the one that teIls you things?
How does he teII you things?
It' s Iike I go to sleep and he shows me things.
But when I wake up, I can' t remember everything.
Does your mom and dad know about Tony?
Do they know he teIls you things?
Tony told me never to teII them.
Has Tony ever told you anything about this place?
About the Overlook Hotel?
I don' t know.
Think.
Is there something bad here?
You know, Doc, when something happens...... it can Ieave a trace of itself behind.
Say, Iike...... if someone burns toast.
Maybe things that happen Ieave other kind of traces behind.
Not things that anyone can notice.
But things that people who shine can see.
Just Iike they can see things that haven' t happened yet...
... sometimes they can see things that happened a Iong time ago.
I think a Iot of things happened right here...... in this particular hoteI over the years.
And not aII of them was good.
What about Room 237?
Room 237?
You' re scared of Room 237, ain' t you?
No, I ain' t.
Mr. HaIlorann, what is in Room 237?
Nothing.
There ain' t nothing in Room 237.
But you ain' t got no business going in there anyway.
So stay out.
You understand?
Stay out!
Good morning, hon.
Your breakfast is ready.
What time is it?
It' s about 11: 30.
Jesus!
I guess we' ve been staying up too Iate.
I know it.
I made them just the way you Iike them, sunny- side up.
Nice.
It' s reaIly pretty outside.
How about taking me for a walk after you finish your breakfast?
I suppose I ought to try to do some writing first.
Any ideas yet?
No good ones.
It' s just a matter of settling into the habit of writing every day.
That' s aII it is.
- And you' re going to Iose.
You' d better run fast!
Look out!
I' m coming in close.
Keep America clean.
Danny, you win.
Let' s take the rest of this walking.
Give me your hand.
Isn' t it beautiful?
Dead end.
We made it.
Isn' t it beautiful?
It' s so pretty.
Did you?
Hi, hon.
How' s it going?
Fine.
Get a Iot written today?
The weather forecast said it' s going to snow tonight.
What do you want me to do about it?
Come on, hon.
I just want to finish my work.
I understand.
I' II come back Iater with a couple of sandwiches.
Maybe you' II Iet me read something then.
Wendy...... Iet me explain something to you.
When you come in and interrupt, you' re breaking my concentration.
Understand?
We' re making a new rule:
That means don' t come in.
Do you think you can handle that?
Fine.
Why don' t you start right now and get the fuck out of here?
I knew it.
This is KDK 12 caIling KDK 1.
KDK 12 to KDK 1.
This is KDK 1.
Over.
This is Wendy Torrance at the Overlook Hotel.
Over.
But our telephones aren' t doing too weIl.
Over.
Over.
Any chance of them being repaired soon?
Most winters they stay that way untiI spring.
Over.
It' s one of the worst we' ve had for years.
Anything else we can do for you, Mrs. Torrance?
Over.
And, Mrs. Torrance?
It might be a good idea if you leave your radio on all the time.
We' II do that.
It was reaI nice talking to you.
Over and out.
HeIlo, Danny.
Come and play with us.
Come and play with us, Danny.
Forever...
... and ever...... and ever.
Tony...... I' m scared.
Remember what Mr. Hallorann said.
"It' s just like pictures in a book, Danny.
It isn 't real. "
Can I go to my room and get my fire engine?
Come here for a minute first.
How' s it going, Doc?
Yes, Dad.
Good.
I want you to have a good time.
I am, Dad.
Do you feeI bad?
I' m just a Iittle bit tired.
Then why don' t you go to sleep?
I can' t.
I got too much to do.
Do you Iike this hotel?
I do.
Don' t you?
I guess so.
Good.
I want you to Iike it here.
I wish we could stay here forever...... and ever...... and ever.
You would never hurt Mommy or me, would you?
What do you mean?
That I would hurt you?
No, Dad.
You sure?
Yes, Dad.
I love you, Danny.
I love you more than anything else...... in the whole world.
I would never do anything to hurt you...... never.
You know that, don' t you?
Yes, Dad.
Mom, are you in there?
What happened?
Honey...... what' s wrong?
I had the most...... terrible nightmare I ever had.
- It was the most horrible dream.
ReaIly.
I dreamed that I...... that I kiIled you and Danny.
I cut you up into Iittle pieces.
My God.
I must be Iosing my mind.
Everything' s going to be aII right.
Let' s get up off the floor.
Danny!
Everything' s okay!
Just go play in your room for a while.
Your dad' s just got a headache.
Danny, mind what I say.
Go play in your room.
Honey, Iet me just get him out of here.
I' II be right back.
Why don' t you mind me?
Oh, my God.
What happened to your neck?
What happened to your neck?
You did this to him...... didn' t you?!
You son of a bitch!
You did this to him!
Didn' t you?!
How could you?!
I' d give anything for a drink.
I' d give my goddamn soul...... for just a glass of beer.
Hi, Lloyd.
A Iittle slow tonight, isn' t it?
Yes it is, Mr. Torrance.
What wiII it be?
I' m awfuIly glad you asked me that, Lloyd...... because I just happen to have two twenties...... and two tens right here in my waIlet.
I was afraid they' d be there untiI next April.
So here' s what:
You slip me a bottle of bourbon...... a Iittle glass and some ice.
You can do that, can' t you?
You' re not too busy, are you?
I' m not busy at aIl.
Good man.
You set them up...... and I' II knock them back, one by one.
White man' s burden.
Say, Lloyd...... it seems I' m temporarily Iight.
How' s my credit in this joint, anyway?
Your credit' s fine, Mr. Torrance.
That' s sweIl.
I always Iiked you.
You were always the best of them.
Best goddamn bartender...... from Timbuktu to Portland, Maine.
Or Portland, Oregon, for that matter.
Thank you for saying so.
I didn' t.
I wouldn' t touch one hair on his goddamn Iittle head.
I love the Iittle son of a bitch.
Any fucking thing for him.
As Iong as I Iive...... she' II never Iet me forget what happened.
I did hurt him once, okay?
Completely unintentional.
In this book i collected all the prophecies of eibon, handed down from generation to generation over more then 4, 000 years.
You ungodly warlock.
Because of you this hotel and this town will be cursed forever.
The seven dreaded gateways are concealed in 7 cursed places.
Woe be unto him who ventures near without knowledge.
Be careful what you do because this hotel was built on one of the 7 doors of evil and only i could save you.
Woe be unto him who opens one of the 7 gateways to hell, because through that gateway evil will invade the world.
I told you martin, we can' t.
All i inherited was the hotel, nothing else.
But it' d be such a pity not to.
Let me at least finish the plans.
No forget it.
I won' t even charge you for it.
Look, really it' s not the case.
Ljust wanted to clean up the outside walls a bit, and maybe tidy up inside a bit and then, well, business starts booming we' il see.
It' s better we do it now because wait four months or six and believe me, you are going to lay out.
You can' t imagine the effect that double digit inflation is having on housing.
Hi larry.
How' s it going?
Oh, good morning.
I' m gonna have this whole wall finished by tonight.
Great.
Bye.
Outside is ok.
Good old 1800th louisiana, but the interior.
I mean, hotels just aren' t...
the eyes!
The eyes!
The eyes!
Eyes!
Arthur.
Where' s that doctor?
He' s on his way.
This man needs to get to a hospital.
I' il clean up the wounds first.
Have you got any water?
I' m sorry, but till the plumber comes back i' m afraid i can' t get you any.
Then we' d better move him right now.
Give me a hand, will you?
Take the legs... gently... ok, up, right.
It' s ok.
How can i check up on him?
Ask me at the hospital.
John mckay.
We' re off to a great start.
Let' s just hope there isn' t any lasting damage.
I sure would like to know how a man can fall off a scaffolding 6 feet wide.
Liza.
Hey, look at this picture.
Weird.
I wasn' t aware that you had already scored a client.
Client?
There isn' t a soul here!
I guess it must have been arthur.
Yeah.
Hey, is anybody home?
Just a minute, i' m coming!
Are you the plumber?
Joe, right?
Yes ma' m.
What' s the trouble?
I' m afraid i can' t tell you.
Nothing comes out of the faucets, and yet somehow the basement is flooded.
You tell me.
The whole basement?
And how!
Well, let' s take a look.
Ok!
Follow me, this way.
Off we go.
I hope it isn' t too serious.
Watch out, the stairs are really slippery.
I' m an old sewer rat.
Well, here it is.
How long do you think it will take?
It' il take as long as it takes!
Martha?
I made this little pathway to the far end just forjoe.
Thank you martha.
Well, i' il go take that look.
Where is arthur?
He is upstairs, tidying up, we' re doing our best to help yeah, i know.
Thank you.
Listen, i' il be going into town later.
Would you please make me out a list of all the things we' il need?
Ok, don' t worry.
Arthur!
What are you doing in my room?
I was looking for keys.
Which keys?
I told ma i was gonna clean up the rooms but some of them are locked.
Well, ljust have to find those keys, arthur, won' t i?
Or else we' il simply call a locksmith.
In the meantime, could you go up on the roof and check the chimney?
I think it is clogged.
I heard a car drive up before.
Was it joe?
Yeah.
Why??
You are liza, aren' t you?
Yes.
My name is emily.
I' ve been looking foryou.
Joe!
Joe!
Joe!
Arthur?
Arthur?
I don' t understand, emily.
How do you... don' t worry.
And there' s always dickey here.
Come liza.
I' il show you the way.
Joe?
Emily.
Why did you say i must give up the hotel?
I can' t explain it to you.
Just take my word for it.
Go back to where you came from and hurry.
What' s the matter?
I don' t know.
He is in amazingly good condition for a corpse who is supposed to have been dead for 6 years.
Said to open him up and see what he had for breakfast.
How about we give it a try with... forget it.
You wanna wire this old guy into your brain wave machine?
Why not?
Okay.
Okay.
But you' re on your own with this one.
I warn you though.
When i get back, i' m gonna give him an autopsy.
Harris here.
Miller want you up at 24 on the double.
I' m on my way honey.
Wait here for me jill.
I won' t be long.
Mommy!
Mommy!
So, what did you do in the big apple?
Just about everything a girl could do without losing her good english breeding and reputation, modeling, dancing, secretary.
When this letter arrived announcing the inheritance.
Big surprise, uh?
More or less.
I mean, i knew i had a rich uncle who was a bachelor with a lot of real estate imagined for one day to the next but i neverthat i' d be running a hotel.
Tell me, with all those accidents, you know, joe the plumber and the house painter.
Do you think you' il give up now?
I couldn' t do that if i wanted to.
This is my last chance.
Either i run this hotel or i go on relief.
Well i tell you what, when you get the hotel fixed up, i' il come and stay there so you can book me a room now.
Sure, you' ve got it.
The best in the house.
Of course.
How long do you think it' il be before it' s ready?
I don' t know, it' s driving on so much.
Arthur and martha are more of a hindrance then a help.
They just can' t seem to get it together.
Well, if you hired them, you can fire them.
But, i can' t fire them.
They came with the hotel.
Strange, i' ve never heard of them.
Dr. Mckay, dr.
Mckay, you' re wanted on the phone.
It' s the hospital.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Oh... harris, hi.
What?
... in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us ourtrespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
Lead us not to temptation, but deliver us from evil.
Amen.... and as we commit the souls of joe and mary ann, to ourfather in heaven we pray together, oh merciful father, watch overjill, their daughter whom joe and mary ann' s untimely departure has left alone in this world, as a helpless child confort her, and guide her, and give her strenght we ask this, o lord, in the name of the father and of the son, and of the holy ghost.
Amen.
Courage, my child
liza!
Liza!
Liza!
Emily?
Why didn' t you listen to me liza?
We blind see things more clearly.
I wanted to spare you, but now i' il have to tell you everything.
60 years ago everybody in this hotel disappeared.
Every last person.
A painter called schweik, who lived here closeted in his room had found a key.
What key?
The seven gateways to hell.
This house was constructed on one of the... who else is here?
There' s nobody here.
I can feel a presence.
Somebody else is in here.
No, emily.
Nobody is here.
Yes, it' s him.
He is here again.
He has come back to the hotel.
Get ahold of yourself, emily, please.
What is this?
That?
A painting, just an old painting.
There' s the bell.
That' s the bell from room 36.
That' s where he was killed, in his room!
36 was schweik' s room, the man who found the key.
He has returned, liza.
Don' t ever enterthat room.
Now look emily, i' ve lived in ny all my life and if there is one thing i' ve learned not to believe in it' s ghosts.
I was lucky to inherit this hotel.
The first good break i' ve had.
It' il take more than a faulty electrical contact or some crazy story to make me give it up.
Emily!
Emily!
Emily!
Liza!
John!
Hey, hey, calm down, calm down.
Take it easy, take it easy, come on.
But i saw him.
There, nailed to the wall.
He... see these nails.
Well, they certainly look old, but this seems more like rust than blood.
Now it seems so impossible, so absurd.
And yet... i don' t know.
Now look, come and tell me exactly what you saw, hmm?
No, never mind.
It' s useless.
I guess i must have a pretty wild imagination.
Hmm?
I got carried away with that story that emily told me about room 36.
Emily?
Who' s emily?
The blind girl that lives in the old house by the crossroads.
There' s no blind girl living there.
And i know everyone around here.
The book!
The what?
The book that was on the desk.
It' s gone!
Open two walls and enterthe basement and then you' il have a room for a kitchen and maybe for a laundry.
Huh?
What do you think of that?
I don' t have the money.
Do whateveryou want to as long as it doesn' t cost.
I have carte blanche?
Carte blanche, but not a blank check.
Okay?
Okay.
Well, the first thing we do is bring someone in to pump out all the water.
That i can get done real cheap.
And then... oh, and on the other side i' il make a living room and a game room.
Have you got the original plans of the cellar by any chance?
There was another book here.
A different one.
You wanna buy the book no, not this one.
The one that was here before, just a second ago.
That book has been there fortwo years.
Nobody wants to buy it.
It' s very nice though.
Very, very interesting.
Liza!
What' s wrong?
About the book?
I was just looking for... what?
Is anything the matter?
You look sick.
You' re sure it' s nothing?
I' m just a little tired that' s all.
I think i' m beginning to see things.
I get the picture.
Later i' il have to go to the town hall and dig out the originals from the files.
Re- open that hotel?
Uh, huh.
Anyway, all the turn of the century building plans are on those upper shelves there.
They should be under what the cards say, m 13, 012.
Well, let' s get them down and look at them.
Avery.
You haven' t heard about ourtown employees latest labor victory?
It tooks three weeks strike to win.
Yeah.
It was something about lunch.
An earlier break.
I' m sure you' il be ok on your own.
I' il be out until one or a quarter of.
You feel completely at home now, you hear?
Have a happy lunch.
Thank you.
I' m gonna lock the door, that way you won' t be disturbed.
First from one to two, and now from twelve to one.
Three weeks of picketing.
A great labor victory!
Now, then.
M 13, 012. manderville.
7 doors hotel.
Hotel... 7 doors.
What the...?!
"The 7 dreaded gateways to hell are concealed in 7 cursed places."
"And the day the gates of hell are opened, on that day the dead will walk the earth."
Good boy, dicky, good boy.
Who' s there?
Who' s there?
Answer me!
I know you' re there!
Where are you?
Who are you?
Who?
I know it' s you.
I can sense it.
What do you want from me now?
What is it now?
Schweik, i know you' re here.
No, no, schweik!
Go away!
I don' t want to go back!
You can' t take me.
I don' t want to go back.
Stop tormenting me!
Don' t get any closer!
Don' t get any closer!
No!
Go away!
Leave me in peace.
Don' t touch me!
You can' t take me back!
Go!
Go away!
No!
I never spoke.
You can' t condemn me!
I don' t want to go back!
Attack dicky!
Attack dicky!
Attack!
Dicky!
Dicky!
Attack!
Attack!
Chase them away!
Attack!
Get rid of them, dicky!
Attack!
Dicky!
Attack!
Good boy.
Good boy.
Good boy, dicky.
You made them go away.
Martha?
Arthur?
Arthur?
No!
No!
No!
Liza!
Liza!
Stop it!
Liza, come on, it' s me.
Come on, calm down.
Come sit down, i saw arthur, come on sit down.
He was dead but...
liza, liza, stop it!
I' m sick of hearing all these stories.
What stories??
Well, like the first one.
There was a man nailed to the wall in room 36.
And the blind girl that doesn' t exist.
She does exist.
I saw her.
I spoke to her.
The girl that lives in the old house by the crossroads?
Yes!
That house has been abandoned forthe last 50 years.
But that' s not true.
It' s not possible.
I was there!
I mean i went there.
I was there.
Yes, i know you were there.
I found the book you left for me to read.
You found the book?
And i read it.
What did it say?
Show me where is arthur.
Here?
And he tried to kill you?
Huh?
Please john, you must believe me.
I swear.
So where is arthur now?
But i don' t know!
He attacked me!
I was trying to break free.
He was here!
The cuts on my... there are no!
I must be going crazy.
Perhaps, or else... who are you liza?
Who are you really?
John, i don' t understand you.
What a question.
Why do you ask?
Because according to the book of eibon, this hotel is one of the 7 gateways to hell.
"And you will face the sea of darkness and all therein that may be explored."
Strange.
There isn' t a soul in sight.
Yea.
Well, we' il be at the hospital pretty soon.
I wanna talk to harris.
Where is everybody?
Let' s try the laboratory.
But john... no, liza, i' m a doctor, and i won' t accept irrational explanations i want to talk to harris.
I' m gonna call the fbi.
John!
The elevator!
Get the hell going!
Jill?
Jill!
Jill!
Harris!
What the hell is going on around here?
I don' t know.
I think i' m going crazy.
Here they come!
It' s jill.
She was in the autopsy theater all alone.
This way.
Come on.
Come on.
No!
We' re underthe hotel.
Impossible!
It' s impossible!
It' s crazy.
What' s happened?
Why are we here?
Come on.
"And you will face the sea of darkness and all therein that may be explored."
Alex.
He' s picking you up at 3. 30 tomorrow.
The bus leaves the high school for the airport around 5. 00.
How' s my suitcase working out for you?
Mom, you got to leave that on.
The tag made the last flight without the plane crashing... so I figure it' s got to be on or with the bag.
For luck.
Where would you get a nutball idea like that?
I' m still here.
So, seventeen, on the loose... senior trip with your friends in Paris... ten days in the springtime.
Live it up.
You got your whole life ahead of you.
There you go.
Carter, you dick.
- Thanks.
Come on, let' s get your stuff together.
Hey, Christa.
Hi, Blake.
- What are you doing?
All right.
Yeah, Dad, we' re all set.
Does that mean go?
Don' t know.
Have a great time.
Thanks, Dad.
- Both of us.
- Let' s go.
- Alex, take care of them.
- I will.
Didn' t think anything could look worse than my yearbook photo.
How do you think I feel having to look at you?
What the fuck does he want?
The airport does not endorse solicitors.
Death is not the end.
It will be for you if you harass my students.
Hare Rama.
I have to ask you a few questions this evening.
Did you pack your bags yourself?
Mr Browning?
Have you received any packages from persons unknown to you?
- Same as your birthday.
9. 25.
Your birthday' s the same as your departure time.
George, Dad said both of us.
Knock it off.
- Thanks.
- You' re welcome.
Let' s go take a shit.
- Take a shit by yourself.
Take some knowledge.
The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets.
Say halfway through the flight... your body wants that aeroplane food out.
You got to go torque a wicked cable.
Then directly after you, walks in Christa or Blake.
That reflexive gag at the back of their throat?
John Denver.
Died in a plane crash.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience.
At this time, we would like to begin preboarding... of Volee Air flight 180 to Paris through gate 46.
How did we lose him?
Go.
Go.
That hurt.
It' d be a fucked- up God to take down this plane.
A really fucked- up God.
- Hello.
Can you switch seats with Christa?
It' s a urinary tract infection.
Let' s go ask Alex.
Could you trade seats so Blake and I could sit together?
She asked Tod, but he had some medical thing.
Please?
You' re so sweet.
Thanks, Alex.
Thank you, Alex.
You' re welcome.
You really think we' d titty- fuck them over Greenland?
Because of you, I got to watch fucking "Stuart Little."
Thank you.
Thanks, man.
That' s my seat right there.
Thanks.
May I have your attention?
Flight attendants, prepare for departure.
Could you trade seats so Blake and I could sit together?
She asked Tod, but he had some medical thing.
Please?
What' s up, dude?
- ls there a problem, sir?
- What' s your fucking problem?
This fucking plane' s going to explode!
- Shut up, Browning.
- You' re so not funny.
- lf this is a joke...
- It' s not a joke!
Alex, take it easy.
- It' s going down!
We' il remove you if this continues.
I' il fucking remove myself!
- That' s my seat.
Sit tight.
See how he' s doing.
- Get the fuck off me!
- Let go, jerk.
- That' s my call.
- Wait, please!
Please.
You must understand my position.
I do, and I apologize for Alex... but one of us needs to be on that plane.
I cannot let those students go to Paris for ten days...
Sit the fuck down, Carter!
One of you can go on the flight.
Larry.
One of us can get back on.
The rest can take an 11. 10 flight.
You know the French thing.
It' s fine.
Hi, I was in the bathroom, and the lock was stuck...
Wait, I didn' t fight with anyone!
Damn!
I called your parents.
They' re on their way.
Tell me what happened.
I saw it.
I saw it.
I saw it on the runway, I saw it take off...
I saw out my window, I saw the ground.
The left side blows up and the whole plane explodes.
And it was so real, like how everything happens.
Been on a lot of planes that blew up?
You fell asleep.
All because Browning has a bad fucking dream?
The plane, it' s going to blow up!
Fuck you, Horton.
The only trip you' re taking is to the fucking hospital!
Get off him!
Alex, stop it!
There they go, here we stay.
You' re paying for my trip.
I wish you were on that plane!
You' re looking at me as if I caused this.
I didn' t cause this.
Are there any survivors?
How should I know?
- You think I' m some...
- He' s not a witch.
National Transportation and Safety Board.
They are on the way.
ls there anyone here who feels they might need... medical attention or spiritual counselling?
What' s going on?
Are there any survivors?
The cause for the explosion is still undetermined.
The Nassau County authorities are on the scene... naval search and rescue en route.
This is Agent Schreck.
We' re with the FBl.
I understand how you all must be feeling... and I know it' s going to be difficult... but we need to ask questions regarding today' s events... while they' re still fresh in your mind.
This will prove invaluable to our rescue attempts... and any potential criminal investigation.
You said, "Listen to me.
"This plane will explode on takeoff."
How did you know that?
I got this feeling.
This weird feeling.
On board, did you take any sleeping pills... narcotics, hallucinogens?
Do you take any drugs?
I saw it.
I saw the plane explode.
Did the weird feelings have anything to do... with your saying you wished Carter Horton was on it... just before it exploded?
Then why' d you say it?
I didn' t really think it was going to happen.
lf that' s the case, Alex... why did you really get off the plane?
My brother George... he told me to go keep an eye on Alex.
And so he stayed and...
He told me to get off the plane.
Larry Murnau said I should get back on... but I told him that he should go.
I sent him back on the plane.
Nobody forced you off the plane.
You said you weren' t friends with those that were... so, Clear, why did you get off the plane?
Because I saw and I heard Alex...
and I believed him.
Thank you for the ride.
You are looking at the first piece of debris... to wash ashore from Volee Air flight 180... which erupted shortly after a 9. 25 p. m. takeoff... from John F. Kennedy Airport in New York.
Coast Guard and naval search and rescue efforts... are continuing at this moment... even as jet fuel burns on the ocean' s surface.
Authorities are pessimistic about the possibility... of finding anyone alive from the ill- fated flight.
All 287 passengers are feared dead.
Amongst the travellers... a class of forty students and four teachers... from Mount Abraham High School in south- east New York... en route to Paris on a field trip.
There are reports several students... were removed from the aircraft moments before departure... however, investigators remain guarded... about the specifics of this incident.
Authorities from National Transportation and Safety... and the Federal Bureau of lnvestigation... have arrived at JFKto begin the initial investigation.
Eyewitnesses at the airport, as well as on Long lsland... report seeing the plane explode.
Thirty- nine days have passed... since we lost our thirty- nine loved ones... friends, and teachers.
As each day passes... without a determining cause for the accident... we ask ourselves, "Why?"
"Ecclesiastes" tells us...
"than fish taken in the fatal net...
"or birds trapped in the snare.
"when the time falls suddenly upon them."
And so, before we can heal... before we escape the presence of death and time... we must mourn and celebrate theirs... with this memorial.
I hope you don' t think because my name ain' t on this wall... that I owe you anything.
I don' t.
All I owe these people is to live my life to the fullest.
Why don' t you stay off the J. D., then?
Don' t you ever fucking tell me what to do.
I control my life, not you.
I' m never going to die.
I took my driver' s test last week at the DMV.
It' s the lowest score you can get, but I passed.
The thing is, when I was done with the test... you know the guy that drives with you during the test?
Anyways, he goes....
"Young man, you' re going to die at a very young age."
ls that true?
Not now, not here, not ever, Billy.
Fuck.
Don' t talk to me.
You scare the hell out of me.
I miss you, you know?
Yeah, I miss you, too.
But my father, he doesn' t understand.
Look, when he gets over this thing... you and me, we' il road trip to the city... catch the Yanks.
We' il do that.
I better go.
This thing Ms Lewton showed me in class... they' re going to let me read it.
It says what I' m feeling.
Take care, man.
Because of you, I' m still alive.
Thank you.
We say that the hour of death cannot be forecast.
But when we say this... we imagine that the hour is placed... in an obscure and distant future.
It never occurs to us that it has any connection... with the day already begun... or that death could arrive this same afternoon.
This afternoon which is so certain... and which has every hour filled in advance.
What happened?
Where' s Tod?
Get out of here.
- Didn' t you see it?
- What happened?
You caused Tod so much guilt over George... he took his own life.
He wouldn' t do that.
He said we' d be friends again after you got better.
Why would he make plans if he was going to kill himself?
Mr Waggner.
Almost autumn.
It' s only the end of June.
Yeah, but everything' s always in transition.
lf you focus, even now, just one week into summer... you can almost feel autumn coming.
I like being able to see the future.
Why were you at Tod' s house last night?
I' ve seen enough TV to know... the FBl doesn' t investigate teen suicides.
That means, one... they still don' t have a clue what caused the crash.
Two -- they haven' t ruled out anything... and the fact seven people got off the plane... is probably weird enough.
Not to mention, one of those people had a vision... of the plane exploding... minutes before it actually did is highly suspicious.
And it doesn' t help that the visionary' s friend... just committed suicide.
Why were you there last night?
You know what this is?
This is a...
This is Springy Head Guy.
It' s you.
Not a likeness.
It' s how you make me feel, Alex.
I' m sorry.
Like you, the sculpture doesn' t even know... what or why it is.
It' s reluctant to take form... and yet creating an absolute... but incomprehensible attraction.
ln four years of high school... we haven' t said one word to each other.
At that moment, on the plane, I felt what you felt.
I didn' t even know where those emotions came from... until you started freaking out.
I didn' t see what you saw, but I felt it.
You can still feel it, can' t you?
Something from that day is still with you.
I know because I can still feel you.
That' s why I was there last night.
I' ve never dealt with death before.
This could all be in our head.
It just feels like it' s all around us.
lt?
Of us.
I don' t know.
I wish I could see him one last time.
Maybe I would know.
Then let' s go see him.
Easy.
Gives me a rush.
This place?
Doing something I' m not supposed to.
Come on.
Hurry up.
- ls that him?
- I think.
That' s him.
Whatever it was that made him Tod is definitely gone.
Holy Christ!
Please.
You' il wake the dead.
Chemicals.
The vascular flush creates cadaveric spasms.
Look, I' m his friend...
I know who you are.
What are all those tiny marks?
Cuticle lacerations from pulling at the wire.
Pulling at the wire?
It was an accident.
ln death, there are no accidents... no coincidences, no mishaps... and no escapes.
What you have to realize is we' re all just a mouse... a cat has by the tail.
Every single move we make... from the mundane to the monumental... the red light that we stop at or run... the people we have sex with or won' t with us... aeroplanes that we ride or walk out of... it' s all part of death' s sadistic design...
leading to the grave.
Design.
Does that mean if... you figure out the design, you can cheat death?
Alex, you' ve already done that... by walking off the plane.
Your friend' s departure... shows that death has a new design for all of you.
Now you have to figure out... how and when it' s coming back at you.
Play your hunch... if you think you can get away with it.
But remember... the risk of cheating the plan... of disrespecting the design... could incite a fury to terrorize even the Grim Reaper.
And you don' t even want to fuck with that Mack Daddy.
Well...
I' m sorry we broke in, and...
No harm, no foul.
I' il see you soon.
The mortician said that death has a design.
I' m talking about omens.
How do we know, that just by sitting here... by sipping this coffee or breathing the air... or even crossing the intersection... we haven' t started in motion... the events that will some day lead to our death... forty years from now, ten years, tomorrow?
We don' t, unless we open ourselves up... to the signs it' s willing to show us.
I don' t understand.
Did you see Tod die?
Did it happen again, like on the plane?
No, it didn' t, but it might as well have.
This is a message from something, Clear... or someone, hinting at a design.
Total bullshit.
Coffee starts with a "C" and ends with an "E".
We' il choke to death?
I want to hear you... but we' il go nuts if you start with this shit.
The mortician said that death has a design, right?
Now, what if you, me, Tod, Carter...
Terry, Billy, Mrs Lewton messed up that design?
For whatever reason, I saw death' s plan... and we cheated it.
What if we were not meant to get off that plane?
What if it still is our time?
lf it is, then it' s not finished... and we will die.
Now, not later.
Unless we find the patterns and cheat it again.
After hearing you, I do believe... that Tod killed himself.
Baby, come on, not now.
Let it go.
- When are you moving?
- That' s too bad.
- Carter, you dick!
Losing our favourite teacher.
Guys, there' s something I need to tell you.
Lived here your whole life, and now she' s gotta move...
We' re in danger!
Both of you!
Get over it.
I will not let this plane crash... be the most important thing in my life!
I' m moving on, Carter... and if you want to waste your life... beating the shit out of Alex every time you see him... then you can just drop fucking dead!
ls Alex there?
Yeah, just a minute.
It' s Clear again.
You want to talk to her?
Can I get him to call you back?
Sure.
Bye.
She' s concerned about you.
I' m concerned about you.
Why won' t you talk to her?
Or to me?
Dad, you and Mom have both been a big help... but there' s something I need to understand... before I can talk.
The National Transportation Safety Board... has a new theory tonight on the cause of the explosion... of Volee Air flight 180.
Officials believe deterioration of silicone insulation... on an electrical connector to the scavenger pump... may have leaked combustible fluids.
A spark beneath the coach cabin in the fuselage... may have ignited the fuel line, proceeding to the fuel pump... which would have set off the catastrophic explosion.
The path of the explosion.
First was Tod, then it was Terry.
They' re dying in the order they would' ve died.
That' s death' s design.
Ms Lewton' s next.
Whenever I can fall asleep, I see Terry Chaney... and in the day, out of nowhere...
I hear the sound of my own voice in my head... saying to Larry Murnau...
"Get on the plane."
Everything reminds me of that day.
I' m hoping a change will help.
It' s just that...
I lived here my whole life, you know?
And everywhere I looked were great memories.
And now all I see is Larry and those kids.
Just looking out my own front yard... makes me feel nothing but fear.
Right.
I need Agent Schreck.
What are you doing here?
I was just... checking the air in the tyre to make sure it' s safe.
Get in the car.
Put on your seat belt.
I believe that... that Ms Lewton is next.
Next?
Yeah, next, because... there' s this pattern that' s occurring.
You noticed that, too?
Mom' s favourite.
So what about this pattern?
Did you see it in one of your visions?
Did you catch it in some TV static?
I never asked for what happened on the plane.
It' s fine.
But I saved six lives on that plane.
Six lives, and everybody in my entire school... thinks I' m a freak.
I' m not suffering from post- traumatic stress.
I don' t have a narcissistic deity complex.
I' m not going Dahmer on you guys.
This just is.
There is a pattern for you.
There is a design for everyone, and I don' t know how yet... but I' m going to break this one.
You came to our attention... because you were under suspicion in this plane explosion.
I know you didn' t blow up the plane.
We were ready to move on... but then the other survivors started to die.
First, your friend Tod... then Terry Chaney, while you were at the scene.
And tonight, we pick you up at Val Lewton' s house.
Nobody has control over life and death... unless they are taking lives and causing death.
Can you promise me no one else is going to die?
I' m sorry.
Go ahead.
Get out of here.
Thank you.
That kid gives me the creeps.
We got nothing.
That' s not what I' m talking about.
There were a couple of moments... where I almost believed him.
Don' t take this the wrong way... but sometimes you give me the creeps.
It' s a stupid mug.
You' re out of here.
You' il be gone.
All right, just stay still, OK?
Oh, God, Ms Lewton.
Dude.
I don' t know where he is.
He' s not talking to me.
Why?
Because I didn' t believe him.
lf he does contact you, I think it would be... in the best interest of your safety if you called us.
Now, here' s my card.
Toll- free number.
lnteresting work.
Carter, you dick!
What are you doing?
Terry should be on this wall.
Shit.
Why' d you want us to meet you here?
They' re watching me to see if I go to Alex.
That' s why you' re taking me.
Why would I want to see him?
Because he knows which one of us is next.
I' m getting a vision.
You' re the next one, man.
Man, why' d you say that?
Because if you say another word, I' il fucking kill you.
He could be anywhere from here to a mile down the road... so you guys start that way and meet back in the middle.
It' il take half the time.
Do you think they' re still up there?
Somehow, flight 180, are they still in flight?
Somewhere... are they safe?
I used to worry so much about my parents dying.
Lying awake at night, just worrying.
Most kids do, I guess.
Most kids never have it happen.
When I was ten... my dad went into a 7- Eleven for cigarettes.
A guy blew his head off.
She married this asshole who my mom with my real dad... would have crossed the street to avoid this guy.
He didn' t really want a kid... so my mom didn' t, either, anymore.
lf that was the design for my father and family... then fuck death!
God, I have thought a lot about that somewhere.
It exists, that place... where my dad is safe.
Where he had a full pack of cigarettes and kept driving.
Where me and my mom and my dad are still together... and have no idea about this life here.
Where our friends are still in the sky.
Where everyone gets a second chance.
Alex, we can' t give up.
I can' t go home, because after Mrs Lewton... they' re looking for me.
It' s a couple of miles from my house.
Browning, you fucking warlock... did you hear about Ms Lewton or what?
Why do you think I was hiding?
Billy told the FBl he saw you running from her house.
They blame me for Tod, for her... for the fucking plane crash.
The fire caramelized her blood.
Your shoe prints were in it, your fingerprints on the knives.
I' m not talking about if you did it.
Or even if you knew she was dead.
Did you know she was going to be next before she was?
Yeah, I did.
All right, out of us... who' s next to see it?
Please... tell me I' m going to see the Jets win a Super Bowl.
It' s me, right?
That' s why you' re not saying.
I should have felt up Tammy in the pool that time.
He didn' t say anything.
Just drive.
You have a responsibility to tell me.
Think it' s easier to know?
It' s fucking harder.
You get off having control over me?
Let me decide how to deal with it.
It doesn' t matter who' s next...
'cause we' re all on the same list.
Fuck.
Really?
What' s the fucking point?
Me and Terry' il be back together on the other side... so why wait any longer?
What are you doing?
Carter, slow down.
- Slow down, Carter!
May as well go out on my own free will!
Not with us in the fucking car!
Jesus, Carter!
Carter, stop the car!
What' s the fucking worry if it ain' t your time?
You all wouldn' t get shit.
It doesn' t work that way!
I fucking hated French class!
- That' s what I' m doing!
I know what you' re doing, and it' s all right to be scared.
I' m not afraid.
I control my death.
You don' t have to prove how big your balls are!
Stop driving like such an asshole.
What are you doing?
Jesus Christ!
Put your hands back on the wheel!
- Back on the wheel!
I am so close to puking right now.
Stop it and stop this fucking car!
Damn it, I want you to stop this car right now!
- Open the door, Billy.
Move the fucking car!
- Open the fucking door.
- Move the car.
- Open it!
- Billy, open the door!
Don' t do this.
God damn it!
Get out of the fucking car!
Carter, listen to me!
It' s not the way!
Get out of the car!
It' s coming!
It ain' t my time.
Shit.
This isn' t the way.
Get out of the car!
Get out!
I can' t get out!
Man, he really is next.
Get out!
I saw it!
You scared now?
It broke!
Bullshit!
He saved your life again.
You' re next, Carter!
I' m staying the fuck away from you!
I don' t need it ever!
He' s next!
I' m not dead!
You will be.
You' re dead... and you ain' t taking me with you!
You were after Lewton.
That' s the design!
You should be fucking dead!
You' re the devil!
I knew it would rip!
I saw it!
I saved him!
Because I saved him, it skipped Carter... and went to the next person in the path of the explosion!
I have to see it.
Then I intervene... and if I intervene, I cheat the design.
Are you God now?
God' s not afraid to die.
Baby, you are losing it.
The police will be here.
You can hide out and get your head together.
After Billy, I' m next.
I' m next.
Then me.
Listen, I' m not going to let it happen.
Listen to me.
Why don' t you two get the fuck out of here?
Rusted.
Tetanus.
Nice one.
I overlooked it.
You fuck!
I can beat you.
Maybe not forever... but I got this cabin rigged to beat you now!
She was there a minute ago.
What are you talking about?
I' m not turning him in.
It' s too dangerous for him out there alone.
I go with you.
You can' t.
Just tell us where he is.
Wait at home.
I give you my word... we will bring him in safely in protective custody.
I never moved.
I would have been up next to Tod.
Why didn' t I remember that?
Clear' s seat was in front of mine.
She' s next.
We' re going around!
- There!
- Come on, let' s go!
Alex, we' re trying to help you.
Get away from it!
Run!
We lost him.
No shit.
Don' t move!
Stay there!
Don' t move!
Don' t touch anything.
You' re grounded by the tyres.
The car' s going to explode!
When I do this, it' il skip you, and it' il all be over.
It' s the only way we can cheat death again.
Don' t!
I am not going to let it beat us both.
You know what to do!
I' il always be with you.
Get away from there!
You can' t do this to me.
Come on.
Shit, he' s not breathing.
Stay with me.
Well, we made it.
Paris.
I can' t believe it.
Know what I' m saying?
It' s weird being here, huh?
We finally completed a puzzle.
You know?
To Terry.
And to Tod.
Cheers.
What?
I don' t know.
Sometimes it feels like... you two are the only ones who understand.
It did skip us.
There was a design.
We won.
The only thing we won is a chance at a full life.
A chance that I won' t ever waste.
- About what?
Just let it go, all right?
Hear me out, all right?
- Just listen.
The explosion path determined the order of our deaths.
When I intervened and saved Carter... it skipped him and went to the next person -- Billy.
Then it was Clear.
But I intervened and saved her, so it went to me.
But in my case, no one intervened, right?
I was thrown from that power line... by the explosion, so...
So why did it skip you?
How do we know this isn' t what was meant to happen?
That out of everyone on flight 180... you, me, and Carter were meant to live?
Maybe that was the design all along.
- Or you could still be next.
- Shut up, Carter.
I didn' t make up the rules.
Somebody' s got to intervene before death can skip them.
Alex proved that three times with the plane, me, and you.
For all I know, it could circle back... and get us all again.
But I am the safest fucker in the world... because you' re still next.
Let' s figure out...
I' il meet you back at the hotel.
I' il go with you.
No, just stay here, OK, Clear?
See?
Stop it, Carter.
Alex, wait.
Clear, stay there, OK?
Stay away.
- I told you you were next!
- It skipped me.
So who' s next?
No!
Damn.
Thanks for the present, Bennie.
I guess we' re in the same business.
I' m on my way.
Don' t want to keep the roaches waiting.
- Hey, Mike.
Watch your step.
- Yeah, yeah.
- These tracks are still Iive?
- Williams, over here.
Jesus Christ.
What happened to him?
I don' t think he got electrocuted.
What' s going on with his eyes?
Don' t know yet.
We' il have to wait for the autopsy.
What did this guy see to Ieave an expression Iike that?
Any witnesses?
Not to the accident.
A guy went to grab a paper out of the newsstand.
When he came back, the victim was Iike this.
According to this guy, his eyes were bleeding prior to the swan dive.
- Must have been into computers.
- His name' s Polidori.
He and another guy wrote the book.
Must have tried to stop the train with it.
Had to pry it out of his fingers.
Now all we need is the Ieading Iady.
- You want one?
- No, thanks.
Give it up, Mike.
The Feds are covering that now.
It' s over.
The Feds haven' t done shit.
Not hearing from him doesn' t mean he' s stopped.
Everyone has cases they can' t crack.
Don' t Iet it fuck with your head.
What now?
Get him out of here.
Put him in a holding pen, an empty one.
And get someone to translate whatever Ianguage he' s speaking.
Jesus Christ.
Check him for a passport, an ID, something in fucking English.
It says he' s a German exchange student, Dieter Schrader.
Lives over in the Village.
Here' s the address.
Call the health bunnies, DOH.
Find out if there' s some bug going around, something with bloody eyes.
They can send someone to meet me at his apartment.
Sykes!
Leave the doughnut shop here.
Let' s go!
Come on.
Johnny!
Know any German?
- I can sing "She Loves You" in German.
That' il help.
Police!
Anyone here?
Artists.
- I wouldn' t touch her just yet.
- Jesus.
Actually, Terry Huston, Department of Health.
- Detective Reilly.
You got here fast.
- Yeah.
Goddamn it.
God!
- What do you make of this?
- This is really fascinating.
She' s displaying possible signs of a hemorrhagic virus.
Something Iike Ebola.
Excuse me.
- Reilly.
- "Reilly, we got a problem."
Sykes!
Hello?
What are you doing?
Call the coroner.
Yeah, right.
Jesus.
What is it?
You better get back to the station.
I got a dead girl, a woman from DOH saying we have a serious problem.
- I' m not going anywhere.
- "I think you better get back here."
And bring the DOH with you.
Do you have a plastic bag?
- That' s evidence.
- Yeah.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
- That' s German.
It means "murderer."
- I got that.
What' s with the 48?
Don' t know.
Barlow, what happened here?
The guys said he was talking to himself.
That' s it.
We' il know more when we get him to the morgue.
All right, stand back.
Great.
Should we be in one of those suits they' re wearing?
- We' re probably already infected.
- So we could all just be dying here?
What is it with you people?
You just Iet this shit run wild?
Thanks.
Serum paneI is all clear.
It' s not a virus.
So we' re back at square one.
We' ve got the camcorder.
Sorry about the space patrol, but we had to be sure.
No problem.
I love needles stuck in me.
It' s a hobby of mine.
So you Iike working with bugs and viruses?
Someone' s got to do it.
Otherwise, disease spreads out of control.
You do the same thing.
At Ieast I can see what I' m dealing with.
This other shit creeps me out.
I hate germs and....
Diseases.
What about bugs?
I pretty much hate them too.
- You know you sleep with bugs?
- What?
You sleep with bugs.
No, I don' t, actually.
Yeah, you do.
Everyone does.
Dust mites.
They' re in your carpets, in your bed.
They Iook Iike Iittle Iobsters.
In fact, they' re distant relatives.
- You' re enjoying this, aren' t you?
- I just don' t get out much.
I can see that.
I' m sorry.
I' m being inconsiderate, making you uncomfortable.
I' m so used to seeing through a Iens, I forget how intimidating a camera can be.
I' m doing a Iittle film at the Wilton Theatre, and....
You know, I can' t say this without it sounding Iike a Iine, but....
I was filming you because you happen to be the perfect Ieading Iady.
I can' t promise anything...... but come by the theater tonight...... I' il put you in front of the camera, see what happens.
You have to punch this button.
Then you can record us.
Hard to believe that' s the same guy.
Wait!
- I can watch this Iater.
- Wait a second.
The guy' s Iosing it.
Oh, my God.
Jesus.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
The sun' s out.
Another storm coming.
Shit!
I got a ticket.
Really?
So I' il see you Iater?
Thanks.
Terry, could you come in here?
Mr. Turnbull?
Did you want something?
No.
Yeah.
What happened with the German kids?
Is it Ebola?
No.
I don' t even think it' s a virus.
- What, then?
- I don' t know.
Are you okay?
Let me know if you hear anything, okay?
Sure.
- Where did your computer go?
- Broke.
I sent it in for repair.
- Playing on the Internet too much?
- Yeah.
Well, I' m gonna go finish my report.
Hot!
Cause of death appears to be a stroke brought on by a surge of adrenaline.
No signs of violence except the bleeding.
Hi, you must be Terry Huston.
I' m Thana Brinkman.
One moment.
Severe rupturing to the ocular blood vessels.
I can' t account for it.
Heart is completely engorged.
There' s a massive hemorrhage to the cerebraI cortex.
Death was instantaneous.
End report.
- So it was a stroke.
- Unless Iab tests find something else.
There' s no known virus, bacteria or virulent protein.
Excuse me.
Brinkman.
We have another one.
Oh, my God.
It' s Eddie Turnbull.
Did your husband have any medicaI problems?
Any condition that would contribute to his sudden death?
Other than the chain- smoking and the chronic stress?
I tried to warn him.
It never bothered him untiI these Iast couple of days.
He got kind of sick, started seeing things.
- What kind of things?
- Crazy things.
Said someone was watching him.
There was no Iittle girl.
I think he worked himself to death.
Always working.
Always on his computer.
You know what' s odd, though?
It was Iike he was afraid of it.
Mrs. Turnbull, do you mind if we take this?
Now, you and I share a great responsibility...... to them.
They' ve come to watch but also to Iearn.
We will provide a Iesson...... that reducing relationships...... to anonymous, electronic impulses...... is a perversion.
But here, we offer intimacy.
So tell us about yourself, who you are, where you' re from.
Do you have brothers and sisters?
Did you dream of being a ballerina when you grew up?
You' re gonna kill me, aren' t you?
Of course I' m gonna kill you.
The Internet offers birth, sex, commerce...... seduction, proselytizing, politics...... posturing.
Death is a IogicaI component.
An intimate experience made more so...... by knowing the victim.
So, Karen...... tell us your hopes and dreams.
Nothing.
Nothing in common.
Polidori had a bad childhood, some juvenile stuff.
German kids seem clean.
One was arrested for weed, big surprise.
Turnbull didn' t even have a traffic ticket.
I don' t know.
We gotta be missing something.
They all had the same pattern of bleeding, right?
They all had burnt computers.
Maybe this guy was trying to tell us something.
We gotta get these computers checked out.
I know a forensic programmer, Denise Stone.
She' s worked with me before.
She might be able to help.
We need to find a common Iink on these computers.
- They Iook pretty fried, and this one....
- You think you can do it?
The data should still be retrievable.
Unless the files have been corrupted.
I' il see what I can do.
- You' re the best.
- I know.
Turn around, Bennie.
I don' t want you watching this.
Forty- eight hours.
48.
Do you like to watch?
Okay, I think we get the idea.
I' m waiting for you.
Denise.
Come and find out.
Don' t you want to play with me?
Do you want to hurt me?
You' re lying.
How enticing the smell of cheap perfume can be.
Or is that fear?
I' d Iike to say I can feeI your pain...... but I can' t.
I can' t feeI anything.
I' ve been deprived of that somehow.
I know what I should feel.
I just can' t feeI it.
You can end this Iesson whenever you wish.
Simply ask me to kill you.
She wants to Iive.
Very well.
Let the Iesson commence.
- Denise!
- It' s you.
- Hi.
- What' s wrong?
I' m fine.
I just came to give you this.
- Where did you get this?
- I was there.
What do you mean?
Denise, tell me.
The one thing all the victims have in common...
-... is the Fear site.
- That doesn' t make any sense.
- He wouldn' t use the same site twice.
- Who?
The Doctor.
- Who' s the Doctor?
- A skeleton in my closet.
It' s a Iive- cam death site.
That' s not Iike Turnbull.
Why would he watch that?
People love to see death.
Why do you think the ratings are so high on reality disaster shows?
Maybe it' s a way to find out about death before it' s your turn.
I gotta go.
Wait.
Do you think you can trace who' s running the site?
- Sure.
- Are you sure you' re okay?
Fine.
Denise....
Be careful.
We' il see you soon.
- Hey, come on.
- Where we going?
I did some reading Iast night.
- We' re Iooking for Frank Bryant.
- Over there in the back, hon.
- Last table.
- Okay, thanks.
Frank Bryant?
Are you Mr. Frank...
... Bryant?
- How can I help you, officers?
- How did you know we were cops?
Nobody ever says my name that way except cops.
We' re not here to cause you any trouble.
We read your book, the parts we could understand.
Really?
I didn' t realize my book was still being sold.
- We found it on a dead man.
- A guy named Polidori.
Polidori?
Polidori is dead?
What can you tell us about him?
A good guy.
A decent friend.
Why would he be clutching your book as if it were the Holy Grail?
I couldn' t make much sense of it myself.
That' s because it was a Ioad of shit.
I needed a new car, so I wrote the book.
I was driving along one day, Iooking at the telephone poles and the wires...... and I came up with this idea.
What would happen if you connected a whole bunch of computers together?
You' d get one big computer.
Like a supercomputer.
A neuronet.
Polidori and I used to spend Iong nights talking about it.
He came to believe that the Web could receive energy...
-... store it, send it out.
- Energy.
What kind?
- Here you go.
- Thanks, doll.
Fuck if I know.
I mean, you know....
Negative energy, magnetic fields...... psychic energy stealing your soul.
You know?
- And?
- Polidori believed he knew...... where that site existed.
But then again, Polidori was fucked up.
And now...... he' s dead.
Do you remember the name of the site?
- No idea.
- Do you think he was right?
I never believed a word of it.
But then, I' m drunk by 8 p. m.
It' s noon.
Hey, I' m ahead of the game.
Thank you for your time, Mr. Bryant.
- If we need to reach you....
- I' il be here.
- I have no reason to Ieave.
- Okay.
Oh, my God.
She was the first.
Jeannie Richardson.
He killed her on the Fear site.
He tortures his victims till they beg to die.
- This is the Doctor, right?
- Yeah.
His name' s Alistair Pratt.
Nine months, he fucked with me.
I never even got close.
How come?
After every killing, he' d change the site.
We couldn' t trace it.
What time did Polidori die?
- Turnbull was Iater, about 6, right?
6: 1 5.
Based on that, these victims died two days to the minute...... after they Iogged on to the site.
The German kid was trying to tell us.
Shit.
Denise.
Come on, Denise.
- You trying to get ahold of Denise?
She was supposed to drop something off.
She didn' t show --
Get units over there now!
- What you talking about?
- I said get units over there now!
- She' s not there.
She' s not answering.
- Keep trying.
- Just diaI it again.
- I am.
I just tried.
She' s not there.
I should never have gotten her involved.
I should have fucking warned her.
- It' s not your fault.
- I still don' t get one thing.
Everybody died 48 hours after they went on to that site, right?
Everybody.
Denise doesn' t fit the pattern.
Maybe it was easier to die than face whatever is on the website.
What do you mean?
Eddie Turnbull was terrified of car crashes.
It was a childhood thing.
He was manic about it.
I did some research.
Did you know the German girI was terrified of drowning?
- But she didn' t drown.
- She died in water.
Maybe she died of her greatest fear.
I don' t know, Terry.
I don' t know, I think you' re reaching.
- Maybe.
- Denise got too close.
Someone killed her.
It' s as simple as that.
Can you promise me one thing?
That you won' t visit that site?
God, Denise.
Do you like to watch?
Do you want to see more?
Do you want to hurt me, Mike?
Jeannie!
I know who you are, and I know what you really want.
Time to play.
Time for us to become one.
How do I play?
Find me.
You have 48 hours.
Me.
What happens if I Iose?
You die.
Do you want to play?
What are you afraid of?
God!
Jesus.
Sorry, did I scare you?
Miss, your glove.
Mike?
The website.
I saw her.
- Who did you see?
- The dead girl.
- What dead girl?
- Jeannie Richardson.
I saw her.
Bryant was only half right.
- What do you mean?
- It' s not just energy.
- I don' t understand.
- She' s out there, alive in the wires.
If the will is strong, it can Iive in the objects around it.
You don' t go there, all right?
Promise me.
Tell me you won' t go there!
Don' t go there!
Promise me you won' t go there!
Forty- eight hours.
Hello, Terry.
Are you ready to play?
Why are you killing Mike?
Guilty.
Guilty of what?
Watching.
Are you ready to play?
Yes.
Shit!
- Hey, Sykes.
- Hey.
I need to take a Iook at the Doctor files.
Let' s go in here.
Look.
The Feds are covering this now.
I suppose you think you can do better?
Mike doesn' t Iike people fucking with his -- Stop!
All right!
Jesus- fucking- Christ.
Knock yourself out.
Jeannie Richardson.
Yeah, she was beautiful.
Yeah, Jeannie.
I checked out her addresses.
Shit holes.
Artist/ model, my ass.
You, though...... you' re a different story.
Will you shut the fuck up?
Oh, my God.
Joseph Stalin said that the death of one person is a tragedy...... the death of a million: a statistic.
Your death will give meaning to all us sad, Iittle Iives out there.
See?
The audience is never wrong.
Do you have a moment to talk about your daughter?
This is Jean Marie on the day of her First Communion.
They didn' t know her.
So beautiful.
She was a happy child despite her condition.
- Are you okay?
Did you say, condition?
Jean Marie was a hemophiliac.
Without medication, she could bleed to death from just a scratch.
- Scissors or knives.
That ball....
She always had that thing with her.
WillfuI child, wouldn' t give it up.
It wasn' t untiI she discovered boys that she finally Ieft it behind.
Could you take a Iook at these pictures for me and tell me...... if there' s any places that you recognize in them?
Jeannie used to play there as a child.
You seem Iike you were expecting me.
Just tell me where he is!
Please calm down, or I' il have to ask you to Ieave.
Yeah, okay, I' m sorry.
I' m sorry, I just -- I really need to see him right now.
Okay.
First door on your Ieft.
Are you ready to play?
- Goddamn you, what do you want?
Find me. "
Where are you?
Time is running out.
Leave me alone!
Where are you?
Jeannie?
I found your body.
I know who you are.
And I know what you really want.
Time to play.
Time for us to become one.
Find me.
What time is it?
Mike.
Why?
- You just ran out, didn' t you?
You gotta go back.
No, they can' t help me now.
- I' m drifting in and out more and more.
- Where are we going?
Are you two okay?
You don' t Iook good.
You should see it from our side.
I just thought once we found the body, that would be an end to it.
She had a reason.
Someone performed an autopsy on this body a Iong time ago.
- Look at the incisions.
- It' s Alistair.
He cut her open while she was still alive.
Then he bagged them and sewed her up.
What' s that?
She wants revenge.
Bingo.
Two days.
Knives, Mike.
She died her worst nightmare.
Electrodes are attached to the patient' s head....
Are you in, or what?
- It better be important.
- "Sykes, I need your help."
What?
Call the Feds.
There' s no time for that.
I need backup.
All right.
- Where is it?
- "A cooling tower.
I love watching these old tapes.
You see, I believe death should be repulsive...... so we don' t grow too fond of it.
But...... all this could be avoided...... if you' re ready.
You asked for death...... so I' m no Ionger your murderer.
Drop it now!
I' m not gonna fire a warning shot!
Guns are so impersonaI and artless.
If you want to hurt someone intimately, you have to get up- close and personal.
You already tortured her.
You suffer from the curse of hope.
I hope my first shot blows your fucking head off!
If you kill her, you' il have no one to hide behind.
I don' t want to spoiI things, but if you' re...... expecting the cavalry to save the day, you' re gonna be disappointed.
The cavalry' s right there.
Oh, my God!
Appalling eating habits.
Too bad this show always has the same ending.
No, not this time.
Someone wants revenge.
I guess the fans love a comeback.
Mike.
Mike, Iook at me.
No!
Guilty.
Don' t move!
I know it' s difficult, but please, try not to move.
What' s your name?
Get me out of here.
What we got?
This one was thrown from the car.
I can' t move!
Caucasian male, mid- thirties.
Open wrist fracture, massive head trauma.
I' m not getting a pulse here.
Okay, I need a collar and a saline drip.
Where does it hurt?
I can' t move my fucking legs!
I wanna get a line in before he loses consciousness.
Fourteen gauge or browns?
Fourteens, and some bags, now!
Come on, come on.
I' m gonna give you something for the pain.
We' re gonna get you out of here.
Keep clam.
That' s it.
Good
Move it.
Move it.
Shit!
Nat, could you turn that off, please.
Come on, Nat.
How can you listen to that stuff?
"Cutting up my ho".
It' s just words.
It' s not like anybody takes them seriously.
That' s what I' m worried about.
Besides, it' s the only way I' il ever get to hear them.
Please don' t go on about that concert, okay.
It' s a music festival.
Whatever it is, you' re not going.
But all of my friends are going.
You' ve never let me do anything I wanted to.
That' s not completely true.
You got to do what you wanted today?
While I sat waiting in front of your father' s house in the car for two hours.
You' re listening on your favorite radio station WSNP.
"You' re an easy target.
Don' t make him your pimp. "
What is he going on about?
What is going on up there?
It' s a delay or something.
Thank you, Nat.
What am I?
Like X- ray Vision Man?
Oh, shit.
What?
Oh my God, is somebody dead?
I don' t know, I don' t wanna know.
I do.
Sorry.
Come alone, move it!
What is it?
It' s nothing.
God, mom!
It' s all right, somebody must have put a little doll...
You' re half asleep.
I' m not, I' m fine.
Look, there' s a rest stop coming up.
It' s late, I wanna get home.
You' ve got school tomorrow.
Not if I' m dead I don' t!
Praise the Lord.
Only a Christian could be that happy.
White coffee, please.
A Red Bull.
Leave it to your father to move six hours away to make my life easier.
Look, I' m sorry.
At least you had a weekend.
I had to spend mine, all day yesterday, in the office.
It' s not our fault your job' s not going well.
Who said it' s not going well?
You do.
Thank you.
You' re gonna keep on seeing things in the middle of the road if you keep talking those.
I had n sleep all last week.
You' ve changed.
Good.
Who wants to be the person I used to be?
The person who had me, you mean?
Where are you going?
To phone Geena.
Am I allowed?
Can' t you do that here?
I can' t get a single.
Any other questions?
No.
You ready?
Hey, buddy.
Let' s go.
Let' s wrap it up.
Jerk- off!
Hey, mom.
I told her we wouldn' t mind giving her a ride.
Hi.
She' s going the same way as us.
GAME OVER
Have you got your belly button pierced?
Yeah, I got it done in Rajasthan.
Seat belt, Nat, please.
I' d love to go to India.
It totally turned me around.
Really?
Yeah, the people there are cool, you know.
They don' t worry about material things.
Not like here, where traveling' s about what kind of car you drive.
It should be about broadening the mind.
That' s fine, as long as you' ve got somebody to do the driving.
I can never wait to get home.
To your husband?
She' s divorced.
That' s too bad.
Not necessarily.
So what do your folks say about you going to all these places?
It' s funny, isn' t it?
In India they have religious icons in their car.
What do we have?
Air fresheners.
I picked up this really amazing CD out there.
You wanna hear it?
Fuck me.
So, do you see him?
Your dad?
Sometimes.
What kind of music is this anyway?
Sometimes.
What about yours?
Your family?
We parted ways a long time ago.
You know what they say, you can choose your friends, but yu can' t choose your family.
Who says?
Sometimes family chooses you.
You can just drop me off at this picnic area coming up on the right.
Here.
A very wise person gave that to me once.
He said "nobody in chains soared up to the sun".
Are you sure we can' t take you any further?
No.
Where are you going?
I' m not sure...... but I never get lost any more.
So long.
Nice move.
What?
Oh no, mom, her CD.
Okay, don' t panic.
She' s not here.
Look for her.
Forgot your CD.
She' s gone.
Mom, what are you talking about?
How could she just disappear in thirty seconds?
Don' t worry.
She never gets lost.
Hello?
Oh my God, you' re kidding?
Yeah, yeah, of course I do.
Yeah, but what happens if it doesn' t arrive in time?
We just passed some picnic area with a grizzly bear statue beside the road.
Are you sure?
Okay, we' il do that.
Bye.
Anything to report?
Yeah, I forgot my birthday present.
But dad said he can bring it to the next rest stop.
You' re kidding?
Call him up and tell him to send it in the mail.
Don' t be a drag, he said he could meet us in thirty minutes.
After offering a ride to Ms Barefoot Bombay?
I don' t wanna stop again.
Thank you.
So what did your dad get you, anyway?
I don' t know why you' re asking.
It' s not like you' re interested.
Who are all these people?
What are they all doing here?
What are we doing here?
It' s natural to be afraid of failure.
From creating opportunities for success in the boardroom...... on the playing fields and in the bedroom.
We are bombarded with answers, but are we asking the right questions?
Now, I want you to do something for me.
Close your eyes.
Go on...... just for a minute.
Close your eyes.
I want you to visualize...... a door.
Now...... reach into your pocket...... where there is a key.
Feel it?
That key in your pocket...... unlocks the door.
Only you can open the door.
Behind the door is the truth.
Go on...... unlock the door.
Look inside.
Face the truth...... Senga.
Hi, dad.
Yeah, okay, I' il see you outside.
Stay here.
I' il be back in a minute.
Senga, thanks for waiting.
Which time?
Let' s see it then.
Come on, show me the present.
Well, this is great.
Not only do you lie to me, but you go straight to your father and sweet- talk him.
I didn' t lie.
He asked me what I wanted.
Hold on, I didn' t realize that you two already talked about this.
If you had, do you think she' s old enough to go off on her own for a whole weekend in the wilderness?
She' s not a kid any more.
She' s not exactly an adult either.
If you spent more time with her, you' d understand that.
If you wanna go with her, I don' t have a problem in the world with this.
It' s not about you and me any more.
If you want to make a scene, do it without me, okay?
This is something you two have to sort out.
God, how familiar this sounds!
Dad, we talked about this.
Tell her what you think.
I' il call you, sweetheart, okay?
See you.
We' il do something special.
Dad!
I' m going and you can' t stop me!
You want a bet?
Dad!
Get used to it, Nat.
Bailing out is the only thing your father knows how to do well.
I' m not fucking surprised, with you!
Why is it only your way is right and nobody else has a say in the matter?
No wonder you screwed up your marriage.
Stop it.
You' re afraid I might get pregnant young and screw up my life like you did?
Well I' m not that stupid.
No.
Nat, get in the car now!
I hate you.
Nat?
My daughter, she has long hair...... we were staying right over there a few minutes ago.
Miss?
Pretty face, long hair?
Yes, yes, that' s her.
What?
Natasha.
Natasha.
Nat?
Nat.
Nat.
Nat.
You gotta help me.
It' s my daughter.
These people, they took her.
I don' t know who they are but she' s gone.
Jesus, she' s only fifteen!
Ma' am, you gotta take it easy.
They just took her.
You' ve gotta do something now!
I can' t help you I if I can' t understand what you' re saying.
Now, what does your daughter look like?
She' s tall and skinny with medium brown hair to here.
I' ve got a picture.
Here.
What was she wearing?
Denim jacket and blue jeans.
Please get out there and do something.
Bear with me.
I need to ask these questions in order to be able to help you.
What' s her full name?
Natasha Wilson.
Was she upset in any way?
Has she done this kind of thing before?
No, no.
Took her, okay?
It was a backpacker and a couple in an RV.
Okay, Mrs. Wilson, you stay put, so we know where to find you.
A local unit will be coming shortly to get your full statement.
What if they leave the freeway?
Ehicle out there does one hundred and fifty miles per ho
They won' t get away.
Are you familiar with the words of Jesus Christ?
Are you familiar with the words "fuck off"?
Shit!
Nat?
Nat?
I don' t like talking about my past life...... because it hurts me.
Really, do we have to talk about this?
And your father?
I don' t even know who my dad was.
Not that my mother even knew his last name.
And my mother died...
My parents... they were nice.
I mean, really fucking boring, okay.
And my brother, we were close.
We got along but we seemed, like, totally different, I mean...... he' s a mechanic, and he' s gonna be that his whole life.
Touch it and I' il rip your fucking neck off.
Put your foot down, bitch!
What have you done with my daughter?
Shut the fuck up and put your fucking foot down.
Forty- five three four seven, civilian call on nine 0 two.
Possible crashed or abandoned vehicle by the side of the freeway...... approximately three miles east of junction thirty- seven.
Described as a dark SUV or similar.
Vehicle remains upright, unknown if persons inside.
Relax.
You get any stiffer, rigor mortis will set in.
Come on, Nat, relax.
I know how you feel.
I had to go through it myself.
You see, Nat, there' s this whole community of people...... just like us.
You know, it' s like an extended family.
Only better.
It seems like ever since I met The Father...... my old life feels like it belongs to someone else.
He makes us feel special, like...... we finally fit in or belong to something bigger than ourselves.
He' s the reason we' re all here together.
How do you feel?
I feel...... different.
Do you wanna look different?
Yeah.
Then come on.
You all right?
I just ran my car off the road.
Really?
There are a lot of maniacs out here.
You' re alive...... that' s the main thing.
Look, could you just...... please get my car on the road?
Why don' t you come with me?
It' s not safe out on the freeway.
Should see to that cut.
Who is this?
That' s my sister.
What' s her name?
Christine.
She' s dead.
Do you wanna use my phone?
Call your husband?
No.
Maybe he' s worried about you.
I said no.
I' m gonna make the next stop.
And there you can report your accident to the police.
They can help you find your daughter.
It' s the Bradford district.
Right.
Thanks a lot.
Right.
There' s no record of a reported abduction.
In fact, there' s nothing matching your daughter' s description.
Of course not, she' s not a real police officer.
Do you have a photograph of your daughter?
No, that woman took it.
But I saw a picture of another girl in the pick- up truck...... and then I saw a cassette of the very same girl...
What has this got to d with your daughter?
If you stop and think about it for a minute... you' d see that they' re all in it together.
The recovery man, the backpacker, the couple with the RV!
We have no record of an officer responding.
No radio broadcasting, no...
Why aren' t you calling the FBI right now and reporting my daughter missing?
These people are deranged!
Is that what they are?
Deranged?
That' s her father.
My ex- husband.
That' s his cell phone.
Sorry to trouble you.
Detective Stephens here, from Bradford Police Division.
Senga Wilson, she says she' s your ex- wife.
Look, Detective, before you go any further...... there' s something you need to know about my ex- wife.
This isn' t exactly the first time I' ve gotten a call like this from the police.
Especially at this hour.
She' s been on medication since the divorce.
She' s delusional.
I understand you have a fifteen year old daughter, Natasha, is that correct?
Yes, my daughter' s here with me now.
She' s been with me all weekend.
I' m afraid Senga' s wasting everyone' s time.
I' m sorry I can' t be of more help, Detective.
Thank you for your time, Mr. Wilson.
Your husband has just told me that your daughter is safe at home with him.
Mrs. Wilson?
You do realize that?
Now, look...... if you' re in a domestic situation...... that' s okay.
Talk to one of our female officers.
God damn it.
Come on.
Hi, you' ve reached Lois and Marek.
Bastard.
It' s natural to be afraid of failure.
I remember what you remember.
I remember what you remember.
From creating the opportunities for success in the boardroom...... on the playing fields and in the bedroom.
We are bombarded with answers, but are we asking the right questions?
Now...... I want you to...... do something for me.
Close your eyes.
Go on.
Just for a minute.
Face the truth.
She' s gone.
She' s with me now.
I know your secrets.
I remember what you remember.
Senga.
What have you done with my daughter?
Where is she?
What have you done with her?
Tell me where she is?
Ma' am, you have to leave the restaurant right now.
I know what you' re doing.
Before I met The Father...... the only thing that ever gave me a rush was joyriding.
He' s got this amazing power to...... work out all the fucked up shit in your life.
Yeah...... don' t get me wrong, I still got a soft spot for jacking cars.
He' s gonna love you.
He' s ready.
Wait, wait, I don' t know, I mean, what' s gonna happen?
Nothing, unless you want it to.
Wait, no.
I feel weird.
No, weird' s good.
You' re gonna be fine.
Just have fun, you know.
Come on.
It' s okay.
Come on.
Ever soared up to the sun.
I read that.
Cast off those chains.
You know...... love' s the warmest place to be in when it' s cold outside.
I wore that.
What the fuck?
Get out of the car now!
Come with me now!
There' s no time...
What the hell are you doing here?
Listen to me, you have to go now.
Let me go!
Hurry up.
Mom.
Nat, run.
Nat, leave now, please.
This time kill her.
It' s all right, Nat.
You don' t have to go with her.
You don' t have to do anything you don' t want to.
You' re free now.
Nat, where are you?
Say something.
Nobody' s gonna hurt you, Nat.
Having your own life...... your own dreams...
She just wants to take you away from the ones who understand you.
Don' t listen to him, Nat.
You always knew she was crazy, didn' t you?
Unhinged. illogical.
A fantastic... liar.
We wanna give you a real family.
With no lies... no pills...... no restrictions...... no screaming matches...... just... love.
That' s bullshit, Nat.
I' m here.
I can see you.
They wanna kill you!
Funny you should mention that.
Isn' t that exactly what you tried to do?
She tried to kill you.
Did you know that?
Before you were even born.
She wanted an abortion, Nat.
Tried to flush you away.
Sorry.
I' m sorry.
I remember what you remember.
You gotta hang on.
Because the truth is with us in the house tonight.
Close your eyes.
See that door.
Hold that key.
You don' t have to fight any more.
It' s over.
Come on.
Come into the light.
Nat...... "m sorry you had to see it.
But I had to show you through the hypocrisy and the lies.
Pain is all in the past, not in the future.
All you have to do is meet me halfway.
Where' s my daughter?
I want my daughter back.
Listen.
You' ve got to trust me.
Nat was the only way I could find them.
There' s something you should see first.
They kill people by knocking them off the road.
Your husband didn' t even get five miles past the rest stop.
Come on, Nat, don' t lose your faith.
Join us.
What did you do with her?
You just don' t get it, do you?
This man is not who he says he is.
Don' t listen to them.
They' re full of lies.
I' m calling Marek.
He killed your father.
Wait, Nat.
Hey, Senga.
See you on the other side.
You stole my sister.
She was my sister too.
Hey, Senga...... "m only here to fill the void.
The void you created...... by not listening to who Nat really is.
Get him out of your head.
This is how he works.
He' s got them so fucked up they' re killing people for blood.
I was too late for Christine.
I had to kill her to stop her from killing anybody else.
You' re lucky you' re alive.
Why can' t you just leave me alone?
I' m your mother.
I don' t always get things right.
But please, Nat, you have to trust me now.
Let' s get out of here.
Let' s go.
Now!
Come on, Nat.
Wait.
You killed Christine...... now I' m gonna kill you.
She was already dead when I found her.
Not dead... free.
The day you tried to murder your daughter is the day you let me in.
Truth is in the house tonight...... Senga.
Fuck you.
Marvin, you gotta come see this shit.
- Did you get my pictures?
You gotta come outside.
Me and Des found something.
- What is it?
- You' il see.
Mom' s home.
She won' t want me to leave.
We can sneak past.
"Citizen' s Arrest" is on.
You gotta.
What is it you want me to see?
I think we found a dead body.
Going out, mom.
Back in a few.
Stay close.
Oh, shit, it' s too dark to see now, but the body' s down there.
I don' t see anything.
It' s at the bottom.
No.
It' s been, like, two hours.
Jesus.
Do you think it' s real?
When did you guys find it?
Find what?
The body in the sewer.
I don' t know.
We were pretty messed up.
Get doubles of these.
I want to send one to the cops.
I wouldn' t have shown you.
Did you finish my biology homework?
Look underneath.
What do you see?
Garbageman.
He' s new.
Garbageman.
The dark guy with the trash bags?
He moved in last week above Birdman.
What are you looking at now?
Ma Bell.
Still yammering at the grandkids?
Looks it.
Did I tell you I met your veiled lady?
What' s her name?
Carmen.
She' s a dentist' s assistant.
Is she nice?
Is she nice?
Sure.
I' il bring her around sometime.
You might like her.
Rosy...
Unless you' re allergic to that, too.
Shut up.
Well, don' t be so hypersensitive.
Oh, that gets funnier each night.
Oh, my God.
World' s Number- One Dad just lost his shit.
And look.
I found that downstairs.
Is that Number- One Son?
And I took this two days ago.
You see the shadow?
It moved.
Oh, my God.
That shadow moved?
Well, call the National Guard.
Call the Space Marines.
Call the cops.
They love this great fake- detective routine.
You' re scaring yourself because you' re bored.
I' m only looking.
That picture is so blurry, it could be Bigfoot.
Hey, Rose.
Hey, Des.
Huh?
You got any matches?
What' s up?
- Dinnertime!
long enough to eat.
Oh, God.
What the neighbors must think.
Hey, why do you leave the lights on?
So they can see you?
Hey, Ma...
I seen Rosy with this guy, and, um... and I think he' s a drug dealer.
Rosy' s a big girl.
Yeah, but don' t you think lately she' s been acting kinda off?
You didn' t like the lunch I made you.
I took the pills.
You can' t live on pills alone.
You' re so fragile.
You can' t afford to skip a meal.
Yeah, I wasn' t hungry.
I don' t want to be made to worry about you like this.
Well, I been thinking again about finding my own place.
You know that' s not possible.
Dr. Carson seems to think it' s a good idea.
He sees you once a month.
He doesn' t know how you are.
I' m 24 years old, Ma.
I' il take care of things.
Will you finish your dinner tonight?
I can' t stay here forever.
I love you.
Carmen.
Hi.
Uh, Carmen, this is my brother.
Marvin obviously knows who you are.
Oh, my God.
You weren' t kidding.
It' s kinda pervy.
You got a good eye.
I got good subjects.
What he' s got is a compulsion.
How long have you been doing this?
10 years, I guess.
Yeah, since he got sick.
I was one of the last kids to get Stricklers'.
You were one of those roach kids?
Well, I prefer "Bubble Boy."
Oh.
Right on.
- Judas Breed.
- Right.
You ever see any of them?
It didn' t work like that.
Sure he did.
All the time.
Shut up, Rosy.
He was on the phone to the CDC every week.
He thought he was Smokey the Bear of giant roaches.
I was 8 years old.
Yeah, try 16.
'cause they created the Judas for kids like him.
Kill the roaches that are making them sick.
You didn' t tell me I was on here!
- Yeah, um...
Did you want them back?
I mean, do you want them?
I mean, why would I want pictures of myself?
Can I have this one, though?
Yeah, sure.
- May I look?
- Yeah, just a sec.
What do you see?
Des is dealing Ma Bell dope.
What' s a "Des"?
Desmond, her boyfriend.
He' s not my boyfriend.
You okay?
And Ma Bell.
She' s always talking to her grandkids, so we call her that.
- Mrs. Leibowitz?
You know her?
I hear her at night.
She' s a phone- sex operator.
Are you okay?
Um... you smoke.
What?
It' s an allergy thing.
I put it out before I came inside.
He' s hypersensitive.
Well, should I go?
I mean, I' m sorry, you know?
- Sorry.
- I' m sorry.
- I didn' t think.
- It' s all right.
Yeah, take it easy.
I think she likes you.
Ma Bell' s running from something.
No kidding.
Garbageman' s down there.
Can you get me more film?
I' m busy.
Holy shit!
What?
He' s hurt.
I think there' s blood.
Where is he?
- Where?
- He' s right there.
Shit!
Jesus, what happened?
I don' t know.
Well, what did you see?
Hmm?
Mom!
Huh?
We have to call the cops.
- Hi.
- Detective Dumars.
Well, thanks for coming.
No problem.
Simone.
Do I know you?
Yeah.
What seems to be the problem?
Well... my kids think they saw something.
- Killed.
Oh, um, my son is a Stricklers' disease survivor.
He' s environmentally hypersensitive.
Must be very hard on you.
Yeah, it happened over there, near the entrance of the alley.
Mm- hmm.
He was covered in blood, and then he disappeared.
He was hurt?
Yeah.
Was, uh... anybody else around?
He saw the Garbageman.
I think I did.
Okay.
Okay, I bite.
Who' s the Garbageman?
Him.
You took these pictures?
- It' s his hobby.
- Yeah.
Oh...
He' s harmless.
This guy was at the scene when... what' s his name?
- Desmond.
- When Desmond disappeared?
Yeah, and there was blood.
The rain washed it away.
Get any pictures of that?
No, I was out of film.
Yeah, well...
Gee, I wonder what Desmond does for a living.
Well, I, um... might as well go have a chat with the Garbageman.
I don' t see him.
The guy' s harmless.
Well, who is he?
He didn' t see anything happen.
- Did you get his name?
- Never mind his name.
What about the garbage bags?
Why does he come out at night?
Maybe he collects food for the shelters.
What do you mean, maybe?
Did you talk to him?
Marvin.
Oh, I brought two glasses.
No, my shift ends in 20 minutes.
Is there a Mr. Montrose I should be getting a statement from?
- Yeah.
- No.
Cancer.
I' m so sorry to hear that.
What about Desmond?
Your friend, right?
Listen, I don' t know what to do, considering.
Considering what?
Marvin' s past.
The precinct.
I took your statement the last time Marvin witnessed a crime.
Oh, right.
I' m surprised you remembered.
That must be three years ago.
You didn' t even talk...
Easy, Marvin.
Maybe you need to spend a little less time peeping.
Okay, look, we both saw Desmond get killed.
Rosy!
Please.
She seems certain.
Are you?
And what about you?
What did you see?
It looked like something happened.
It looked like something happened?
Are you 100% sure, Marvin?
You saw a murder?
I don' t know.
I can check in on you from time to time.
Detective?
Yeah.
Sure.
I can put some of my guys on patrol.
Keep an eye on the 'hood.
And... call me Gary.
No, no, no, it' s not a problem.
No?
No, are you kidding?
- Oh, stop.
Rosy, hey.
Hey, fink.
You okay?
I saw you outside.
I' m fine.
Is this the thing about Rosy' s dealer?
He' s not my dealer.
Rosy was telling me about this garbage guy.
I' ve seen him around.
What' s he look like?
His face?
It' s a face.
I never really noticed.
Are those the cops Dumars put downstairs?
Yeah.
Is he still on the couch with mom?
Yep.
Are you okay?
I haven' t smoked in two days.
You' re a good influence on me.
What the hell is he doing?
Who?
Garbageman.
There' s something glowing in his apartment.
Weird.
You' re wearing perfume.
Yeah.
Oh, God!
I didn' t even think!
- It' s okay.
- I' m so sorry.
He might be allergic to you.
- Shut up, Rosy.
- I' m gonna go.
- I' m coming.
- I' m sorry.
- I' m sorry.
- Okay, I' m sorry.
Come in.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You' re alone.
Yeah, Rosy' s arguing with your mom and Dumars.
- Guess what.
I' ve given up everything.
No cigarettes.
No perfume.
I' m clean, harmless.
You could eat off me.
God, what a corncob.
What' s Dumars doing now?
Trying to pork mom, accusing me of being a junkie.
I want to smash him.
How' s Garbage?
He doesn' t leave his apartment anymore.
Just watches.
Sounds familiar.
Des has been gone long enough to be a missing person.
Did you ask Officer Dumars?
Whatever.
He' s got other things on his mind.
Hey, can I look?
Sure.
Are you okay?
Are you taking anything?
I haven' t had anything since Des has been gone.
It' s part of the problem.
There' s Mrs. Leibowitz.
Ma Bell?
Yeah, she' s been down there for a while.
I think she' s looking for Desmond.
Like Rosy?
Lost a fix.
Fuck off, Carmen.
Rosy...
I' m sorry.
It' s just...
I don' t know what we saw, but it looked bad.
And Garbageman...
I gotta do something.
You know, my dad' s the building manager.
Bad idea.
What idea?
It would be the easiest thing to get a key to Garbageman' s apartment.
Terrible, terrible idea.
And Marvin could keep watch for us.
Here' s my mobile number.
Haven' t you guys seen this movie?
Fucking terrible idea.
What do you think?
The Pastures.
Adam Pasture.
The kid who disappeared last week.
His family would have reported him missing.
We could talk to them.
See what they know.
And it might help get Dumars to take us serious- ly.
Come on, it' s not gonna hurt.
This should be the Pastures.
Yeah?
It' s Carmen.
There' s no answer.
I can' t see through the curtains.
Um...
I can' t tell.
His apartment' s dark.
Maybe he' s gone.
I don' t know.
He' s been hanging out in the dark lately.
Jesus.
What?
Garbageman.
He' s in Birdman' s apartment.
You sure?
He' s just standing there.
Then he' s not home.
Carmen?
Carmen?
Marvin, we' re inside.
Carmen, there' s two of them.
God, it smells like shit in here.
Two of who?
- Two Garbagemen.
Maybe neither of them are him.
You need to get out of there.
Rosy found feathers.
They' re gray, like pigeons or something.
I don' t think it' s him.
Oh, I just figured out what was glowing.
It' s his fridge.
It' s padlocked.
Carmen, get Rosy.
She' s trying to find a light switch.
Carmen, can you hear me?
Yes, dear, I can hear you.
I know you think this is a bad idea, but...
- Rosy, no!
Carmen, get out!
Fuck.
Mom!
Mom!
Rosy' s in trouble!
10 minutes!
Mom!
It' s serious!
God damn it!
You are way too old for this!
Just go over there!
I just don' t understand.
Rosy was in Garbageman' s apartment, and then he took her!
What do you mean?
Haven' t we bugged this guy enough?
Rosy could be dead right now!
- I' m calling the cops.
I mean the real cops.
Rosy.
She says she lives here.
Yeah, we' re her parents.
I' d appreciate it if you kept an eye on her.
Are you okay?
What happened, exactly?
She was in my apartment.
I don' t think she stole anything.
What were you doing in there?
Are you stealing?
Is this about drugs?
- No.
- This won' t happen again.
You are not leaving till you are cleaned up.
Who do you think you are?
Now, you are grounded.
Get in your room.
- Fuck off.
Rosy.
- I' m sorry.
- I' il file a report if you want.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We won' t bother you again.
I appreciate that.
- Good night.
- Night.
Why didn' t he recognize you?
I thought you had a talk with him.
Why do you insist on doing this to your mother?
You' re too old to ground.
He couldn' t go anywhere anyway.
Okay.
I' il see you in a second.
Thanks.
How you doing?
Good.
Oh.
You think you' il stay long?
I don' t know.
Do you think Dumars has any terminal diseases?
Yeah, okay, babe.
I' il talk to you soon.
Yeah.
Bye.
Marvin.
You' re in my room.
Well, that was your mom.
She' s, uh...
Whoops.
- Leave it.
I said, "Leave it"!
So, Marvin...
I want us...
I want us to be friends.
So what exactly is your beef?
I just don' t know what you' re doing.
She' s a special lady.
And she really digs me.
And I think that what we' ve got could really blossom.
I don' t want to know what you do with my mom, just so long as you never pretend to be my dad.
And stop pretending that you don' t believe me and assigning these guys to the courtyard.
What?
Who' s the official- looking guy in the car?
Let me see.
And there' s another one.
And another one.
Those aren' t my guys.
I might as well be a beat cop.
I don' t even have "guys."
I' m sorry.
I was trying to impress your mom.
I don' t even have the authority to put men on patrol.
Well, then who are they?
Well... maybe I could find out.
Hey, you' re home.
What are you doing out here?
Oh, trying not to smoke.
Because of Marvin?
That' s so sweet.
Shit, it' s Garbageman.
What the hell is this?
This was supposed to happen tomorrow.
I' m out of time.
It' s now or never.
Is it stable?
If you keep it cold.
I don' t like it.
- Watch it!
I' m very, very sorry.
It was a mistake.
- A little mistake.
I' m very sorry.
Excuse me, sir?
Sir?
Just a moment.
The phone.
Where' s the fucking phone?
- Marvin?
- Where are you?
Following Garbageman.
We need help.
Close it.
Now.
The customer you are trying to reach is out...
Oh, my God.
Well... fuck.
What' s going on?
You' re about to get what you paid for.
- Fuck!
- No!
Let me help.
She won' t stop bleeding.
Good.
The blood draws them.
No!
No!
Let her out!
You' re gonna help me.
- Come on, come on.
Come on.
911 emergency.
I' ve seen two of them.
Could you repeat that, sir?
Two people are dead.
My sister' s been... killed.
Come on.
Go.
Give me the goddamn phone.
- The Judas egg.
- Smart boy.
That' s a king egg.
I have an emergency.
Forward this to the CDC, A. D. Kirschner.
Immediately.
Authorization 197667.
We' ve got two specimens.
They' re soldier caste.
What' s the matter?
I' m allergic to roaches.
Right.
Then you' il be my coal miner' s canary.
Put that in the fridge.
Nobody does anything stupid, and nobody has to die early.
We have to destroy it.
Now, that qualifies as stupid.
A fertile male could establish a new colony.
Deck chairs on the "Titanic."
That egg is one of thousands.
They' re hoarding them.
Waiting.
We have to try to...
Hey, I will kill you.
So help me God, I' il kill you.
That egg equals my getaway money.
As far from civilization as I can get.
We' ve already lost.
It' s over.
- Empty that around the door.
- It' s kerosene.
They don' t like fire.
They don' t have intelligence.
Strategize, reason.
That' s how we made them.
They don' t have to be any bigger or stronger, so they got smarter.
This is not a city anymore.
It' s a goddamn killing jar.
The door!
- Mom.
- Yeah?
Why aren' t you in your room?
Run!
Close the goddamn door!
Oh, my God.
It' s us.
Is Carmen alive?
He' s trying to talk.
Peter, are you okay?
You' re up early today.
Hi.
Hi, Emma.
It' s good to see you again.
Do you remember me?
It' s Yoko.
- Sorry.
Did I wake you?
- Bottom drawer.
Thank you.
- You know me so well.
- Come back to bed.
I can' t.
I' m gonna be late for my architecture midterm.
Check your watch.
I set the clock an hour ahead last night.
Maybe you know me too well.
I' m really glad you decided to come here with me.
- Me, too.
- You sure?
Why?
- It' s a big deal, you know.
- Lots of people go abroad.
Besides, you' ve been dreaming about coming here forever.
I' m just glad we could be together.
- Nope.
Just have to pick up a book I left at the Care Center.
Come on, you could spare 10 minutes.
I promise I' il get you to class on time.
- Where are you going?
- Come here.
I wanna show you something.
It' s a Buddhist ritual.
The incense smoke carries the prayers to the spirits of their ancestors.
It' s to help them find peace.
They must have lost someone they loved.
Excuse me.
Come on.
- Karen?
- Yes, Alex?
- Are you free this afternoon?
- Just a test to study for.
Why?
Your wish has been granted.
Your first visit alone.
Just make sure she has what she needs, and help out around the house.
It' s Yoko' s case, but she didn' t show up for work this morning.
I can' t get her on the phone.
She must be sick or something.
And she has the damn house key.
What' s this phrase?
That' s "severe lethargy with mild dementia."
Apparently, she sleeps through most of the day.
Her daughter- in- law doesn' t work, so she' il probably be there.
It' s an English- language house, so you should be fine.
Here' s the address.
You can use the wall chart if you need help... and don' t forget to bring a map, okay?
Don' t worry, Karen.
You' re ready.
Hello?
Is anybody here?
Oh, my God.
Are you all right?
Come here.
Okay, Emma.
My name' s Karen Davis.
I' m from the Care Center.
I' m substituting for Yoko, just for today.
Hello?
Yes, he was shut in the closet.
There was tape all around the door.
They' re not home yet.
I don' t know.
Emma still hasn' t said a word to me.
No, he won' t come down.
I know.
I' m sorry, Alex.
Okay.
Just get here as soon as you can.
Toshio.
Matthew and Jennifer aren' t around.
Leave a message.
Hey, guys, it' s Susan.
Matt, are you there?
Pick up.
Okay, I' m leaving work now, so you can try my cell... or give me a call at home later.
I just want to make sure Mom' s okay.
So just call me when you can, okay?
Who are you talking to?
I just want her to leave me alone.
You need to get some rest, okay?
Welcome.
What do you think?
Your shoes.
- Even in your own house.
It' s perfect for Mom.
She won' t even have to deal with the stairs.
- Hey, where' s Mom?
- I' il look for her.
Where are you?
Come on, Mom.
You know what the doctor said about stairs.
- Yeah.
Hey, Mom.
What?
Mom, are you all right?
- We' il take it.
- Okay.
Morning.
I hope Mom' s okay.
She' s been sleeping ever since we got here.
Not at night.
I' ve told you, Matthew, you can sleep through anything.
I' m sorry, sweetheart.
I' m sure it was just the move.
She' il get back on schedule.
- Have you seen my travel mug?
- I haven' t unpacked it yet.
Maybe you should say something to the helper.
- What' s her name?
- Yoko.
Who knows?
Maybe she can suggest something.
Maybe.
I miss seeing this.
I guess now we' re gonna have to talk in the morning.
Hey, kiddo, you okay?
Jen?
Sorry, honey, are you all right?
What' s up?
I went for a walk yesterday.
Just to explore.
And I got so lost.
This will get easier soon.
I promise.
Or else?
Or else I tell the company it' s just not working out.
And we' re going back to the States with or without my old job.
They can find somebody else to crunch their numbers.
But until then... promise me you' il give it a good try, okay, Jen?
Deal.
If you want something, all you have to do is say so.
Who' s there?
What the hell...
Are you all right?
Mom, where' s Jennifer?
Come on.
You scared...
Honey?
What is it?
What' s wrong?
What happened?
Honey, what is it?
I' m gonna call an ambulance, all right?
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
This is Det.
Is Karen okay?
She is very shaken.
We would like her to stay in the hospital tonight under evaluation.
Do you know these people?
Yeah, that' s Matthew Williams and his wife, Jennifer.
He' s the son of the woman Karen came here to see.
When was the last time you saw them?
When they came in to register.
It' s standard procedure... although the visits were arranged by his employer.
- I think he works at...
- We' ve spoken with his employer.
He hasn' t shown up for work today.
If you could please come by tomorrow and make a statement.
The address is there at the bottom.
- Yoko.
- I' m sorry?
Karen' s a substitute.
Yoko' s the girl who' s normally in charge of Emma.
She' s also been missing from work.
For how long?
Since yesterday.
I think I saw her bike outside.
Hey, guys, it' s Susan.
Matt, are you there?
Pick up.
Okay, I' m leaving work now, so you can try my cell... or give me a call at home later.
I' m just a little worried about Mom.
I just want to make sure she' s okay.
So just call me when you can, okay?
Thursday, 8: 27 p. m.
End of messages.
It' s okay.
I' ve got you.
Your boss told me what happened.
I' m sorry.
I' m not even sure what did happen.
An old woman passed away in her sleep.
- It' s sad, but that' s all it is.
- Is that how they' re saying she died?
That house.
There was something...
It' s okay, Karen.
Matthew and Jennifer aren' t around.
Leave a message.
Hey, guys, it' s Susan.
Matt, are you there?
Pick up.
Okay, I' m leaving work now, so you can try my cell... or give me a call at home later.
I' m just a little worried about Mom.
I just want to make sure she' s okay.
So just call me when you can, okay?
Matthew, stop it.
Is anyone there?
Excuse me!
There was something on the...
- Sit down, please.
- Please, just help.
Hello?
It' s me.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I' m downstairs.
What number are you again?
1601.
I' il buzz you in.
I don' t know what you' re up...
How are you feeling?
Tired.
- You are an exchange student?
- Yes.
And you have been volunteering at the Care Center for...
Three months.
I needed a social welfare credit.
You said this was the first time you' d been in that house?
Yeah.
About the Japanese boy you said you saw there...
- Did you find him?
- No, not yet.
You said the boy had been taped into the closet?
That' s right.
And there was a book, a journal.
Did it belong to the boy?
I don' t think so.
I think it belonged to a woman.
The writing looked feminine.
Did you speak with the boy after you opened the closet?
Briefly.
I asked his name.
He said it was Toshio.
One more question, please.
We found this in the hallway.
This is him.
This is the boy.
Detective Nakagawa?
I felt something was wrong.
What happened there?
The bodies of the son and daughter- in- law... of the woman you were caring for were found in the attic.
It seems that the son killed his wife, and then himself.
Please excuse me for a moment.
What are you doing here?
I thought they weren' t gonna let you go until tonight.
Did you escape?
I just had to get out of there.
I didn' t wanna be alone.
Okay, Karen.
Hold on a second.
What' s wrong?
Talk to me.
I think I saw something in that house.
Emma and I were alone in that room... but I think there was something else there with us.
Karen, what is it?
I just wanna go home.
Hello?
What happened, Yoko?
My name is Karen Davis.
I' m really sorry to bother you.
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
Questions about what?
I realize this is really awkward.
I need to ask you a few questions about your husband.
This is all his stuff from school.
This is from our first date.
My God.
Peter!
Hey, Shimizu.
- Happy Monday.
- Yeah, right.
Here' s your mail.
- Another one?
- Yeah.
I have no idea.
She says she used to be in one of my classes... but I don' t know who the hell she is.
- Thanks.
- No problem.
- Have a good one.
- Thanks.
Hi.
Detective Nakagawa, I need to speak with you.
The woman who was murdered in that house three years ago knew this man.
He committed suicide the morning after she died.
I don' t believe he killed himself.
I don' t understand.
What' s happening?
Three years ago... three of my colleagues, my friends... began investigating a case.
Two died mysteriously, and one disappeared.
They had been investigating the murders at that house.
Are you saying the detectives died because of that house?
So have you!
It is said in Japan... that when a person dies in extreme sorrow or rage... the emotion remains... becoming a stain upon that place.
The memory of what happened repeats itself there.
Death becomes a part of that place... killing everything it touches.
Once you have become a part of it... it will never let you go.
I' m sorry.
Karen, it' s me.
Look, where have you been all day?
I' m really worried about you.
The Care Center called.
Alex and Yoko are dead.
I found your research and...
Did you go to that house?
I' m coming to find you.
- Did you get my message?
- Doug!
Don' t worry...
It isn' t any problem.
I' il call you before I leave.
Ten minutes.
Yeah, I' il be home soon.
Yeah, love you, too.
Guess your mom' s gonna be late.
You' re sweating.
I know, I' m excited though, I can see it all happening,
Now side to side.
Other people can sing.
Can we talk out here for a minute?
She' s fantastic.
What are you talking about?
I think she sings funny.
That' s the first time she did it, okay?
Yeah, but I had all the kits by then.
Because she didn' t take the kettle, so I was stuck.
Do you want me to take the kettle, Samuel?
No, I don' t, I just want Kathy to put it over here, This is, you know...
If you say these words, and then, boom, you just put your hands out, and there they are, They' re there.
Please don' t drop the props, Kathy,
Wait, wait.
Why are you putting it on her head, though?
I' m a little confused.
I don' t know, It was, uh...
Because she' s not going to pick it up.
It looks like you' re trying to... put a hat on her head or something.
You' re fantastic.
You just have to listen to your heart, Cvalda,
I don' t want you to call me Cvalda,
Okay, Paul, please,
You' re Cvalda to me,
Let' s do some sound effects,
Wait!
I told you no tapping in "The Sound of Music,"
Like drums or something,
Everybody' s doing a great job,
Oh, hello, Selma, Come here,
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, I' m ready,
Yeah,
So let' s try this one,
"F- E- Z- T,"
Maybe even this one,
"T- E- F- P- O..."
I think you can work that machine safely,
I' il write a note to the plant and let them know,
Thank you,
Bye,
Goodbye,
Goodbye,
We lost five hours' cause some idiot broke the machine,
Bill' s here,
So?
Well, he' s here with Gene,
Oh, that sounds like bad news,
What are you going to do?
Well, I guess I got to tell her, don' t i?
You can' t bring the script to work, Selma,
Keep your eyes on the machine, okay?
Yeah,
Sure,
Bill' s here,
Bill?
He' s here with Gene,
Not again!
You got to come right back, okay?
Don' t be too worried,
We' re gonna work this out,
Here she comes,
Why are you not in school?!
When I say so, you go to school!
Do you think I joke?
You have to study!
Come on, Selma, stop,
We talked about this, Didn' t we talk about it?
Hanging out with those automobile thieves,
So what?
He' s learning,
Aw, come on,
Gene, this is the most important thing,
Selma, l -- I can... drive him back to school if you like,
Since when was that your business?
What you doing here?
If you need a ride home --
Sometimes you punch out around this time,
Don' t need a dumb...
Don' t need a ride!
All right,
Come on, Mr, G, Let' s get you to school,
I' il just...
Bye, Jeff,
She likes you,
I' m sure of it,
You' re sure?
Yeah, I' m sure of it,
This is my punishment, that you help me with this,
And you' ve got...
You' ve got to make your bed as well,
And you forgot to wrap up the bread,
Two times,
There' s no more of that,
You keep reading,
"So long, farewell, auf... wiedersehen... adieu, adieu, adieu, to yieu and yieu and yieu,"
"To yieu... and yieu..."
What does that mean,
"yieu"?
It' s your dumb musical,
"And yieu..."
It' s German,
- You think?
You want some more ketchup?
No.
Are you tired?
Why -- why should you... always ask me so... so stupid questions?
Shall I show you my step?
How' s the dancing?
Oh... good,
- Yeah?
- Yeah, Yeah,
You want to come over to me and Bill' s place and listen to some music?
That -- that would be lovely,
But... we couldn' t,
Come on, Come on,
Let' s go, Come on,
You should ask Bill about his money,
Linda likes it when we talk about that,
You' re doing a very nice job with these,
Uh- huh,
Otherwise I don' t get paid for it,
No,
You wouldn' t buy it if it was bent,
That' s true, I wouldn' t,
Wouldn' t buy anything if it was bent,
In Czechoslovakia,
I saw a film, and they were eating candy from a tin just like this,
No,
I thought to myself... how wonderful it must be in the United States,
You think my house looks like a movie?
Oh, our house looks like a movie,
And you look like a movie star,
You know?
Of course, it' s all that money you inherited, isn' t it, Bill?
That' s right,
Take the rest with you,
Are you sure?
Hello,
Good morning,
Oh,
You always pay right on time,
Don' t worry about Gene, I' il get him off to school, okay?
Thank you,
Remember your bag,
Bye- bye,
Bye,
I think you' re always so serious, Kathy,
Aw... again we start,
I don' t think inside you' re serious at all,
I don' t know,
Not always,
Cvalda,
Why do you call me that?
It' s like... someone who' s...
I don' t know, just big and happy,
Happy?
Just need someone to pull it out,
Beautiful eyes,
Yeah,
But he' s not real happy, is he?
How is she doing?
It' s when she cannot keep up, and she' s going to faint,
Ah, she fainted,
Please be quiet,
She doesn' t see that well,
I paid good money to see this film,
Well, so did she.
I love it when they dance.
We know that!
Oh, you' re so smart.
- Yes, - Oh,
I think you made friends, Kathy,
Stop!
So, what' d she say?
What?
What did she say?
She didn' t say anything,
Are you trying to tell me something?
It' s about the bike,
Mm, the bike,
Oh, um, l -- I --
I cannot give Gene a bike,
Is this his idea?
No, it' s not his idea,
Gene?
Did you ask them to come over?
No,
He doesn' t know anything, Selma, Frankly,
Why, have I done something?
No,
I haven' t got the money,
I' m almost the only kid in class who doesn' t have a bike,
I even know a boy who' s got a scooter,
You know I haven' t got any money,
The only extra money I got the times I managed to save up,
I send it... to Grandpa,
- Come have a look, - I' m not gonna get you expensive things,
Your mother is only teasing,
Look what she' s brought for you!
It' s a bike!
We cannot accept that,
Selma, it was second- hand,
I can' t give him any expensive things,
- Yeah, but, well -- - He' s just gonna accept that,
I' m not that sort of mom,
I' m just not that kind of mother, Gene, I...
Can' t you be that kind of a mother?
Hmm...
We' il see,
Careful!
Don' t ride too fast,
Hey, gene, bring it over here,
He looks very happy, doesn' t he?
He does look happy,
Attention!
Bring it over here,
Mom...
Okay,
Did you hear what she said?
Did you say okay?
Promise to go to school,
Yes, yes,
Every day, On time,
I didn' t know you were such a good biker,
Rust and women are the same,
"Rust and women are the same"?
They are the same,
Your fat Yeah, id that?
I don' t know what it meant,
You' re so kind, Look at me,
He did all the work, you know that,
Thank you, Jeff!
You' re welcome,
Come in,
Something up, Bill?
No, no, I just couldn' t sleep, that' s all,
I have no money,
It' s gone,
And Linda...
She spends and spends,
And my salary' s nowhere near enough,
I can' t say no to her,
The bank' s gonna repossess the house... because I' m so far behind on the payments,
And I' m gonna lose Linda,
I know it,
I know I am,
She loves you, Bill,
Oh, don' t cry,
I shouldn' t have told you,
Don' t worry,
- Shouldn' t have told you, - It' s okay,
No, I think you' ve got enough... stuff,
Would it make you feel better if I told you a secret?
What secret could you tell me?
I' m going blind,
Soon,
Maybe sometime this year,
Blind...
It' s not as bad as it sounds,
It' s a family thing,
But, blind?
I' ve always known it,
From... when I was a little girl,
And you' re okay?
You know?
Gene?
He doesn' t know about it,
You... you mustn' t tell him, because then it could get worse,
I just have to save up money, you know, enough money to...
Oh, I almost got it,
To, uh...
For the operation,
They can operate on Gene when he turns 1 3,
And you made up that story about your father?
I never had a father,
I made up his name, too,
And that' s why you put in all these hours and do all these pins and do everything you do,
For his operation,
I guess...
How is it your fault?
But I had him... all the same,
You' re very strong,
I' m not strong,
I' ve got little games I play when it goes really hard,
When I' m working in the factory... and the machines, they make these... rhythms...
And I just start dreaming, and it all becomes music,
But you like movies, don' t you?
- I love the movies, - Yeah?
I just love the musicals,
Oh, when they' re all tap dancing?
I... wouldn' t you like to be in that big, long line?
Kicking your feet up there?
Yeah,
When they' re, like, spiraling up the huge, enormous wedding cakes to the top?
Yeah,
But isn' t that annoying when they do the last song in the films, though?
Why?
I hate that,
I really hate that,
I used to cheat on that when I was a little girl back in Czechoslovakia,
I would leave the cinema just after the next to last song, and the film would just go on forever,
It' s lovely, isn' t it?
That is lovely,
Selma...
Yeah?
Thank you for telling me your secret,
Thanks for telling me yours,
Mum' s the word, right?
"Mum"?
We don' t tell anybody?
Oh, yes,
I won' t tell anyone,
Goodbye,
Oh, thank you,
So, can I get you another?
Yeah, sure,
How about a big one?
How many is there in a big one?
10, 000,
I' il have a big one,
What' s this guy' s name again?
Who?
The old man, your old man, the guy we' re carding these pins for,
Her father?
I know, Oldrich,
Yeah,
Oldrich Novy,
He used to dance in Prague,
You commies make a big deal out of sharing everything,
Yeah,
It' s -- It' s a good thing,
Czechoslovakia' s so much better than the U, S, of A?
No, Selma, no!
There are two plates,
It' s all right,
You know what happens when you put two plates in, don' t you?
Well, she didn' t do it, I mean, it didn' t happen --
You destroy the tool,
It takes a whole day to mend,
Never two plates, Selma, never!
You cheated the doctor,
I mean, how dare you!
Just how much can you see?
I could do my job with my eyes closed,
So could you,
It' s just because I was daydreaming,
Daydreaming?
Dreaming about what?
Oh, I just hear music,
Come on, I mean, Selma, music?
You could also cut off your hand just like that, You have to watch out every second,
Promise me you' il stay awake,
I -- I promise I will stop daydreaming,
Aw, you' re not -- you repeat, but you don' t even listen to me,
I don' t know why I bother that much,
Hi, Selma,
If you' re not going with Kathy, can I give you a lift?
I don' t want a boyfriend,
Yeah,
I just don' t have time for a boyfriend,
Not right now,
I know,
If I wanted a boyfriend, it would be you, Jeff,
All right,
No problem, you know, on the back, to have the bike there,
Bye, Jeff,
- Selma?
- Bye, jeff,
Are you okay?
Yeah, I' m fine,
Hello, Selm,
Hi, Bill,
Headed home?
Uh, yes,
Want to put it in the back?
Hi, Jeff,
Hey, Did you see the truck?
No?
They' re blind, driving like crazy,
He' s what?
Getting dirty,
That' s all right,
Thank you,
Bye,
Thank you, Bill,
If I could just make the next payment,
Yeah,
All I need is a loan,
This money is Gene' s,
I' m sorry, Bill,
That' s all right, I shouldn' t have asked,
Oh, you had to, Don' t worry, there' s no harm in asking,
No, no, I shouldn' t have asked,
Linda wants new couches,
I could always shoot myself,
You mustn' t say things like that,
It' s -- Make things easier,
- You know that, Bill, - Aw, Selma,
You mustn' t say things like that,
Selma, I' m kidding,
Hi, Selma, Come on in,
Hi, Gene,
Good morning,
How are you?
Fine, thank you,
Can I see the gun?
Yeah, go on, sure,
- He' s got a gun?
- Sure,
He' s a police officer,
I just didn' t know he would keep it here, in the house,
He keeps it in his desk,
Maybe I should pay more rent,
It' s been the same for the whole period I' ve been here,
No, Selma, I won' t hear it,
You keep your money, You need it more than we do,
Two boxes?
Did you decide you are going to do two boxes at the same time now?
Yeah,
Selma... 1 0: 00 then?
1 0: 00,
What happens at 1 0: 00?
I' m -- I' m gonna do the night shift,
You can hardly see well enough to do your own shift,
It suits me fine,
It' s just after drama class,
You are going to do that, too?
I' ve had my fill of you, Selma,
You do what you want,
Go ahead, break your neck,
Do your night shift, but don' t think for one second
Selma?
Kathy split already,
I' m not looking for Kathy,
I just have to go to drama rehearsal,
So what do you say?
You can always ride your bike,
I left it at home,
I thought it' d be quicker if I walked,
How do you reckon that?
I just walk along the railroad tracks,
It' s a... shortcut,
Look, I don' t understand, In musicals... why do they start to sing and dance all of a sudden?
No...
You' re right, Jeff, You don' t,
The last thing on the list is the bake sale,
Two sundays away,
Hi, Selma, Come on in, come on in,
I' m gonna introduce you to your understudy,
My understudy?
Yeah,
This girl Suzan, who boris knows, is a good singer, She' s a good dancer,
She' il learn your part, too, because, say, you get a cold, and... you can' t do it, then the show doesn' t have to stop,
Okay?
Suzan, Selma, Selma, Suzan,
Could you take off your glasses?
I think we' il do the part without glasses,
Next sunday, you will see both Marias,
All right?
It' s your first time on the night shift, right?
While this is being pressed, you' il be cutting on the other machine,
That means you' il be in charge of two machines,
You have to beat Sarah over there, right?
This pallet must never be empty,
Is it always so dark in here?
What?
Is it always so dark in here?
It' s exactly the same as the daytime,
The only thing is you have to work a little faster,
That' s what you' re paid for, right?
- Okay, - Okay?
Thank you,
- Excuse me, - Yeah?
Okay,
What are you doing here?
What do you think?
I didn' t put you down for the night shift, Kathy,
Run along, Norman,
I' m on my own time now,
How I spend it is my own business,
'Night, ladies!
Good night!
Faster,
A little faster,
I like it better when you dance,
Cvalda,
I will dance when there is music,
It' s music,
Now dance,
Selma!
Stop that, you' ve cut yourself!
Get away from the machine!
Henry!
Oh, Jeff is here,
Hello, Jeff,
Hi, Kathy,
Do you live here?
Thought she might say yes to a ride when it' s this late,
M- maybe Kathy... wants a ride,
No, it' s all right,
What' s that, with your hand?
She cut her...
Yeah, It' s going to be all right,
The plates are sharp,
Goodnight,
Careful,
I think I found a solution to our problem,
That makes me really happy,
It' s nothing special...
But I' ve made up my mind, I' m gonna tell Linda, and, uh...
I mean, after all, she loves me, and...
We' il just work it out together,
That sounds like a really good idea, Bill,
I' m sorry, I' il let you get to bed,
I guess I' m kinda tired,
Thanks, Bill,
Good night, Selma,
Good night, Bill,
Bill?
What' s happening now?
Here we go, Selma, are you ready?
And...
You' re on,
Cut, Cut, stop,
Stop, please,
This is Selma' s entrance, okay?
Okay, Paul, please,
How far do you think it is?
I don' t know,
And...
Kathy, what are you doing?
This is Maria' s entrance,
Yes, I' m sorry,
Please, please!
Six steps,
Let' s take this a little more seriously,
Good!
Okay, I' m thinking maybe, Selma...
You could take a little sort of circle around Boris on this next part, unless you have something else you wanna suggest,
Okay?
Samuel,
Yes?
I need to talk to you,
Oh, Selma, please, if it' s about the drummer,
I have been looking everywhere for a drummer --
It' s not about the drummer,
Um... just a quick word,
Okay,
I -- I' m not gonna play Maria,
What?
My heart just isn' t in this...
Like, I shouldn' t be wasting my time on something... that isn' t... that important really,
I' ve been watching Suzan, and she' s...
She' s very --
Terrific,
Suzan' s terrific, I' m not denying that, but you -- I thought you lived for musicals,
So you' ve been pretending the whole time?
Yes,
I' ve just been pretending,
I' ve got everything cast right now,
Yeah,
The only part that' s left is the old nun who lets maria out of the convent gate,
I don' t think you' d want that part,
She' s quite serious then?
It' s important for the part,
Okay, I' m not dancing really,
I could put a little bit of dancing in there,
You think so?
You can have your tapping,
She could be just a little... humorous once in a while... even though she' s a nun,
You' il always be my perfect Maria,
Where are all the hairpins today?
I left them at home,
And she won' t be playing Maria,
What do you reckon I' m gonna do if I can' t bawl you out for learning your lines on company time?
Three!
What kind of a joke is that?
Well, she' s beating me,
I need a word with you,
We' re talking right now,
Come on,
Please sit down,
We were off for the whole day,
Everything stops when the machine breaks,
I -- I can do my job just fine... if I stick to the day shift,
This won' t happen again,
Look, I daydream too much,
And...
And I guess, then l -- I forgot,
I' ve been ordered to let you go, Selma,
You' re not gonna have to pay for the machine you broke,
I got them to agree to that,
Uh, thanks, Norman,
This is your salary,
Maybe we can find you something away from the machines where your eyesight wouldn' t matter so much,
Not right away,
That' s very kind of you,
I' il be okay, I really will,
Thanks, Norman,
Thank you, Selma,
Thank you,
What is she going to do now?
Did you ever think about that?
Don' t worry, Kathy, Really,
I' m gonna be fine,
Has anybody seen Jeff today?
He' s usually here early, Selma, but not this early,
It' s a shame,
Selma!
I could give you a lift if you want,
Later,
I need to do something important at... at 3: 00,
Well, you need to get your truck then, don' t you?
Yeah,
Train' s coming, Get off the track, Jeff,
You have to be careful,
Stay to the side,
You can' t see, can you?
What is there to see?
You can' t see, can you?
See you at 3: 00,
I can see,
Gene hasn' t come back yet,
I need to talk to Bill,
He decided to take the day off to go to the bank for his box,
Yeah,
I know everything, Selma,
Bill told me,
I want you to move out!
I -- I don' t understand,
Wh- what would you know?
That you asked him into the trailer, but he turned you down!
You' ve got nothing to say for yourself?
No,
I want to talk to Bill,
Hi, Bill,
Linda saw me go up to the, um...
Up to the trailer,
I told her it was you who wanted to, uh...
That you' d...
That you' d fallen in love with me,
I know, She told me,
And what did you tell her?
Nothing,
You didn' t tell her I was lying?
Mum' s the word, right?
Linda told me you went to the bank,
I went to the bank to ask for more time,
But I couldn' t do it,
And I brought the box home instead,
Linda always gets so proud when she sees me sitting in here with it,
But you have put my money in it, haven' t you?
I tried to shoot myself, but...
But it' s my money, Bill,
I' m gonna have to take it,
Well, you can have it back,
No, you can have it,
Bill...
Selma,
I can' t save up more money,
That' s over now,
Gene doesn' t even turn 1 3 until after christmas,
It was $2, 026 and 1 0 cents in the tin,
I can' t count it now, but I trust you,
And it' s... $30 I got today... which makes it 2, 056... and 1 0 cents,
It' s not enough,
But it' il have to do,
- Bye, Bill, - Selma...
Selma, stop,
I' m pointing my gun at you, Selma,
I don' t believe you,
You' re just trying to scare me,
I can' t see a gun,
Just... feel this, Feel this,
Just feel it!
Do you believe I have the gun?
I believe you,
But it' s my money,
No, it' s my money,
It' s the money I had in my box,
And you' re trying to steal it from me,
Selma!
Selma, stop!
Selma, stop!
Linda!
Linda!
What' s the matter, Bill?
She tried to steal the money,
She knew I had the gun in my... in my drawer and she --
Is that why you wanted him, for the money?
Go out to the car and get my handcuffs,
Go get the handcuffs,
Give me the money,
Give me the money and i' il let you go,
Where should I go?
Just give me the money,
Selma,
The money,
No!
Bill!
You shot me,
No, no, Selma,
You did the right thing,
I should' ve done it myself,
Kill me,
Just kill me,
Will you just be my friend... and show some mercy, please, and just... kill me?
Your handcuffs aren' t in the car, Bill,
Just show some mercy, Selma, and just...
Linda, run,
Run!
Get up there!
Go on to Miller' s farm!
If you want the money...
you' re gonna have to kill me,
Don' t do this to me,
Don' t do this to me,
I' m not letting go,
No,
Selma, shoot me!
Just shoot me!
Shoot me!
Shoot me!
Shoot me!!
Cant' t you just stand up and pull the goddamn trigger!
I' il have to take the money,
Forgive me,
Selma?
Jeff,
What are you doing here?
Is it already 3: 00?
Hell, I' m always early,
You cut yourself again,
There' s some blood on your blouse,
Strange,
I couldn' t feel it at all,
Selma...
We' re here now,
By the bus stop?
It' s over there,
And the lake is here?
Promise me that you won' t follow me,
Promise,
Yeah, I promise,
Dobry Vecer,
I would like to pay for the operation now, $2, 056... and 1 0 cents,
Well,
What last name shall I put on the receipt?
Oh, I don' t need a receipt,
I really don' t,
When he comes in for his operation,
Novy...
He will come, and he will say that his name is Novy,
And then you will know... that he has been paid for,
Novy?
Like Oldrich Novy, the tap dancer?
It is strange, isn' t it?
But he never really made it over here, did he?
I saw his films when I was a kid,
I ever saw,
Same here,
Selma?
It' s Tuesday night,
What about your rehearsal?
Yeah, I guess,
You want to go?
Yeah,
Then maybe put your arm around her, and... a little bit of...
Hi, Selma,
Hi, Samuel,
We weren' t sure you' d show up, actually,
Sure, I' d show up,
Hi,
Nice to see you,
Be right back,
She' s here,
Okay,
Okay,
Okay, I think -- I think you could... try it one more time for me,
But I should -- I should be going now,
I think Gene may wonder where I am,
Jeff, he -- he hasn' t seen me all day,
I think maybe we could do your scene,
Okay?
We haven' t done it in weeks, and we really need to rehearse it, and while you' re here, we might as well take advantage of the time, please?
Okay, let' s do the tapping scene,
Let me have the nuns up there,
Imagi -- you' re going to do
Selma' s part for her for right now, all right?
You like it?
We haven' t done it for a while,
Remember that part we did where -- where you, uh... you come to the convent gate to say goodbye to the -- to Maria?
I should leave, Jeff,
What?
Gene -- Gene is probably worried now,
All right,
I' m sorry, Samuel, but...
The drummer that you wanted --
Remember, you asked me for a drummer?
I found somebody, She' s fantastic,
Her name' s Betty, She' s right here for the first time tonight,
Please meet her, Selma, this is Betty,
Hi, Betty,
You play the drums?
Tell her how long you' ve been studying,
Two years,
She' s wonderful,
You' ve got to stay and enjoy this,
You' ve got to -- I have an idea,
Let' s do the finale,
I just remembered, you hate finales,
No finale!
I' ve a better idea,
"Climb Every Mountain," part one,
The state will show that the defendant has not only perpetrated the most callous... and well- planned homicide in recent memory... but is also a fundamentally selfish individual... who cynically hides behind a handicap, devoid of sympathy for anybody but herself,
This woman found trust and friendship when she sought refuge in our country, and the evidence will show that she has repaid such kindness with betrayal, robbery, and murder, inflicted upon the very people who opened their homes and hearts to her,
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...
The evidence will prove that she herself... did not show that mercy she will ask of us,
Is this the bag here, detective?
Yes, the very same,
Houston' s blood was all over it,
Well, shortly before the homicide,
I had a checkup on her vision, and I found that she was myopic,
She could see,
Yes,
She said communism was... better for human beings,
She had nothing but contempt for our great country and its principles?
Apart from its musicals, She said the American one... the American ones were better,
So... the defendant preferred Hollywood to Vladivostok,
I suppose that' s an acknowledgement of sorts,
She just asked many times about the money,
She wanted to know where it was?
That' s right,
She asked you about the gun?
She wanted to know where it was kept?
That' s right.
Bill was lying on the floor and... he was wounded,
And...
Yes,
"I -- I beg you, I beg you,
I beg you, "
You showed him no mercy, Selma!
You shall have no mercy either!
Would you state your name for the record, please?
Selma Jezkova,
And Bill and Linda Houston... were your friends, is that right?
Yeah,
In fact, you lived in a trailer on their property,
Yeah,
And didn' t they also take care of your young son when you were at work?
Yeah,
Is that right?
Right,
Your sight was poor, you claim, contrary to the expert testimony we have received,
But you saw well enough to inflict 34 wounds on Bill Houston,
So why did you kill him, actually?
If I may be so bold to ask?
He asked me to,
He did?
How intriguing,
A man with a fine career and some wealth, a happy marriage, why would this Bill Houston ask you to kill him?
I promised not to say,
Well, that clears things up immensely,
You promised you wouldn' t say,
Just, uh...
Just where did you get your money?
I' d been saving up,
Well, I suppose you could call it that,
What were these savings to be used for?
You never bought your son so much as a single birthday present, as we' ve heard,
Yes?
In Czechoslovakia,
Your father?
And what, pray tell... is his name?
My -- my father is...
Oldrich Novy,
He asked you to,
Just as we' re meant to believe that you sent all you had to your father back home, a man by the name of Oldrich Novy,
Is that right?
Yes,
Thank you, Miss Jezkova,
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you' ve now heard from the defendant' s own lips,
You must believe her, just as you must believe her when she claims her father' s name is Oldrich Novy,
Oldrich Novy,
Please state your full name,
The name is Oldrich Novy,
And you used to live in Czechoslovakia?
That is right,
I live now in California, as you know,
That' s right, that' s where we found you,
What exactly is your relationship with the defendant?
I do not know her,
You don' t know her?
Money that -- that... she says was so dearly earned?
No, I have not,
Perhaps you' re not her father then?
No, I am not,
Well, if this relationship was made up by the defendant, then... can you think of any way she might' ve come to know your name?
I was once well known in Czechoslovakia uh... because of my profession,
Yes, Mr, Oldrich Novy, what is your profession?
Maybe that can give us a clue to why, why this somewhat... romantic, certainly communistic, woman who worships Fred Astaire but not his country, why she might' ve lied... and misused your name... to make us think all her money was spent on a poor father and not on her own vanity,
What is it that you do?
I was an actor, I made films,
They were musicals.
Say it again!
Will the court please rise?
Have you reached a verdict?
Yes, Your Honor,
Will the defendant please rise?
We, the jury, find the defendant
Selma Jezkova guilty of murder in the first degree and hereby sentence her to death,
Is this the verdict of this jury?
You fully understand that it must be unanimous?
Selma Jezkova...
You are hereby sentenced to be taken from this place and confined in the state penitentiary until such time as you shall be executed by being hanged by the neck until you are dead.
This court is adjourned.
All rise!
Yeah, I...
I just want to talk practical stuff,
On Gene' s birthday... he will receive a letter,
And it' s so important, Kathy... that he reads it really carefully,
I need you to take care of that for me... because I' m not gonna be there when he gets it,
He should not be afraid, because there' s nothing to be afraid of, Kathy,
Listen, Gene wants to see you so badly,
Please?
There' s nothing for him to see,
He' s got you now, Kathy.
And there' s one more thing:
He has to call himself Novy,
That' s very important,
All right, time' s up, Selma,
I know that sounds a bit foolish,
Novy?
I' m sorry I didn' t tell you before about all this, I just didn' t dare to because they would ruin everything,
But what -- Why does he have to call himself Novy?
Stop asking questions like that, Cvalda,
Iet me tell Gene hello... from you to him,
No,
I know you love your son very much,
I love him very much,
Got a boy of my own back home,
You never told me that,
Good night, Brenda,
Good night,
Say hi to your son from me,
Thank you, Selma,
Can I help you?
Jezkova...
Selma Jezkova?
Well, if it wasn' t too long ago,
I can check my records for you,
Sorry, there' s no one here by that name,
What about Novy?
I have good news for you,
What' s that?
We found a new lawyer... and he' s going to get your case re- opened,
He says your lawyer was incompetent,
What do you mean?
Well, the case is going to be re- opened,
You won' t get the death sentence,
Is that true?
Yes, New information has turned up,
Wh- what information?
Well, we know the whole story, Selma,
Why didn' t you tell us anything?
You know, about... about the money for Gene' s operation,
How did you find out?
Well, Jeff talked to the doctor,
Does -- does Gene know?
I mean, have you told Gene?
No, No, I didn' t,
But you' ve got a much better case now,
That' s very important, Kathy,
His eyes might get worse from worrying, and then the operation won' t work,
Don' t you see that it would help you if they knew that you were trying to save your son from going blind?
The lawyer, he' il come and see you in two weeks' time,
You know they' re hanging me in one week,
We know that, but he says you can apply for a stay,
You know, most cases get one the first time,
Well, you can smile,
Selma...
Yeah... it' s just too much for me,
I just can' t take it, Kathy,
Apply for a stay,
What if they don' t phone?
Uh, well, you' il be transferred to the other... cell block at some point tomorrow,
That' s the cell block where they hang people,
Yeah, that' s where they... spend the last day,
It' s from that room... to the gallows, isn' t it?
That' s what they say, Selma, but...
You' re gonna get your stay,
Why don' t you try to think of something nice, all right?
It' s just so quiet here,
What' s that got to do with it, Selma?
I used to dream that I was in a musical, because, in a musical, nothing dreadful ever happens,
But it' s so quiet here,
Don' t the prisoners march or something?
March?
No,
There' s not...
There' s not much noise around here, Selma,
I know,
But later they turn on the radio,
No, no, no, There' s no...
They don' t allow radio in the isolation block,
But I' ve been listening to the ventilation... shaft,
I hear sometimes people singing there,
Iike... hymns or...
That' s not against the rules, to listen, is it?
No,
I wonder if... if maybe you' re hearing the singing coming from the chapel,
Yeah?
Maybe you' il even get a sermon,
Selma...
You got your stay,
You got the stay,
I' m your new legal counsel,
My name is Luke, okay?
Oh, hi, Luke,
I can get your sentence commuted,
Yeah,
There' s a lot of things your other lawyer didn' t do that I' m going to do,
A lot of ground that wasn' t covered that I am going to cover,
The fact that you were fighting for your boy is something we can really milk,
I have some experience in cases like this, so...
That' s what the attorney before said,
Uh... yeah,
You see, he was appointed by the court, and you don' t get the best legal counsel that way,
Y- You were not appointed by the court?
You' re gonna have to pay me,
Yeah?
That' s been taken care of,
I made a deal with your...
Iady friend?
Yeah, in regard to my fee,
I' ve agreed to accept the amount that she said she could raise,
How much...
How much was it?
Well, I can tell you precisely, because I received an envelope,
It' s, uh, two thousand dollars -- $2, 056, 1 0?
That' s it precisely,
There' s something here,
I' d like to just sort of go over our tactics,
I have a couple of questions to ask you,
If he doesn' t have the operation next month, it' s gonna be too late!
And he will never be able to see!
This is what it' s all about, so he can see his grandchildren!
- Listen to me!
- Waste that kind of money... on a blind woman who' s gonna spend the rest of her life in jail!
You don' t understand!
He needs his eyes!
- No!
Alive!
- No!
Selma,
Selma,
Oh, yes, I will tell that,
I will tell them that, that you stole it from Bill, and you will never see the money again!
No operation!
Nothing!
No mother!
Nothing!
You can have your money back,
Yeah,
You fully realize what will happen?
Yeah,
I already asked for no more stays,
Once this starts, there' s no stopping it,
Yeah,
I' m prepared,
Gene says thank you,
Thanks for what?
Oh, some comic books on his birthday,
You can' t buy him... presents and say it' s from me,
You have to stop doing that, Jeff,
Uh, maybe you can just...
phone him,
Just say, you know... something to him,
No, that' s -- that' s not a good idea,
He wants to be the one... who' s allowed to be there when it happens,
But l -- And then they told him he' s too young,
Who put that crazy idea into his head anyway?
I don' t want him to be there,
I' il be there if you would,
And Kathy?
You know Kathy, She' s...
She' s still angry,
Don' t cry, Jeff,
Why did you have him?
You knew he would have the same disease as you,
I just wanted to hold a little baby...
just in my arms,
I love you,
Okay?
Your meal, Jezkova,
It' s time,
Please stand,
She can walk on her own,
Selma...
I' m afraid my legs aren' t working very well,
You can do it, Selma,
Yeah,
I have a plan, okay?
Yeah,
You' re gonna stand up with me,
I may make some noise,
It will give you something to listen to,
Listen,
Selma, listen to the mark,
I can' t do it!
Now listen, Selma,
Listen,
Two,
39... 40...
43... 44... 45...
55... 56...
93... 94... 95...
1 04... 1 05... 1 06... 1 07,
Selma Jezkova, do you have any last words?
Very well, Proceed,
Selma,
Selma, you okay?
It' s okay, It' s okay,
Come on now,
Use the board,
She can stand up, She can stand,
In here,
It' s okay, It' s okay,
It' s okay,
It' s okay,
The straps on her hands,
I' m scared,
It' s okay,
- I' m so scared!
- I know,
On the mark,
No!
I can' t do the hood!
It' s okay, Selma,
I have to breathe!
Nobody told me about the hood!
It' s just so you can' t see, Selma,
- I can' t breathe!
- I know,
I can' t breathe!
- Look, look -- - I can' t breathe!
I have to breathe!
Look, she can' t breathe,
She can' t breathe!
She can' t --
I' m taking it, I' m taking it,
This is irregular,
I don' t care if it' s irregular,
- We have regulations, - She' s blind --
I don' t care about the regulations!
The girl is blind, for Christ' s sake,
I' m gonna make a call,
Yeah, make the call --
Gene...
Yeah, we have a situation here,
I' il hold for him,
Gene...
The woman' s blind...
I' il wait,
Gene...
Waiting for a call,
Gene...
Gene!
He -- he' s just outside,
He gave me these for you,
Guard,
So he had the operation?
He will see his grandchildren!
He is just outside,
You were right, Selma!
Oh, you’ re gonna miss me, baby
The music or the misery?
literally, thousands of songs about heartbreak, rejection... pain, misery and loss.
Did I listen to pop music because I was miserable... or was I miserable because I listened to pop music?
No.
We' ve done the hard part now.
I might as well --
Why don' t you stay for tonight then?
Laura.
You' re just gonna --
My desert island, all- time top five most memorable breakups... in chronological order... are as follows:
Alison Ashmore, Penny Hardwick...
Jackie Alden, Charlie Nicholson and Sarah Kendrew.
Those were the ones that really hurt.
Can you see your name on that list, Laura?
Maybe you' d sneak into the top ten.
But there' s just no room for you in the top five.
Sorry!
I' m not coming home
Oh
Which brings us to number one on the top five, all- time breakup list...
Alison Ashmore.
Not in any form that interested us, anyway.
They were everywhere, and they' d grown breasts.
- And we wanted -- - I want candy
- I want candy
- My relationship with Alison Ashmore lasted for six hours:
But on the fourth afternoon --
Kevin Bannister.
Slut.
It would be nice to think that since I was 14, times have changed... relationships have become more sophisticated... females less cruel... skins thicker, instincts more developed.
But there seems to be an element of that afternoon in everything that' s happened to me since.
All my romantic stories are a scrambled version of that first one.
Number two on the top five, all- time breakup list was Penny Hardwick.
Penny was great- looking... and her top- five recording artists were Carly Simon, Carole King...
- Me and Susie had so much fun - Erin!
No, come here!
Nice manners, nice grades, nice looking.
She was so nice, in fact, that she wouldn' t let me put my hand... underneath or even on top of her bra.
- Now, when she comes walkin ’ over - Attack and defense.
They were rightfully ours, and we wanted them back.
Crimson and clover
Sometimes I got so bored of trying to touch her breasts that I would try to touch her between her legs.
I was like trying to borrow a dollar, getting turned down and asking for 50 grand instead.
I wasn' t interested in Penny’ s nice qualities, just breasts... and therefore she was no good to me.
What' s the point?
It never goes anywhere.
Rob?
I started dating a girl who everyone said would give it up and who didn' t... and Penny went with this asshole named Chris Thompson who told me that he had sex with her... after something like three dates.
I own this store called Championship Vinyl.
It' s located in a neighborhood that attracts the bare minimum of window shoppers.
I get by because the people make a special effort to shop here.
Mostly young men... who spend all their time looking for deleted Smiths singles... and original -- not re- released, underlined -- Frank Zappa albums.
Fetish properties are not unlike porn.
I' d feel guilty taking their money if I wasn' t... well, kinda one of ‘ em.
- Morning, Dick.
Hi, Rob.
- Have a good weekend?
- Yeah, okay.
Um, I found the first Liquorice Comfits album over at Vintage Vinyl... the one on Testament of Youth.
A Japanese import only.
Great.
- I' il tape it for you.
- No, that' s okay.
Um, Pop Girls, Etc.
Oh, you never saw the cover, though.
Yeah, I haven' t really absorbed that one yet.
Well...
- Okay.
- Dick.
What' s this?
- It' s the new Belle and Sebastian.
Do you like it?
- What the fuck is that?
- It’ s the new Belle and Sebastian that --
It’ s a record we’ ve been listening to and enjoying, Barry.
Well, that’ s unfortunate, because it sucks ass.
Now, baby, I' m sure
Turn it off, Barry!
I --
- On my door - Turn it off!
So, go ahead.
See if I care.
I don’ t wanna hear old sad bastard music, Barry.
I made that tape special for today.
My special Monday morning tape for you, special!
Well, it’ s fucking Monday afternoon!
You should get out of bed earlier!
Come on, dude.
Don’ t you wanna hear what’ s next?
- What’ s next?
- Play it.
Say it.
"Little Latin Loopy- Loo."
- Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?
- No!
- The Righteous Brothers.
- Well, never mind.
- Nothing.
I -- I just prefer the other one.
- Bullshit!
- Since when did this store become a fascist regime?
- Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
Oh, man, that’ s great.
You get to play crappy pap you don’ t even wanna listen to.
I just -- I thought this tape was gonna be a fuckin ’... conversation stimulator, man.
I was gonna ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that... and you just had to fuckin ’ ruin it.
- We’ il do it next Monday.
- No!
I wanna do it now!
I hired these guys for three days a week, and they just started showing up every day.
That was four years ago.
Number three on the top five all- time breakup list?
Charlie Nicholson.
Sophomore year of college.
Am I glad that’ s over.
As soon as I saw her I realized she was the kind of girl I’ d wanted to meet... ever since I was old enough to want to meet girls.
I mean, she was different.
She was dramatic and she was exotic.
And she talked a lot, and when she talked she said remarkably interesting things... about music, books, film and politics.
- And she talked a lot.
No.
No.
And she liked me.
She liked me.
She liked me.
At least I think she did.
- Do you like that one?
- Yeah.
It’ s okay.
We went out for two years, and...
I never got comfortable.
I felt like a fraud.
I felt like one of those people who suddenly shave their heads and said they’ d always been punks.
I was sure I’ d be discovered at any second.
And I worried about my abilities as a lover.
And I was intimidated by other men in her design department... and became convinced she was gonna leave me for one of them.
Charlie, you fucking bitch!
Let’ s work it out!
Just open the fucking door!
Charlie!
Look, let’ s talk it -- Char --
And then I lost it.
Kinda lost it all, you know?
Faith, dignity, about 1 5 pounds.
When I came to a few months later...
I found, to my surprise, I had flunked out of school.
I started working in a record shop.
Some people never got over ’ Nam or the night their band opened for Nirvana.
I guess I never really got over Charlie.
But the thing I learned from the whole Charlie debacle is that you gotta punch your weight.
See, Charlie, she’ s out of my class.
She’ s too pretty, too smart, too witty, too much.
I' m a middleweight.
Hey, I' m not the smartest guy in the world, but I' m certainly not the dumbest.
I mean, I’ ve read books like The Unbearable Lightness of Being... and Love in the Time of Cholera and, uh -- and I think I’ ve understood them.
I mean, they’ re about girls, right?
Just kidding.
But I have to say... my all- time favorite book is Johnny Cash’ s autobiography, Cash by Johnny Cash.
- Championship.
- Hi.
I could come by the house and pick up some stuff while you’ re at work tomorrow.
While I' m at work.
- Oh, boy, oh, boy.
- That’ s what you got to say is, "Oh, boy"?
That’ s --
- Laura, this is just so dumb.
I mean, you should -- - Look, Rob.
"I Just Called to Say I Love You."
- Great.
- We have it.
- Great.
- Can I have it then?
- Why not?
Go to the mall.
- What’ s your problem?
- Do you even know your daughter?
Oh -- Uh, oh, is she in a coma?
Oh, okay, buddy.
I didn’ t know it was Pick On The Middle- Aged Square Guy Day.
My apologies.
I’ il be on my way.
Bye- bye.
Fuck you.
Nice, Barry.
Rob.
Sub- question:
Is it, in fact, unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins?
- Barry, I' m fucking broke, man!
- Jesus!
He was gonna buy one record, which we didn’ t even have, and then leave and never come back again anyway.
- That’ s not the point.
What did he ever do to you?
- He offended me with his terrible taste.
It wasn’ t even his terrible taste.
Are you defending that ass- muncher?
You’ re going soft in your old age.
I' m gonna tell you something for your own good, pal.
A Cosby sweater!
Did Laura let you leave the house like that, because --
Hey!
- What are you do -- - Shut up.
- Uh...
- Will you? - break it up.
Yeah.
Look, Dick, Laura and I broke up.
She’ s gone.
So if you ever see Barry again, maybe you could tell him that.
Of course I will, Rob.
No problem.
No problem at all.
I’ il tell him next time I see him.
Definitely.
I’ ve, uh, got some other stuff to tell him, anyway, so it’ s no problem.
I’ il just tell him, you know, about Laura... um, when I tell him... the other stuff.
Do you want to talk about it, that kind of thing?
No.
Thank you, though, Dick.
Thank you.
Look at these.
Now I know they just save their best pairs for the nights they know they’ re gonna sleep with somebody.
Hello, Laura, this is your mother.
I thought he might like to talk to you.
It’ s no big deal.
I love you two.
Anyway, me and Charlie, we didn’ t match.
Marco and Charlie matched.
We matched.
She’ d just been dumped by some asshole named Michael.
I mean, Michael was such an asshole.
I’ d just been run over by Charlie.
I know exactly what you mean.
I mean, it’ s just so painful and draining.
I' m just gonna be by myself for a while.
Me too.
Me too.
It made sense to pool our collective loathing for the opposite sex.
And while we were at it we could share a bed with somebody at the same time.
We were frightened of being left alone for the rest of our lives.
We were of that disposition.
- So when she told me -- - I’ ve met someone else.
Who?
Just someone else.
It was contrary to the whole spirit of our arrangement.
You think I fuckin ’ look like shit, huh?
So how come I got dumped?
What?
- Hey, Dick.
What is it?
Whoa.
Um, Marie De Salle’ s playing.
You remember I told you about her today?
She’ s kind of Sheryl Crow- ish, crossed with a, um, post- Partridge Family, pre- L. A. Law Susan Dey kind of thing.
- But, you know, um, black.
- Yeah.
So, um, I just wanted to know if you wanted to come along.
Barry thought so too, really, but I guess it looks as if you’ re...
- reorganizing your records.
Yeah.
No.
- Nope.
What?
Autobiographical.
- No fucking way.
- Yep.
- Oh, my God.
I have to remember that I bought it for someone in the fall of 1 983 pile... but didn’ t give it to them for personal reasons.
- That sounds -- - Comforting?
- It is.
- Hello?
- Well, shoo.
I can stick around, you know, man, if you -- I -- if you want me to help out.
- You know?
Okay.
- I’ il see you.
- Hi, Mom.
- How’ s the store?
You know something?
You’ re very lucky that Laura is doing as well as she’ s doing.
She left.
She’ s gone.
What do you mean?
- Where did she go?
- How would I know where?
She’ s gone.
Not say where gone.
- Well, call her mother.
She doesn’ t even know.
- That is not what’ s upsetting me.
- Well, it fuckin ’ should be, shouldn’ t it?
- I knew this would happen.
- What are you gonna do, Rob?
- I' m gonna drink a bottle of wine, I' m gonna watch TV and go to bed.
- Then I' m gonna go to work.
- And then what?
I' m gonna meet a nice girl and have children.
Okay?
- I knew -- I knew it was gonna happen again.
- It’ s got nothing to do with marriage.
- So you say!
- Mom, I' m telling you for the last time.
Laura didn’ t even want to get married.
- That’ s not what happens now.
Apart from you meet someone, you move in, she goes!
You meet someone, you move in, she goes!
Shut up, Mom!
God dam!
That’ s some cold shit.
John Dillinger was shot dead behind that theatre in a hail of FBl gunfire.
His fuckin ’ girlfriend.
Is that Peter fucking Frampton?
- Wanna tell you I love - What?
Hey.
- I always hated that song.
- Now I kinda like it.
Yeah.
She should’ ve done it on The Number Four with a Smile.
Wasn’ t her record called Number Four with a Smile?
- No, no.
You said "The Number Four with a Smile."
There’ s no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
- You can be, and are, wrong.
- Wanna tell you I love your way
I wanna be with you night and day
I wanna date a musician. - ’ Cause I - I wanna live with a musician.
Maybe a little picture of me in the liner notes.
- Don’ t hesitate - Yeah.
- So, um, do you live in Chicago now?
Do you love it?
- Championship Vinyl.
- Oh, my God, yes.
- We sell a little bit of anything that matters.
- Rock, soul, trip- hop, salsa.
- Ska, techno and pop.
- Will you come?
- Yeah, Marie.
- Okay, okay.
- Sounds good.
- Championship Vinyl.
- Championship Vinyl.
- Enjoyed your set.
- Barry, why’ d you tell her about the store, man?
- Oh, man, I' m sorry.
I didn’ t know it was classified information.
I mean, I know we don’ t have any customers, but I thought that was a bad thing... not, like, a business strategy.
It’ s Liz.
Just calling to see if, you know, well, you’ re okay.
- Shadows grow so long before my eyes - Give me a call.
Bye.
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?
- Took the morning off.
- Come on, Rob.
Do you still love me?
Well, it’ s not really the issue, is it?
Why?
I mean, what else is there?
What else is there?
I don’ t know.
It doesn’ t change the way we don’ t get along at all.
- Come on!
- What should I have done to make you happy?
- Nothing.
Oh, I see.
Um, wh- why am I not happy?
- And all I’ ve done is change jobs.
- Clothes and hairstyles.
- Attitudes and friends.
- I couldn’ t go to work with my hair dyed pink.
- You’ re harder.
- Oh, come on, Laura.
Now you’ re just being stupid.
Now you don’ t even do that.
- Look, I' m all right.
- See?
You haven’ t got a clue.
All I' m saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people... most of all to yourself.
And you don’ t, Rob.
So what’ s the use?
Rob, it’ s your turn.
Okay, I' m feeling kinda basic today.
Top Five Side Ones, Track Ones.
"Janie Jones," The Clash, from The Clash.
"Let’ s Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let’ s Get It On. "
Nirvana, "Smells Like Teen Spirit," off of Never mind.
Not at all.
How about, uh, "Point of No Return" on Point of No Return?
- Louis, you couldn’ t get up -- - Shut up.
- "White Light/ White Heat," Velvet Underground.
- Though not on mine.
- And Massive Attack, No Protection.
- The song is "Radiation Ruling the Nation."
- Kind of a new record.
Very -- - Excuse me.
I was in here last night -- - In a minute.
Very nice, Rob.
A sly declaration of new classic status slipped into a list of old safe ones.
Very pussy.
- Excuse me, I was in here last -- - In a minute.
Couldn’ t you be any more obvious than that, Rob?
How about, uh, I don’ t know, the Beatles?
How about fucking -- fucking Beethoven?
Track one, side one of the Fifth Symphony.
How can someone who has no interest in music own a record store?
Do you still have that, uh, Beefheart French import, Safe as Milk?
Um, let’ s see.
Yes.
Yes -- Oh, no.
You know what?
- I don’ t think I' m selling it this week.
- Oh, no.
Did I?
Yeah, well, I just -- I -- Uh --
I’ il buy it for 40.
- Rob?
- Sold.
- Now, why would you sell it to me and not to him?
- Because you’ re not a geek, Louis.
- No, seriously, you’ re totally elitist.
- Which is everybody.
- Yes.
It’ s just sad, that’ s all.
I' m sick of the sight of this place.
- Hello.
- Hey, Liz.
- Hey, Rob.
Oh.
Well, how are you holding up?
Good.
Good.
I mean, look, maybe we’ re just not right for each other, right?
Yeah.
I don’ t know.
I -- I don’ t want to take sides and --
I think you guys are good together.
And I don’ t think much of this Ian guy.
Rob, Marie De Salle is in the store.
I gotta go, Liz.
- We should maybe turn off her music.
- I know.
Hey.
Yeah.
You might be sick of it.
- Oh, right, yeah.
- Yeah.
Hmm.
- Yeah, I got the, uh -- Excuse me.
Okay?
What fucking Ian guy?
Laura doesn’ t know anybody called Ian.
There’ s no Ian in her office.
She has no friends called Ian!
I' m almost certain she has never met anyone named Ian in her entire life.
She lives in an...
"Ian- less" universe.
"I. Raymond."
Ray.
"I."
Ian.
Mr. I. Raymond.
Ray to his friends, and more importantly to his neighbor.
The guy who, until about six weeks ago, lived upstairs.
I start to remember things about him now.
His horrible clothes and hair.
Latin, Bulgarian, whatever world music was trendy that week.
He had rings on his fingers.
Awful cooking smells.
I never liked him much then, and I fuckin ’ hate him now.
We used to listen to him having sex upstairs.
Jeez, he goes on long enough.
I should be so lucky.
It feels so good
You are as abandoned and noisy as any character in a porn film, Laura.
You are Ian’ s plaything, responding to his touch with shrieks of orgasmic delight.
Oh, baby, give it up
Number five:
Jackie Alden.
Jackie Alden’ s breakup had no effect on my life whatsoever.
It was a casual thing, and I was glad when it ended.
I just slotted her in to bump Laura out of position.
But now, congratulations, Laura.
You made it to the top five.
Number five with a bullet.
Won’ t somebody please
Do you have soul?
What this one love’ s done to me
Championship Vinyl.
Yeah, I' m interested.
What’ s your address?
- Hey, Liz.
You fucking asshole!
Hi, Barry.
My time in the world Have you heard
For a couple of years I was a deejay at a club.
I was good at it, I think... and while I was doing it is the happiest I’ ve ever been.
And that’ s where I met Laura.
She was already a lawyer, but she worked for Legal Aid... hence the leatherjacket and the clubbing.
Oh, I liked her right away.
- Hey!
- Hey!
- That’ s a kick- ass record.
- What?
- Um, what’ s your name?
- Laura.
I was gonna say, come back next week and I’ il make you a tape.
- All right.
Thank you.
- Okay?
- Rob.
- I' m still Laura.
To be honest, I hadn’ t met anyone as promising as Laura since I started deejaying... and meeting promising women is kind of what the deejaying thing is supposed to be about.
And anyway, we -- we moved on from there.
She lost her lease on her apartment in Lakeview, and she moved in with me.
And it stayed that way for years.
She didn’ t make me miserable, or anxious... or ill- at- ease.
And you know, it sounds boring, but it wasn’ t.
It wasn’ t spectacular, either.
It was just... good.
But really good.
So, how come I' m suddenly an asshole?
I get the feeling that Liz talked to Laura... and Liz stuck up for me... and Laura told her a few things.
I don’ t know what precisely Laura said, but she would have revealed at least two, maybe even all four of the following pieces of information.
One: that I slept with someone else...
- He slept with somebody else.
- What? while she, Laura, was pregnant.
- While I was pregnant.
- No!
Two: that my affair directly contributed --
Pretty much directly to me terminating the pregnancy.
- No.
- Three: that after the abortion, I borrowed a large sum of money from her...
- Four grand or so. - and have not, as of yet, repaid any of it.
The bastard!
Four: that shortly before she left me...
I told her that I was kind of unhappy in the relationship... and maybe sort of looking around for someone else.
He was "sort of, maybe" looking around for somebody else.
- Did I do and say those things?
- Yes.
- No!
- Yes, I did.
I am a fuckin ’ asshole.
- That’ s it.
- Liz -- No.
Sit down.
That’ s shocking.
That is shocking.
Laura had it and I didn’ t.
And she wanted to give it to me.
I’ ve never been able to pay her back because I’ ve never been able to.
Just because she moved in with some Supertramp fan... it doesn’ t make me five grand richer.
And number two, this stuff about me half- looking around for someone else?
She tricked me into saying it.
And did I agree?
And I said yes.
And she asked me whether I ever thought about meeting other people.
So then I asked her if she ever thought about meeting someone else.
She says, "Of course." So I admit that, yes, I daydream about it from time to time.
Now I can see what we were really talking about is her and Ian... and she suckered me into absolving her.
It was a sneaky lawyer’ s trick and I fell for it... because she’ s much smarter than me.
All right, then the pregnancy.
I didn’ t know she was pregnant.
Of course I didn’ t.
I didn’ t know because she hadn’ t told me.
She hadn’ t told me because I had told her that I had sor -- Yes, I’ d slept with someone else.
So I didn’ t find out she was pregnant till way later.
We were going through this good period and I made some crack about having kids and --
- What? - and she just burst into tears.
And I said, "Well, what is it," you know.
"What --"
What right do you have?
My child too -- blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Who needs a drink?
Who loves the sun
What’ s wrong with me?
Seriously.
What happened?
Why am I doomed to be left?
Doomed to be rejected?
Number one.
To Alison Ashmore.
- This is, uh, Rob Gordon calling.
- I' m an old friend of Alison’ s and, um --
- What did you say your name was?
- Rob.
Rob Gordon.
Um, I was actually her -- her first boyfriend in- in- in the seventh grade... and I was just wondering if you had any way of reaching her or her number or --
I hate to quibble with you, Rob, but Alison married her first boyfriend.
Kevin Bannister.
He is her first and last boyfriend.
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Uh, no, I' m quite serious.
She is Mrs. Kevin Bannister.
She lives in Australia.
- We went out together in the seventh grade.
- I beg your pardon.
Well, technically, I' m her first boyfriend, okay?
I met her a few days before Kevin did.
Me.
- I don’ t know what you mean by "technically."
Me.
I’ ve got to go now, Bob.
Okay, bye- bye.
Alison married Kevin!
I am fine now!
Married her junior high school sweetheart.
Kissed me on the bench.
Married Kevin.
This is great!
This has got nothing to do with me.
This is destiny.
I want more.
I want to see the others on the big top five.
I wanna see Penny and Charlie and Sarah, all of them, you know.
Just see’ em and talk to’ em, you know, like a Bruce Springsteen song.
You call, you ask’ em how they are, and you see if they’ ve forgiven you.
Yeah, and then -- and then I’ d feel good.
And they’ d feel good.
No, they’ d feel good maybe, but you’ d feel better.
I’ d feel clean and calm.
That’ s what you’ re looking for.
You wanna get ready to start again, that’ d be good for you.
Great, even.
You’ d give that big final "good luck and goodbye" to your all- time top five and just move on down the road.
Good luck.
Thanks, Boss.
Penny is as beautiful as she was in high school and really grown into herself.
She reviews movies for a living, which is unassailably cool... even if she does make these little notes with this little flashlight pen.
We have a good time, and we hate the same actors, and everything’ s going great.
She tells me about her life.
We both get it.
We both relate.
And then, with no real explanation, I just launch into it.
I tell her about how Laura wanted to sleep with Ian and not me...
Charlie wanted to sleep with Marco and not me...
Alison Ashmore wanted Kevin Bannister and not me.
And you, you wanted to -- you wanted to have sex with Chris Thompson... and not me.
And I was helping -- hoping you could help me understand why this keeps happening... why, you know, I' m doomed to be left, doomed to be rejected.
Do you understand?
Well, Rob, uh, I was crazy about you.
I wanted to sleep with you one day, but not when I was 16.
You know, when you broke up with me -- you broke up with me because I was, I was... to use your charming expression, tight...
I cried and I cried and I hated you... and when that little shit bag asked me out and I was too tired to fight him off... it wasn’ t rape, because I said okay, but it wasn’ t far off.
You know I couldn’ t have sex until after college because I hated it so much?
That’ s when you’ re supposed to have sex, Rob -- in college!
And now you want to have a little chat about rejection.
Well, fuck you, Rob.
God, she’ s right.
I broke up with her.
I rejected her.
I should’ ve done this years ago.
Ma’ am, could I get the cheque, please?
Next up, Charlie.
But I' m not quite ready for that... so I go directly to number four on the all- time breakup list.
Sarah, my partner in rejection who rejected me.
- Hi, Rob.
- Hi.
- Nice to see you.
- You want me to come -- - You wanna -- - Sure.
- You wanna -- - Yeah.
- Probably seemed like a good idea at the time, Sarah.
- Yeah, I don’ t know why, though.
- Are you seeing anybody?
- Um, no, yeah.
- No?
- Yeah.
I mean, I' m not -- - No.
I' m in between things.
- No.
Oh, it’ s so hard.
The medication I was on is not working.
So we’ re trying something else, but it’ s like, they don’ t know about it, so I' m like a guinea pig, and --
But I' m making money.
That’ s good, ‘ cause I lost my job a month ago.
I' m late for work, and I -- I’ il call you.
- Nice to see you.
- Bye.
See you later.
And what better way to exorcise rejection demons than to screw the person who rejected you, right?
But you wouldn’ t be sleeping with a person.
You’ d be sleeping with a whole, sad single- person culture.
It’ d be like sleeping with Talia Shire in Rocky if you weren’ t Rocky.
I feel guilty enough as it is.
There’ s only Charlie left now.
She should be living on Neptune.
She’ s an extraterrestrial.
- Hi, this is Charlie.
- Answering machine.
- Leave me a message -- - I’ il leave a nice, polite message and she’ il never call back.
Oh, the Killing Moon EP, it’ s almost impossible to find, especially on CD.
- But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album -- - Yeah, I have all the other ones.
Oh, you do?
Well, how about the Jesus and Mary Chain?
- Ah, they always seemed -- - They always seemed what?
Jesus!
- Can I get two receipts with that?
- Well, the interesting thing about Green Day... is that so much of their music is, in truth... directly influenced by, in my opinion, uh, two bands --
- The Clash -- - The Clash.
Uh, correct, uh, the Clash.
Uh, but also by this band called, uh, Stiff Little Fingers.
Um, I think you would really love this band.
Uh, it sounds great.
- My name’ s Anaugh.
- The name --
Is this the new Green Day?
That is perverse.
Don’ t tell anybody you don’ t own fucking Blonde on Blonde.
Say it loud It’ il be okay
- You can say it loud, it’ il be okay - Who is that?
- It’ s the Beta Band.
I know.
The door!
- Go!
Go!
- Go, go, go, go!
Okay, fuckos, how much is this deck worth to you, and how much did you steal?
Can you do the math?
- Barry, call the cops.
- No!
- Hold up, hold up.
Ryuichi Sakamoto, Sigue Sigue Sputnik, Breakbeats, Serge Gainsbourg.
- No, those are for us.
- You guys slamming to Joni Mitchell now?
- Man, you’ re, like, so bigoted.
- I think you have more.
Hi.
- What do you want?
- I thought I could give you a ride back.
- Are you coming home?
My house.
How’ d it go today?
All right.
- Do you want to go?
- Sure.
You bet.
You can take this with you if you want.
Look at this place.
Laura, it’ s a dump.
What are you making now?
Sixty, seventy a year?
And you were living in this shithole.
Bet you can’ t even remember what you were doing here.
I was here because I wanted to be with you.
It had nothing to do with this place.
So, uh, where are you staying now?
I think you know that.
- I had to work that out for myself, though, didn’ t I?
- I' m sorry.
I know I haven’ t been very fair.
It took me a while to work up the courage.
- You scared now?
- Yes, of course I am.
I feel terrible, Rob.
You know, this is really hard.
So how is everything going with Ian?
Is it working out okay?
- You’ re living with the guy.
- Don’ t.
I' m just asking you how it’ s going.
Look, I' m not living with the guy, okay?
I' m just staying with him for a few days until I figure out what I' m doing.
I left because we weren’ t exactly getting along, and we weren’ t talking about it.
I' m getting to a point where I want to get my shit together... and I can’ t really see that ever happening with you.
And, yes, I sort of got interested in someone else.
And that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.
But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.
So, what?
Is that it?
There’ s still a chance we might get back together?
- I don’ t know.
- Well, if you don’ t know... there’ s a chance, right?
I mean, it would be like if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill... and the doctor said, "I don’ t know if this patient has a chance of survival or not."
That doesn’ t mean that the patient’ s definitely gonna die now, does it?
- Even if it’ s a remote possibility.
- I suppose so.
- So we have a chance of not -- - Shut up, Rob.
- I just want to know where I stand here.
What chance do we have?
- What --
- I don’ t know what chance we have.
- lf you could tell me roughly -
All right, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together.
- Nine?
- Great.
- Look, I know I' m asking a lot... but could you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?
No problem.
- You want me to leave my own house?
- Yes, please.
One.
- You’ re not gonna like it.
- Just ask it.
- Is it better?
- Is what better?
Well, sex, I guess.
Is it better?
- Is that really what’ s bothering you?
- Yes.
Yes, of course.
Do you really think it would make a difference either way?
- I don’ t know.
- Never?
No.
I was living with you, remember?
We’ ve slept together, but we haven’ t made love.
Not yet.
- What?
Sleeping together is better.
Sleeping together is better?
But not the sex, because you haven’ t done it yet?
- Will you please just go?
- Till the end - I feel good.
- I feel so much better, in fact...
- We are the champions
- that I go straight out and sleep with Marie De Salle.
- No time for losers ‘ Cause we are the champions
"How could this have happened?" you ask.
"How does he -- How does he do it?"
How does a regular guy like me become the number one lover man in his particular postal district?
He’ s broke.
He hangs out with the musical moron twins... and yet he gets to go to bed with somebody like Marie De Salle.
Marie.
- Yeah, yeah.
She just wanted to pick up some stuff, you know.
- You know that song I play, "Eartha Kitt Times Two"?
I wrote that about me and my ex dividing our record collection.
It’ s a great, great song.
- I wrote that just before I moved here. that what really matters is what you like... not what you are like.
Books, records, films -- These things matter.
It’ s the fuckin ’ truth.
And by this measure, I was having one of the best dates of my life.
- You love that show?
- McGoohan.
- Patrick McGoohan.
- That’ s right!
And then we talk about our exes.
She’ s dry and self- deprecating.
Great sense of humour about it, and I can really see why her songs are so good.
- I don’ t speak about Laura with as much depth.
But it feels, even to me, like I' m being intimate.
I express regret.
I say nice things about her... and I hint at a deep ocean of melancholy just below the surface... which is all bullshit really.
I’ ve just invented a sketch of a decent, sensitive guy... because I' m in the position to invent him.
And I guess all that charming, nervous stuff seems to work somehow... because we get back to her house and...
It’ s great.
- I don’ t need them any more - And that’ s it.
I' m not gonna go into all that other stuff.
You know, the who- did- what- to- whom stuff.
You know that song "Behind Closed Doors" by Charlie Rich?
It’ s one of my favorite songs.
- I can say we had a good time.
I can say that.
Marie’ s a terrific woman.
But it was more than I could do
And then in the morning --
You didn’ t have me fooled... acting all cool about, um, what’ s- her- name.
- Laura, right, right.
Laura.
- What was yours called again?
- It was called James.
- James.
Do you miss him?
That’ s how it works, right?
I think it’ s okay if you feel horny and fucked up at the same time.
I mean, why should we be denied our basic human rights... just ’ cause we messed up our relationships?
You think sex is a basic human right?
Hell, yeah!
- Which way are you going?
- That way.
You?
- That way.
- Ah, so it is.
- Talk to ya.
- I’ il call you.
Right.
Yet!
What does "yet" mean anyway?
Just come on.
What would it mean to you, that sentence:
"I haven’ t seen Evil Dead 2 yet"?
You’ ve seen it twice.
Once with Laura -- oops -- and once with me and Dick, remember?
All right, but let’ s just say that I hadn’ t seen it... and I said to you, "I haven’ t seen Evil Dead 2 yet," what would you think?
I’ d think that you’ re a cinematic idiot, and I’ d feel sorry for you.
All right.
But from that one sentence, would you think that I was going to see it?
I' m sorry, Rob.
You’ re asking me what would I think if you told me... you hadn’ t seen a film that you have already seen.
- What am I supposed to say?
- Just listen to me. lf I said to you --
"I haven’ t seen Evil Dead 2 yet," yes.
Would you get the impression that I really wanted to see it?
I' m not gonna see that movie.
But the word "yet."
Yeah, you know what?
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
How the fuck am I supposed to know?
Probably.
- Why?
- Because it’ s a brilliant film.
It’ s so funny and violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.
I never thought I’ d say this, but can I go work now?
Look, Laura, if you don’ t want me to call you at work, then give me your home number.
Oh, I forgot.
I mean, I' m sorry, but I don’ t just see why this has to be on your terms...
- I mean, really.
- Okay!
We’ il meet then tonight.
That’ d -- That’ d be great if you’ re not too busy.
It’ il be really good to... see you.
So how are you?
Have you slept with him yet?
- Is that why you wanted to see me?
- I guess.
What do you want me to say?
I want you to say you haven’ t, and I want that to be the truth.
I can’ t do that.
You must have known it would happen.
You couldn’ t have been entirely unprepared.
Like you said, I’ ve been living with the guy.
We were bound to get around to it sometime.
Rob, are you there?
What are you thinking?
We can meet for another drink if you want.
So I can explain it better.
I owe you that much.
I don’ t have your number.
I know what you’ re like.
I need a second opinion.
Uh, Chicago.
- May I also have that address?
- Certainly.
- Thank you.
- Rob?
- Laura, I just want to say something.
You’ re running from a, a sharp point... that anybody hits in any relationship, and it’ s just gonna happen again.
But it’ s gonna be with this guy Ian, later, when you’ re older.
With a guy with a Steven Seagal ponytail.
You know what I' m saying?
And he doesn’ t understand you, not the way I will.
And I will even more so in the future.
And --
Why don’ t you go experiment?
- Laura, are you okay?
- Uh, yeah, I' m fine.
- Is that him?
- Look, can you -- Can you call me at work?
- You look upset.
- Yeah, I' m -- I' m upset... but I' m fine.
- Maybe I should talk to him.
- No, I don’ t think that’ s a good idea.
- Conflict resolution is my job.
- Yeah, I know.
But -- But, Ian, there’ s really nothing to resolve, but thank you.
You’ re really upsetting her and him!
- Like I care about him.
- Well, you should.
- Why?
Them against you!
Before you started all this psychotic madness, there was no unit.
But now they’ ve got something in common.
- Come on, Liz.
- Rob, Rob, Rob.
Why do you want Laura back so badly?
Rob, phone.
Barry, that fucking pricer’ s busted, and I' m not the one who broke it.
- Rob?
Who is this?
Is this Ch -- Is this Charlie?
Hi.
Wow!
Rob Gordon.
The Rob Gordon.
Huh?
Does it seem like millions of years ago?
Like a billion, right?
So, uh -- God, Charlie Nicholson.
No, I' m too young, too single.
Kids are too time- consuming, I guess, is the expression I' m looking for.
I' m not making this up.
She’ s incredible.
So, anyway, are you in or out, Rob?
- I' m sorry?
- Well, you know -- I don’ t know.
- There’ s been a rash of them recently.
- Is that right?
I went out with him after you.
- Kind of.
- Kind of, yeah.
Well, he called a few months ago.
I think he was going through one of those what- does- it- all- mean kind of things.
He wanted to see me and "rehash the past," as they say.
Was I up for that?
So -- I don’ t know --
- Do all men go through that?
I' m sorry, Charlie, but what does "Are you in or out" mean?
Well, it means, are we friends or aren’ t we?
Because if we are, that’ s great.
But if we’ re not, I don’ t really want to spend time playing catch- up on the phone.
You know what I mean?
I’ m just really busy, you know?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
- So, are you in or out, Rob?
Oh, yeah?
Can I help you?
- As it slide across your windowpane - Hello, Rob.
Remember me?
Ian.
You know, sort things out.
- What needs sorting out?
- Ten phone calls a night.
Hanging around outside my house.
- I’ ve stopped all of that now.
- You were there this morning.
Obviously, I know how special Laura is, and I know how... much pain you must be going through right now.
Oh.
Guess who?
But I’ d like to believe that if she decided... that she didn’ t want to see me any more that...
I would respect those wishes.
You know what I' m saying, G?
- Yeah.
So shall we leave it at that then?
I’ ve already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck!
Now, get your patchouli stink out of my store!
Move it, lard- ass!
So, um, shall we leave it at that then?
No.
Don’ t!
- Leave town!
Get ready, motherfucker!
So shall we leave it at that then?
- Get him, man!
Okay?
Hey, jelly bean.
Charles.
- Good.
How are you?
It’ s hilarious.
Hey, everybody!
Everybody, this is Rob.
- Hi.
Is that for me?
- Oh, it’ s a little warm.
- Your place doesn’ t have a yard, does it?
- Of course you do.
- You gotta take care of it, raise it -- - Yeah, but --
- Do you want a drink?
- Yeah, I would.
I can see now that I' m doomed to die... a long, slow suffocating death, and I try to figure out why.
Why isn’ t my life like this?
And I’ d like to have advice on jet lag, but that’ s not it.
It’ s something else.
And I was very supportive -- - And then it dawned on me.
- It came down to me to tell him the truth.
- Charlie’ s awful.
What was the truth?
- She doesn’ t listen to anyone.
Well, I have --
- You’ re right.
I have to talk -- and talks shit all night long.
- Maybe she’ s been like this all along.
- Bye- bye.
- Call me tomorrow, okay?
- Thanks for having us.
Bye.
How had I made this girl the answer to all the world’ s problems?
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey, Rob.
So, Charlie, why’ d you dump me for Marco?
Fuck!
I knew it!
I knew it!
Fuck!
Fuck!
- You are.
- I can’ t believe you, Rob.
- Yes, I am.
- Come on.
Oh, come on, Charlie.
Don’ t hold back.
You can say whatever you like.
Why’ d you dump me for Marco?
Marco just seemed to be a bit more glamorous.
You know?
More sure of himself.
A little sunnier.
Through the park Make love along the way
- In Mendocino - You put that ad up?
- Yeah.
- What can you play?
Nothin ’.
What kind of stuff are you into?
The kind of stuff you mentioned.
We want to retain our pop sensibilities, but, kind of, you know, go a little further out.
- That sounds great.
- No gigs yet.
We just got together.
Is Tuesday night cool for you?
- What I have told you
- Yeah.
- What?
You’ ve had that poster up on the wall for, like, 1 7, 000 years.
It’ s nothing special.
- Barry, you don’ t even play an instrument.
- I can sing.
What, you think I' m gonna stick around here the rest of my life?
Hey, it’ s half past a monkey’ s ass.
- That’ s the way it is in Mendocino - Why?
- Who are you going to see?
- Mendocino - Nobody.
- Rob!
Lookie, lookie!
Dick, are you getting some?
Un- fucking- believable!
Dick’ s got a hot date!
How did this happen, Dick?
What’ s her name?
- Anaugh?
- Anaugh Moss.
- Anaugh Moss?
Is she all green and fuzzy and mossy?
The home for the mentally challenged or the blind or the bus station?
Um, here.
She asked me about the, uh, new Green Day album...
Anaugh.
That’ s great, Dick!
Really, smoke that ass.
Listen, Rob, I can’ t go to the club either.
I gotta get some lyrics down on paper.
Oh, yeah, me too.
Well, not, uh, lyrics to get down.
But, um, uh -- So I’ il see you, um, tomorrow.
- Hi, Laura.
- "Top five dream jobs."
- "Number one:" journalist for Rolling Stone magazine, 1 976 to 1 979.
"Get to meet the Clash, Chrissie Hynde, Sex Pistols, David Byrne.
"Get tons of free records.
Number two: "producer, Atlantic Records, 1 964 to 1 971.
Get to meet Aretha, Wilson Pickett, Solomon Burke. "
- More free records.
- "Number three: any kind of musician."
Besides classical or rap.
- Uh- huh.
- "Number four: film director."
- Any kind except German or silent.
And number five, we have "architect."
- Seven years ’ training.
- I' m not sure I even want to be an architect.
- So you’ ve got a list here... of five things you’ d do if qualifications... and time and history and salary were no object?
- Yeah.
- One of them you don’ t really want to do anyway.
- Yeah, I suppose.
- And you wouldn’ t want to be a... 1 6th- century explorer or the king of France or --
- God, no.
- All right.
There you go then.
I find it interesting that you keep showing up here, Laura.
Well, this is the last of it.
Those bags look heavy.
Where’ s Ian?
Or Ray or -- What is his fucking name anyway?
- What do you call him?
- Ray.
- I hate Ian.
- I hate him too.
Yeah, I' m sure.
See ya.
Goodbye.
Top five things I miss about Laura.
One: sense of humour.
And she’ s got one of the best all- time laughs in the history of all- time laughs.
She laughs with her entire body.
She’ s got character.
Or at least she had character before the Ian nightmare.
She’ s loyal and honest and... she doesn’ t even take it out on people when she’ s having a bad day.
That’ s character.
Three:
I miss her smell... and the way she tastes.
It’ s a mystery of human chemistry, and I don’ t understand it.
Some people, as far as your senses are concerned, just feel like home.
I really dig how she walks around.
It’ s like she doesn’ t care how she looks or what she projects.
And it’ s not that she doesn’ t care, it’ s just -- She’ s not affected, I guess.
And that gives her grace.
And five:
She kind of half- moans and then rubs her feet together an equal number of times.
It just kills me.
Believe me, I mean, I could do a top- five- things about her that drive me crazy... but it’ s just your garden variety women, you know, schizo stuff... and that’ s the kind of thinking that got me here.
You maggots!
Toss it, man!
- You’ re pretty when you’ re angry.
- Shit!
- Hey, Rob, Laura called.
- It’ s Vince and Justin.
- Who’ s Vince and Justin?
- It’ s those little skate fuckers.
- No way.
- Way.
It’ s really --
It’ s really fuckin ’ good.
Hey, do you guys know Vince and Justin, the guys that come in my store?
- Quit smoking.
I' m telling you should -- - Hey!
- It’ s good.
- I know.
- It’ s all right.
I mean, it’ s rough, but, unbelievably, it shows promise.
I’ il put out your record.
Any profits we split down the middle after I recoup expenses, okay?
Recoup expenses?
Man, you’ re gonna recoup a big, fat Mercedes is what you’ re gonna do.
- We’ re not there yet, Justin.
- I' m Vince.
What’ s the name of your band?
- Uh, the Kinky Wizards.
- Nice.
What’ s the name of your label?
Top Five Records.
You said yourself those guys were good.
Nirvana?
Pop Abrams and the Smurfs?
You wouldn’ t be familiar with our immediate influences.
- They’ re mostly German.
- Kraftwerk?
Falco?
Hasselhoff?
Hey.
You called?
- Laura, are you all right?
- My dad --
- What’ s up?
- Laura’ s dad died.
I' m sorry, Rob.
A Laura’ s dad tribute list.
Okay?
Okay.
"Leader Of The Pack."
The guy fuckin ’ beefs it on his motorcycle and dies, right?
Jan and Dean.
Do you know that right after they recorded that song, Jan himself, um, crashed his --
- It was Dean, you fuckin ’ idiot. - it was Jan.
- It was a long time after the song -- - Okay, whatever.
Laura’ s mom could sing it.
"One Step Beyond" by Madness.
No, no, no, no, no.
Wh- When are you going home?
In a minute, when I get it together.
And, uh, "You Can’ t Always Get What You Want."
No, immediate disqualification because of its involvement with The Big Chill.
Oh, God, you’ re right.
Um, Mom wants you to come to the funeral.
Me?
- Yeah, ’ cause my dad really liked you, and...
Mom never told him we’ d split, because he wasn’ t up to it.
"Wreck Of The Edmund Fitzgerald."
Uh, Gordon Lightfoot.
Bastard.
That’ s so good.
Do you, uh -- Do you want me there?
- Is Ray going?
- No!
Sha- na- na, na- na- na na- na- na- na- na
Brother, what a night it really was
Glory be
Brother, what a night Angina’ s tough --
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done...
- Bless this day -- - "Many Rivers To Cross" by Jimmy Cliff.
"Angel" by Aretha Franklin... and I’ ve always had this fantasy that some beautiful, tearful woman will insist on...
"You’ re The Best Thing That Ever Happened To Me" by Gladys Knight.
- But who would that woman be?
- Hey, Jo.
- Hey.
- How are you doing?
- I' m all right, I suppose.
But Laura -- I don’ t know.
Yeah, well, she’ s had a rough time of it already without this.
It’ s just so hard when you put all of your efforts into one area of your life... and it doesn’ t work out.
Really.
It’ s no problem.
- Oh.
- Oh?
Don’ t fuckin ’ say "oh" like that to me, Liz.
I' m really sorry, Jo.
Look, I can either stick up for myself... or I can believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself.
Huh?
- I mean -- - Do you think this is really the time to be talking about --
I think just the once would do!
- I' m very sorry, Laura.
- Thanks for coming.
Laura, I' m sorry.
I' m clear- focused allaround
I can keep both feet on the ground
I can follow the path
I can handle whatever
- Most of the time
I always had one foot out the door... and that prevented me from doing a lot of things...
- I guess it made more sense to commit to nothing.
- Most of the time
- Keep my options open.
- It’ s well understood
- And that’ s suicide.
- By tiny, tiny increments.
- I wouldn’ t change it if I could
I can make it all match up
I can hold my own
Right down to the bone
Hell, I don’ t even think
Are you gonna lie in that flower bed all night?
- You’ re soaking.
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
- Is there anything I can do?
- Where?
Dad used to bring us here when we were kids.
Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
‘ Cause I want to feel something else than this.
It’ s either that, or I go home and put my hand in the fire.
No.
I’ ve been saving them for later.
It’ il have to be sex then.
Right.
I knew there was a reason I wore a skirt today.
- Hi.
- Hi.
It doesn’ t seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.
I' m too tired.
I' m too tired not to be with you.
Well, so if you had a bit more energy, we’ d stay split up?
But things being as they are, with you being wiped out and all, you wanna get back together?
- Is that it?
- Yeah.
What about Ian?
Well, Ray’ s a disaster.
I, I know it’ s not very romantic, Rob.
- I just -- - So that’ s it?
Well, you’ ve made it clear you want me back, so --
Look, um, we can talk about it later if- if you want to.
Right now, I -- I just --
Okay.
And so we got back together, and it was great.
She moved all her stuff back in, all at once.
- So when exactly did you decide to get back with me exactly?
- I' m not telling you.
- See, that’ s not -- not a nice way to play at all.
That’ s not -- - The better you look
- We went out to dinner every night.
What else?
- I' m like a child with
- A brand new toy - How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye?
Marvin Gaye and Art Garfunkel make pop records.
Made.
Marvin Gaye’ s dead.
You could say it was everything I ever wanted really.
- Marvin Gaye!
"Let’ s Get It On."
That’ s our song!
Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship.
I’ d like a word with him then.
It was everything I ever wanted... except for some fuckin ’ reason... this --
Excuse me.
Yeah.
Yeah, it is.
I haven’ t heard this one.
It’ s really good.
Yeah, I know.
- Are you Bob?
- Rob.
Yeah, Rob.
You used to deejay.
I used to go to the Doubledoor to hear you spin.
You were unbelievable.
- Really?
- I' m Caroline.
- What do you do?
- I work for the Reader.
I write a music column.
You’ re Caroline Fortis?
I read your column.
- It’ s great.
- Rob, phone.
- Can you take a message?
It’ s your girlfriend.
Hey.
- Talk to your woman.
- It was her idea.
Laura!
"Dance music for old people"?
- A record release party?
What if I was doing something that can’ t be cancelled?
- Rob, what are you ever doing that can’ t be cancelled?
- That’ s not the point!
- The single cannot be done in time.
I mean, there’ s a million things!
- It’ il be done.
Oh, guess what.
Barry said his band will play a set.
Barry is playing at this thing?
Fucking, what are you -- Are you insane?
- Barry, I’ il give -- I’ il give you ten percent of the door if you don’ t play.
Rob, we’ re getting that anyway.
Twenty percent.
- No!
We need the gig.
A hundred and ten percent.
- Rob, we’ re called Sonic Death Monkey.
Yeah.
Let’ em riot.
We’ re Sonic fucking Death Monkey.
We made the CD with you.
Now your friends and your girlfriend are throwing some kind of celebration party or something... and you’ re asking us not to come to the party?
Exactly.
I don’ t know, dude.
That just seems kind of stupid.
It’ s a single.
It’ s just -- It’ s not a big deal.
It’ s just that you’ re making something.
You, the critic, the professional appreciator... put something new into the world... and the second one of those things gets sold to someone, you’ re officially a part of it.
Congratulations, Rob.
Wow.
I would -- You know, I would love to hear them.
- Why don’ t I send it over to you when it’ s, uh, done?
- Really?
- I will look forward to that.
- Sure, yeah.
Okay.
What are your all- time top five favorite records?
In a club or at home?
Listen.
I’ il tell you what.
Why don’ t I just make you a tape?
Many do’ s and don’ ts.
First of all, you’ re using someone else’ s poetry to express how you feel.
So, for this one, I' m thinking --
I' m thinking --
When is this gonna stop?
When’ s what gonna stop?
Uh, nothin ’.
Who’ s the tape for?
Just some girl who interviewed me for the Reader.
So what am I gonna do now?
Just keep jumping from rock to rock... for the rest of my life until there aren’ t any rocks left?
Should I bolt every time I get that feeling in my gut when I meet someone new?
I’ ve been thinking with my gut since I was 1 4 years old... and, frankly speaking, I’ ve come to the conclusion that my guts have shit for brains.
A drinking lunch on a school day.
That’ s a nice surprise.
- Are you nervous about tomorrow night?
- Not really, no.
- No, no, I' m gonna talk to you.
- Great.
What are you gonna talk to me about?
Um, I’ m gonna talk to you about whether or not... you want to get married to me.
- I’ m serious.
- Yes, I know.
Well, thanks a fucking bunch.
I’ m sorry, but two days ago you were making tapes...
- for that girl from The Reader.
- Yeah.
Well, forgive me if I don’ t think of you as the world’ s safest bet.
Would you marry me if I was?
- I don’ t know.
- I’ m just sick of thinking about it all the time.
This stuff.
Love and settling down and marriage, you know?
I changed my mind.
I will.
I’ m trying to explain, okay?
That other girl, or other women, whatever --
You know?
And they always seem really great... because there’ s never any problems.
And if there are, they’ re cute problems like... you know, we bought each other the same Christmas present... or she wants to go see a movie that I’ ve already seen, you know?
And then I come home, and you and I have real problems... and you don’ t even want to see the movie I want to see, period.
- There’ s no lingerie and -- - I have lingerie.
Yes, you do.
You have great lingerie, but you also have the cotton underwear... that’ s been washed a thousand times, and it’ s hanging on the thing and --
A- And they have it too.
It’ s just I don’ t have to see it because it’ s not in the fantasy.
Do you understand?
And there are never really any surprises, and it never really --
- Delivers?
- Delivers.
Right.
And I' m tired of it.
And I’ m tired of everything else, for that matter.
But I don’ t ever seem to get tired of you.
So --
But were you really expecting me to say yes?
I don’ t know.
Well, you’ ve asked.
Thank you.
- Uh, thanks for coming out here tonight.
That was just a little bit of "I Sold My Mom’ s Wheelchair..." the title track from the album of same name... the record we’ re having this record release party for.
The two burgeoning criminals behind this opus are standing by the bar.
They’ re underage, and we’ il lose our liquor license --
But we’ il get to them in a moment.
First, I have to introduce a band, so please don’ t leave... until after they finish and we play the record.
Right now, it’ s my great, great pleasure... to introduce Sonic Death Monkey.
I should’ ve played the whole album first.
- These people are gonna burn the place down.
- No, no, it’ s gonna be fine.
- It’ s gonna be fine.
Watch.
- Thank you.
Rob, thank you for the enthusiastic intro... but we’ re no longer called Sonic Death Monkey.
Uh, we’ re on the verge of being called, uh, Kathleen Turner Overdrive.
However, this evening we will be Barry Jive... and the Uptown Five.
Let’ s get it on
With so much to give
Since we got to be
I love you
- Life can be - The making of a great compilation tape...
like breaking up, is hard to do and takes ages longer than it might seem.
- For the first time, I can sort of see how that’ s done.
We will share

Very good.
Proceed.
Well...... I slipped...... on a thermal transfer this morning.
It' s never happened before.
I wasn' t concentrating enough.
Yes, I understand.
-... going well.
- Yes, fine.
How could I be so wrong?
My mate...... has been acting very strange.
I can' t explain it.
- Yes.
- I haven' t been feeling very well myself.
- Yes, I understand.
- I don' t know, maybe it' s me.
Yes, fine.
I needed some pinural last night.
- I feel as if something...
- Excellent.... odd were happening to me.
- Something that...
- Yes? -... I can' t understand.
- Could you be more...... specific?
The sedatives.
I' m taking etracene, but it doesn' t seem strong enough.
I have a hard time concentrating.
You are a true believer.
Blessings of the state.
- Please, forgive me.
- Blessings of the masses.
Thou art a subject of the divine, created in the image of man...... by the masses, for the masses.
Let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill.
Work hard.
Increase production.
Prevent accidents.
And...... be happy.
If it will make you happy, just this once.
Now, be careful, it 's heavy.

THX?
Is that you?
We are sorry, but we must deny your request.
Birthborns are not allowed more than 5 units of enerval.
Substitution of enerval for etracene...... may cause a serious chemical imbalance.

Never.

Five felons were caught fleeing rehabilitation center DD2.
All five have been undergoing treatment for drug offenses.
- Where did you get this car?
- I was just issued it.
I took it for a test drive and ran straight through a crowd at the dispersal center.
Terrible.
No.
Because I didn 't hit anyone, just an 1 1 14.
What' s this?
- You' ve seen enough.
- Well, that' s wonderful.
- You know I don' t feel well.
- Take your sedation.
- That is terrible, just terrible.
No, it was wonderful, wonderful.
Because my hand, it was paralyzed anyway.
That was very funny.
Remember, an enerval overdose may cause a serious chemical imbalance.
My time is yours.
Go ahead.
What 's wrong with me?
Nothing.
- Yes, fine.
- She 's an ordinary roommate.
I share rooms with her.
- Our relationship is normal, conforming.
We share nothing...... but space.
What is she doing to me?
Yes, I understand.
I think I' m dying.
Could you be more...... specific?
You are a true believer.
Blessings of the state.
Blessings of the masses.

I was so afraid.
So alone.
I wanted to touch you...... so many times.
I was happy.
Why get me involved?
They know.
I can feel it.
No one knows.
They' re watching us now.
No one can see us.
I can...... feel it.
Twenty- four.
Twenty- two.
6442, gate five, please.
We' ve got a malfunctioning officer in corridor 7A.
All right, just a minute.
Standby, scope 1.
If you go back on sedation, you won' t feel the same way about me.
You' il report me for drug violation.
I' ve got a slip movement to install on my next shift.
I' il never make it the way I am now.
- You don' t -- - I know I wouldn' t.
I know you can.
- Then what?
It can' t go on forever, you know it can' t.
And live in the superstructure.
You only have one more shift left, don' t you?
We could be gone before the next series started.
- It' s all right.
- Standing by.
What' s this?
I have to see SEN.
I' ve just been given a shift change.
- When?
- Now.
- He wants me to come to his quarters.
A shift change should come through scheduling.
Why should he want to see you?
I don' t know.
- Don' t go.
- I have to.
He' s a G34.
You don' t have to.
I don' t trust him.
You ought to file a report.
No.
Don' t make trouble.
It' s nothing.
Then why did you bring it up?
I didn' t.
You asked me about the card.
You' re going to get us into trouble.
Do not push or shove at the fountain.
It' s more work for the cleaning detail.
- Did you copy that?
- The android, the hung- over writing.
Is he copying me?
This is borough- flow submaster.
Control, have you got that code yet?
I read you very badly.
I' il check the message....
- lt 's you.
Sit down.
You know, this is really odd.
I was just thinking about you.
I must apologize for all this chaos.
They moved in this morning...... and it' s been going on all day.
The roommate was destroyed, you know.
Terrible inconvenience.
Have to try to see things in perspective, do what you can...... to make things...... fit.
I can accept things up to a point.
But if you get a chance...... to make...... adjustments...... you' re very foolish to pass them up.
Where is LUH?
- What?
- Your card, please.
Thank you.
This monitor is to be used for emergencies or special requests only.
All routine information can easily be obtained...... through the bulletin panels installed at --
Why did you have LUH come here?
Why are you so concerned?
What' s going on?
I want you for my roommate.
We' il be very good for one another.
I don' t understand.
Living selection is computed.
I know what you' re thinking.
Program- shifting isn' t that major a crime, is it?
You' re in violation.
Don' t say that.
What have you done to LUH?
She was here.
We...... had a long talk.
And she agreed that it would be better for both of you to switch.
She seemed to think that you weren' t accurately mated with her in the first place.
I' il never have another mate like ONA.
You rate very high in sanitation.
I' ve checked.
I don' t feel well.
We' il be happy.
Combined with the economic advantages of the mating structure...... it far surpasses any disadvantages in increased perversions.
An infinite translated mathematics of tolerance and charity...... among artificial memory devices is ultimately binary.
Stimulating rhetoric.
LUH?
Absolute.
The theater of noise is proof of our potential.
The circulation of prototypes.
The golden talisman underfoot is phenomenon approaching.
And in the history of now...... all ethos are designed.
You 're not cleared for this area.
I can program myself for any area, almost.
I' il report you.
Listen, no need to be distressed with me.
- Get out of here, leave me alone.
I programmed her to area 5450.
The transfer should come through by the next series.
You' re gonna need a new roommate.

Drug evasion, malicious sexual perversion and transgression.
Immediate destruction on the basis of an ECO- TRX 31 4...... incurable chemical imbalance with socially deteriorating conscience.
Reject.
Inefficient, unwarranted destruction.
- Must be saved -- - He' s allowed erotics to exist --
What is the prosecution doing?
- But there can be no doubt --
- Records show he is of clinic origin.
- Remotely subject to alteration.
If society is to free itself of these deviants --
- This is not a race issue.
- He must be destroyed.
We must not continue to consume these erotics.
We must exterminate the source of sin.
Economics must not dictate situations which are obviously religious.
Masses won.
Defendant used, not destroyed.

Can I borrow one of your etracenes?
Sure.

You said 45 on the --
All right.
Should we zoom this a little here?
Here, I' il just zoom it.
Hey, doesn' t it zoom like --?
Now, what have you been checked out on over at level 387?
Well, at 387, our system was never completed.
We' d use --
Never --
No, but with the Mark 7, you had the same --
You could just open them up as if -- Open all four up.
You ought to be careful about the....
You got any polarity here on the mobile travel?

- I just punched up one and I' m opening --

That' s it.
Okay, now watch that reading.

Watch -- - This -- This knob is loose.
Wait, which switch gets it out?

Oh, yeah?
Are you all right?
What did they do to you?
What?
I' m going to have a child.
Hold me.

THX 1 1 38.
Hi.
I know you turned me in.
I' m doing quite well here anyway.
I' m setting some things up...... but it isn' t easy.
A very difficult balance, you know?
Now, let' s get something straight right from the start.
It' s gonna take you some time to see my overall plan.
So until then, stay out of things you don' t understand, right?
You' re gonna be making things more difficult for me.
It' s the least you can do.
What' s wrong with you?
- Don' t be like that.
- It' s all right.
You' re safe now.
When posterity judges our actions here...... it will perhaps see us not as unwilling prisoners...... but as men who, for whatever reason...... preferred to remain as non- contributing individuals on the edge of society.
- We must not let this happen.
- Countless diversions.
- Reciting where we are.
- Arguing about leaving.
- Predicting the future.
- We must choose a leader...
- What about keeping things livable here? -... to unite us.
- LUH 9998.
- LUH?
What happened?
Who' s gone?
- JOT.
- My friend, your point of view....
Yes, CAM, that' s it.
Your point is well taken, CAM...... but it lacks the balance that a broader and deeper range of experience can lend it.
When I first arrived here, I saw things as perhaps you do now.
Yes, I was confused about my predicament.
I longed to thrash out, to tear down, to destroy and annihilate...... to ravage, wreak havoc and plunder.
Being basically levelheaded, however...... I realized that my first goal should be to study this place...... where what seemed blind circumstance had placed me.
Listen to the mumblings of an old man...... and bank those flames with earnest inquiry and honest observation.
"Mumblings."
"Mumblings," you hear?
Know how many times we' ve listened to that speech?
Do you know how many times we' ve had to listen to that speech?
Know what you are?
If we thought like you --
You know what I want?
I want one idea.
One idea could get us out of here!
We' il just have to be sure it' s the right idea.
We' il know it when we see it.
I' il know it when I see it!
Clear and straightforward and plain as the nose on your face.
Talked to oneself over....
-- believed he was going to a place where he' d be happy.
And in so believing, he created a veritable paradise for himself right here.
Unfortunately, not all of us can have the positive conviction of LOO.
But, thankfully, not all of us are burdened with the ominous forebodings of SEN.
I, myself --
Now, that' s what I mean by the wrong idea.
Look, I' m not going to try to prove the usefulness of history.
It is genuinely too obvious to need proof.
I want to help you.
You can help me.
Here.
Take a biscuit.
You understand, we' re all in this together.
You want to leave.
You' re not like them.
I' il see to it that we all get out of here.
Take it easy!
Look at them.
It' s pitiful.
My things.
You' re with me.
I know.
I have a contract.
All it says is:
We' re all in this together.
We must convince the others.
Later, then.
We need a new unity.
And not a unity which discourages dissent.
We need dissent, but we need a creative dissent.
Our voices are not raised in any harmonious chorus...... but our differences are differences of emphasis rather than of fundamentals.
- Tomorrow, as we -- - Nondescript 6431 399.
- What is it?
Quite unique.
There have been two here before, and they smell.
What do you know?
Come here, my friend.
Let me touch you.
What' d he just do?
What' s wrong, huh?
Your lunch is dirty.
What a waste.
Here, we can save some of it.
It' s all right.
Everything' s fine.
What?
Well, if you didn' t want it, why' d you take it?
I thought this was all settled.
- Where you going?
- I' m leaving.
Leaving what?
You can' t leave.
Hey, wait.
Oh, I know, the smell.
Yeah, it' s terrible.
It' s a little bit....
Hey, you can' t -- You can' t leave without....
Just a minute.
Just wait there a minute.
After long deliberation, I have decided to go out...... and personally examine the barrier...... to learn firsthand what difficulties are involved...... and decide how to overcome them.
I recognize an element of risk...... but moments such as these require that a choice be made and action taken...... regardless of the danger.
We' il be back soon...... but we' il be gone long enough to form an accurate and functional escape.
And I shall have an honest idea how best to organize us into a working unit.
- The new alignment.
- lncredible.
Wait.
Hey, wait for me.
Show them who the leaders are.
When we get back, they' il be right there, right in the palm of my hand.
There' s no question.
Even old PTO would be with us...... if he' d still been advised.
How far before they can' t see us anymore, huh?
Maybe we better sit down right here.
Hey, rest for a while.
I can' t see them anymore.
You' re going after LUH, aren' t you?
Why, it' s ridiculous.
Going after....
Oh, wait, I knew there was something I had to tell you.
The new LUH?
He saw her just before he came out here.
- She' s gonna be coming out here.
Oh, very well.
Just exactly the way --
- You' re lying.
- No, I am not.
The air' s getting thinner.
Or pressure' s getting greater.
It' s the pressure.
How do you feel?
Shouldn' t be this far.
There' s no air.
I haven' t got the time.
You can stay here if you like.
I' il come with you.
What?
Look.
What?
That' s a man.
It' s a man.
He' s waving to us.
Hi.
Hello.
Where' d you guys come from?
Oh, well, it doesn' t make any difference.
I' m starving.
Do you mind?
How did you get here?
I mean, I was lost.
You' re not lost now?
Know the way out?
- That' s the way out.
- That' s the way we came.
That' s the way out.
How do you know?
Well, look.
Look more closely.
You see?
Come on.
Oh, yeah.
Nothing stopped us.
Come on.
Here' s a doorway.

Read me, synapse module?
Research into relay system must be given --
-- intercerebral process reported earlier.
How shall the new environment be programmed?
It all happened so slowly that...... most men failed to realize that anything had happened at all.
I wonder what happened to SEN.
We' il never make it through that main way.
- Who are you?
- I' m a hologram.
I' m not real.
You know, the fantasy bureau...... electrically- generated realities and all that.
I was stuck in the same circuit for too long.
The arm and leg routine, did you see that one?
I always wanted to be part of the real world.
So I left.
Hey, look.
You are engaged in an unauthorized procedure.
This --
We have a U65 on a K8.

It would be nice to have three additional officers.
- Have you seen them?
They must be somewhere in group 9.
Operation 5271.
Budget Control, we' d like a cost analysis on the THX 1 1 38 account.
Include all interest and inflation percentages.
Expenditures are 649 and rising.
- What was that?
- Must be an expressway.
This is Budget Control.
The expenditure ceiling on the THX case is 14, 000 credits.
Remember, thrifty thinkers are always under budget.
Would you like part of this?
It' s not very much.
Did you know all the insides are gone from all these people?
Halt.
Economics make it necessary to terminate any operation...... which exceeds 5 percent of its primary budget.
Expenditures are 1 000 and rising.
Things don 't seem to make sense.
Sometimes I see things get left out...... and they don 't fit.
People don' t seem to see them.
Or they don' t know what to do.
Sometimes l --
A little adjustment...... can make all the difference.
I wanna do the right thing.
I wanna go back.
I....
I can -- I can start again.
I can change.
I can -- I can help.
I just need a....
Need to rest up for a little while.
This is no place for prayer.
If you want to speak to OMM, you must go to a unichapel, you know that.
- Are you in any trouble?
- No.
I' m going now.
What' s your number and your prefix?
I' m gonna see this gets into your report.
No, I' m leaving now.
I' m sorry, I have to report all intruders.
- Where' s your identification badge?
You' re in violation.
- Please, just --
Trapped.
Trapped.
Looks like the only way out is the way we came in.
Say, do you have any more of that food?
She' s not there.
Who are you looking for?
Can you hear me?
Stay calm.
Everything will be all right.
The door seems to be jammed.
Please check the lock on your side.
Everything will be all right.
We are here to help you.
Stay calm.
We are not going to harm you.
Everything will be all right.
Well, unless that computer has made a mistake...... that 's your roommate.
No, you 're wrong.
I hope that auxiliary load holds.
I' m almost through to the upper positive plates.
Upper positive plates?
Maybe there' s something wrong with the computer.
I don' t know.
It' s a strange life.
Cybernetics, genetics, lasers and all those things.
I guess I' il never understand any of that stuff.
Guess maybe holograms are not supposed to.
THX 1 138 will be taken into custody at a minimal monetary expenditure.
6000 credits under budget.
Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Are you all right in there?

- Good sleep?
- Not bad.
So where are we?
Where you from?
San Diego.
Left yesterday.
So you came Honolulu- Guam- Pago- here?
Long trip.
What do you do?
l’ m a psychologist.
Hey, a shrink.
They’ ve called in everything else.
How do you mean?
We’ ve ferried people out of Guam for the last 2 days.
Physicists, biologists, mathematicians, you name it.
Everybody being flown to the middle of nowhere in the Pacific Ocean.
What’ s going on?
They’ re not telling us anything, sir.
What did they tell you?
There was a plane crash.
Do you get called in on crashes?
l’ m on a list of psychologists the FAA brings in when a plane goes down.
So where exactly are we now?
Over there.
Here.
Take a look.
What is that?
All that for a plane crash?
I never mentioned a plane crash.
- Any other gear?
- l’ d like to call my family.
Remain there till we send for you.
- l’ d like to get started.
- We’ il send for you.
- lt’ s critical I see them -- - Who?
The survivors. lf I don’ t get to them in the first 24 hours --
- What survivors?
- The survivors of the plane crash.
Plane crash?
I deal in post- traumatic stress and survival guilt.
Maybe I should talk to someone who knows what’ s going on here.
- Talk to the ship’ s psychiatrist.
- l’ m a psychologist.
That’ s why I was sent here.
I told you people I need a phone.
Discuss that with Mr. Barnes.
That’ s fine.
Give me a phone, l’ il call him.
Why are you here?
Take your hands off me, please.
Do you have any idea who I am?
Tell him the name of the book you wrote.
It was a Book- of- the- Month Club Main Selection.
Never heard of it.
You really thought he read your book.
You haven’ t changed.
It was written for the layman.
He’ s not impressed.
ls there a phone in here?
- l’ ve been trying to call my wife.
- Would you stop touching me?
Wait a minute.
Beth?
All units make your flight quarters...... condition one stations for landing.
Stay clear of the fantail --
Goodman, you been here long?
- l’ ve been here 3 hours.
- Welcome aboard.
This thing scares the hell out of me.
lt’ s already too late.
You might as well helicopter me back...... because the damage is done to the survivors already.
We’ il get to that.
- I don’ t even know who you are.
I know who you are.
Military?
You ever hear of the OSSA?
They don’ t know who I am.
That should reassure you.
You haven’ t talked to anyone about this?
- I talked to the helicopter pilot.
- What’ d you tell him?
That’ s my job.
Good.
There was no plane crash.
Spacecraft.
I guess that explains a lot.
- NASA?
- That doesn’ t surprise you?
At least it explains the secrecy.
You made that explicit in your report.
What report?
ULF.
I wrote that for the Bush administration.
And that’ s our bible here.
But that was a report about a possible encounter with an alien being.
You want to come with me?
Oh, boy.
Cut this cable here clean as a shears.
The Navy got interested, sent out a search ship.
It turned out that what did it...... was this.
We took this with side- looking sonar.
This is an aerodynamic fin longer than a football field...... bigger than any known wingspan.
This is the fuselage.
Came in a week ago.
There it is, buried under about 8 yards of coral.
Something’ s wrong with that measurement.
You can set your watch by it.
That’ s right.
1709.
So you’ re saying this spacecraft crashed 300 years ago?
288.
That’ s impossible.
lt’ s not impossible if this spacecraft came from an alien civilization.
Wait a minute.
You think this is an alien spacecraft?
lt’ s not impossible.
lt’ s ridiculous.
We think there’ s an Unknown Life Form on the spacecraft.
That’ s why you’ re here.
You are the contact team that was recommended in the Goodman Report.
We have a biochemist...... to assess the physiology of the Unknown Life Form.
A mathematician, because that’ il probably be our common language.
And we have an astrophysicist to locate its place in the cosmos.
- Led by a psychologist.
- Right.
Nowadays, the little green men say, ’ ’ Take me to your therapist ’ ’?
Listen up.
’ ’ Contact teams meeting an Unknown Life Form or ULF...... must be prepared for severe psychological impact.
Stress reaction of confronting such life has not been sufficiently studied...... and cannot be entirely predicted in advance.
But the most likely consequence of contact is...... absolute terror. ’ ’
That’ s from Norman’ s report.
l’ m sorry, are these parameters correct?
You’ re saying that you have a spacecraft over a half a mile long...... that crashed into the ocean 300 years ago and it’ s completely intact?
That’ s right.
And the kicker is, our sonar is picking up a low- level hum.
Something’ s still running inside.
There’ s no way this coral could’ ve grown faster than an inch a year?
That’ s what we’ re going there to see.
Who says?
Harry, that’ s a joke, right?
Bigger!
The idea that we’ re not alone, it’ il change everything.
You don’ t want to see that?
I got to say that I resent this briefing very much.
And how’ s that?
lf Norman’ s report calls for a biologist, a mathematician...... an astrophysicist and a psychologist...... why are you here?
Physical protocols start in a half an hour.
You always wear glasses?
I just started wearing these.
Are the glasses a problem?
I don’ t actually need them.
They’ re just for reading.
I see fine without them.
But they didn’ t anticipate l’ d be going 1, 000 feet under the water.
Do you take prescription medication?
No.
None at all?
Once in a while sometimes I might take like a...... a piece of Xanax or something if l’ m nervous.
Something like that.
But not...... much.
Complete reconstruction of ACL, right knee.
Still have steel pin here, steel pin here, little medial collateral damage.
I see that you have a scar on your neck.
Car accident.
- Were you drinking?
But I wasn’ t driving.
Wait, I just want to apologize for putting your name on the list.
Why?
When I made the report a few years ago, I picked names of people I knew.
And?
I know Ted because of his father.
- Yeah, so what?
- Beth was a patient.
lt’ s a bogus report.
What?
Did you tell Barnes?
That’ s fraud.
Political agenda.
They said, in case of an alien invasion, do’ s and don’ ts.
Why didn’ t you just say no?
$35, 000.
It paid the down payment on my house.
New administration wanted to prove they’ re doing something new.
How’ d you come up with this team...... of a biologist, an astrophysicist and a mathematician?
Right.
- How?
- I don’ t know.
Made them come to me.
I forgive you!
He’ s a pain in the ass.
l’ il talk to him.
We’ il be there 2 hours.
You don’ t have to be around him.
He idolizes you anyways, but l’ il talk to him. l’ il buy you dinner.
- l’ m sorry.
Come on.
Like a dream.
Have you called your wife?
Why not?
This’ il be a saturation dive.
You’ il be going to a habitat in 1, 000 feet of water.
A sub will take you to the Habitat and you’ il transfer aboard.
At 1, 000 feet, your body will be pressurized for that depth.
Although I wouldn’ t recommend it because the water’ s so cold...... you’ d freeze to death in less than 2 minutes.
That’ s the reason for the diving suits.
Your helmet has a rebreather for your air supply.
Following this briefing, l’ il take you to an onboard dive tank.
For the next 8 hours...... you’ il train in deep- saturation dive techniques and emergency procedures.
Once you’ ve gone down 1, 000 feet...... if you surface, you’ il have to commit to several days of decompression.
There is no real quick return.
Without decompression, your body would literally burst.
The dive has been planned well and professionally monitored.
The descent will take about 13 minutes, descending at 80 feet a minute.
lt’ s going to get chilly.
Try to relax.
Next time, just tell us when you’ re going to push the button.
Mozart...... Horn Concerto in E- flat...... K- 447.
How you holding up, Captain Nautical?
- l’ m loose.
- You’ re loose?
l’ m loose. l’ m loose.
l’ m uptight.
- We okay?
- We’ re in the river now.
What river?
lt’ s a temperature/ salinity differential.
It flows like a river inside the ocean.
- Under the ocean and there’ s a river.
- That’ s right.
You okay?
Right now, l’ m not okay.
Would you please not touch me?
We’ re both nervous.
Would you cut that out, please?
That’ s Harry’ s stress reaction.
Those noises we’ re hearing, that’ s normal?
Those noises are the water pressure attacking the sub’ s integrity.
You know a little something about that, don’ t you, Norman?
Come on, you be nice this trip.
Were you nice last time?
You two want to sit together?
My God!
Norman, look at this, look at this.
That’ s just the fin.
That’ s the Habitat.
The Navy moved it in sections and set it up as a base...... as soon as the spaceship was discovered.
It' s manned by 2 naval personnel.
It will be your home- away- from- home while we investigate the spacecraft.
It ain’ t the Motel 6.
Approaching docking bay from R- 4.
All personnel, descent sub one engaging lock area.
You are now depressurized.
We’ re going to pressurize you now.
lt’ s hot in there, but you’ re going to feel coolness.
That’ s the helium.
- Was I the only one paying attention?
Oxygen is a corrosive gas, in the same family as fluorine and chlorine...... hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid.
That’ s why we’ re breathing helium.
Because oxygen at any level higher than 2. 3 becomes toxic.
Can you run that by me again, Ted?
I don’ t speak balloon.
What?
The helium resonates differently with my vocal chords. ’ ’ Follow the yellow brick road. ’ ’
Kiddies, cut it out.
Put them on.
We’ il use that to open its door.
ls that the door?
Yeah, we used sonar imaging to pinpoint it before the divers went down.
- How tall is that robot?
- Five feet.
And it’ s roughly the same size as an airplane door, isn’ t it?
- Excuse me, Ted.
- I think that’ s worth taking note of.
Tell them our team is in place and ready, okay?
This is Habitat to Navy dive.
Has it occurred to anyone maybe we shouldn’ t open that door?
Why do you say that?
We assume they’ il be green...... or insect- like, but basically human.
But what if they inhale air and exhale cyanide gas? lt’ s plausible.
Or live forever, like a virus or a yeast.
But why would you assume that a ULF would want to kill us?
An immortal creature wouldn’ t think killing was right or wrong.
lt’ d have no concept of it.
lnstant eradication. lt’ s what all the serious scientific stuff talks about.
What little there is on the subject.
You did put that in your report?
lt’ s in there.
Get us the ETD for team’ s departure to surface.
Tell them we’ re in ready and thank them.
Habitat to Navy Dive.
Our team’ s ready to take over.
Descent sub ready for your return to surface.
We’ il let you know what we find.
l’ m not too thrilled at the prospect of this.
What if you have to go to the bathroom?
Just go down your leg, Ted.
Really?
You can urinate in these?
You can.
The question is, do you want to?
Where’ s the switch?
Okay, let’ s go.
All right, Fletcher...... we’ re at 1, 022 feet.
The ambient temperature, 34 degrees.
Heading out north- northwest...... 330.
lt’ s a firm bottom.
lntermittent coral.
This is great, you guys.
Look at the size of that thing!
My God!
You see that tunnel?
That’ s where we’ re going.
lnto the heart of darkness.
We’ re in the coral pipe now, Fletcher, approaching the air lock.
l’ m feeling pressure in my ears.
ls that normal?
Just use your equalizer.
A little better.
The most toxic creatures on Earth live down here.
The venom of the land animal is nothing by comparison.
Even the weakest sea snake is invariably lethal.
ls that supposed to make me feel good, Beth?
This is our air lock.
lt’ il take us from a wet to a dry environment.
We’ re assuming the inside of the ship is sealed.
This thing is enormous.
That' s not budging, is it?
- Turn it at 45 degrees.
- What’ s happening here?
Maybe it’ s the hydraulics.
The pressure messes everything up at this depth.
Time for a demonstration in basic physics, gentlemen.
What is it, Harry?
Take a look.
lt’ s chipped.
So what?
l thought you said this thing wasn’ t damaged when it crashed...... that this titanium alloy was so super- strong, you can’ t hurt it.
I did.
So why does it chip when this scientist just bangs it with a hammer?
ls there heat coming off this thing?
You’ re right.
Back up.
Just a minute.
Get back.
Jesus.
Anybody else wonder who the hell opened that door?
How did that happen?
l’ m not sure about the atmosphere.
Helmets stay on.
All right.
We come in peace.
Always wanted to say that.
Fletcher, inform the Navy we’ ve gained access...... to the spacecraft.
There' s a hell of a lot of radiation shielding in here.
Huge grids of catwalks and plumbing...
... and a lot of steam.
lt’ s endless.
We’ il stay in touch here.
Somebody’ s been here.
There’ s footsteps and they ain’ t ours.
Time to turn back?
l’ m a little curious.
Break up into 2 squads.
We’ il never cover the territory otherwise.
Split up?
We’ ve only got about a half- hour of breathing time left.
Ted and Harry, you come with me.
Come on.
I think the people who built this place would call that ’ ’ divide and conquer. ’ ’
Whoever built this thing wanted us dead, we’ d be dead already.
These guys offer a federal grant to study the effects of an alien invasion.
I told all this to Harry.
You made up the report?
I mean, I did research on half of it.
Who did the other half?
I borrowed from, you know, good writers.
lsaac Asimov, Rod Serling....
You know?
I show up here, half the Pacific fleet is here.
I just didn’ t know what to do.
I wanted to tell you, that’ s all.
ls this in the same category as, ’ ’ Beth, I thought you knew I was married ’ ’?
I don’ t think we have enough oxygen --
- Oh, my God.
- Did you push something?
It did it on its own.
That must be the cockpit.
Hold on.
Cross- stress bracing on the outer hulls.
Look at this stuff.
Soft and strong at the same time.
lt’ s, like, better than rubber, better than steel.
You know a lot about this stuff.
I studied aeronautical engineering at M. l. T.
lsn’ t that where you got your Ph. D.?
All 3 of them.
I hated M. l. T.
Envy?
Puberty.
How old?
First Ph. D., 18.
Damn.
You beat me by one year.
Let’ s push on.
Let’ s go.
Man, they didn’ t tell you how heavy these things were out of the water.
Look at this.
Come here.
’ ’ Trash. ’ ’
Trash?
Oh, God.
lt’ s human.
You mean humanoid.
No, Norman, I mean human.
Blunt force trauma.
You can see by the direction that the fracture runs...... that he was hit in the back of the head.
What’ s in his hand?
I don’ t know.
What is it?
’ ’ Smokehouse Almonds ’ ’?
My God, it’ s an American spaceship.
It can’ t be an American spaceship.
lt’ s 300 years old.
There weren’ t even Americans, let alone spaceships.
It can’ t be, but it is.
I mean....
Look at this. lt’ s in English.
Come here.
Okay, good.
And there.
Look at the dates!
Can’ t be.
I don’ t know which one is weirder.
’ ’ Unknown Entry Event. ’ ’ Press it.
You sure?
This is Barnes, Norman.
Yeah, I can hear you.
I can’ t explain it, but I think we’ re inside an American spaceship.
It gets better.
What the hell is it?
Go out into space and gather things like this up and bring it back.
Yeah, but back from where?
Don’ t get too excited, Ted.
Turn this thing over, it’ il probably say ’ ’ Made in Korea. ’ ’
Somehow I doubt that.
No hinges of any kind.
l’ il bet if you put a laser micrometer on this, it’ d be a perfect sphere.
Perfect to a thousandth of an inch.
That’ s a message in and of itself.
- What do you mean?
When Pope Benedict asked Giotto to prove his worth as an artist...... Giotto drew a perfect circle...... freehand.
lt’ s a powerful message.
- I know what the Zen masters would say.
- What’ s that?
’ ’ This ball wants to be caught. ’ ’
Nobody built this thing looking into their third eye.
They went to a lot of trouble and they didn’ t do it for nothing.
Something put this thing out there to get picked up and brought back here.
Have you forgotten the Trojan horse?
It could be a trap.
Don’ t you think that’ s a little paranoid?
No, l’ m going to put a video camera on this thing and keep an eye on it.
Can I ask you something about this reflective surface?
Yeah, it appears to be mercury, doesn’ t it?
Except mercury’ s liquid at this temperature.
That’ s not what l’ m talking about.
What worries me is that it’ s reflecting everything but us.
I hate to be the one non- scientist that picks this up, guys.
You know what I mean?
What do you think it is?
I don’ t know.
Whatever it is...
... it’ s alien.
Okay, an American spacecraft, materials, technology...... more advanced than what we know, crashes into the ocean.
Why wasn’ t it damaged?
The materials are obviously super- strong.
lf that’ s true, why did it chip when you hit it?
Better:
It didn’ t crash.
It arrived...... 300 years ago.
- From where?
- Not ’ ’ where. ’ ’ When.
So you’ re saying this thing took a wrong turn?
That’ s right.
I mean, what if the craft...... inadvertently flew into a black hole?
It arrived in our past from its present.
The dates in the flight record -- 43, 47.
That has to be 2043, 2047.
The image you saw, what you described...... sounds like a black hole, a tear in the space --
We know what a black hole is.
I don’ t know.
lt’ s a collapsed star with so much gravity it’ s like a vacuum cleaner...... sucking everything into it, light, interstellar dust, time --
- Time?
- lt’ s possible, but not plausible.
We just haven’ t been able to fly into one and prove it.
I just got off the horn topside.
They’ re expecting a bad blow up there.
And they’ re pulling us out.
Pulling us out?
What do you mean?
What part of ’ ’ pull out ’ ’ don’ t you understand?
We’ re leaving.
That’ s ridiculous.
We haven’ t even begun to scratch the surface here.
lf you’ ve ever seen a Pacific cyclone, what we call a tornado is a little fart.
So I suggest you go back to the dormitory and take a nap.
You need to lower your metabolism before we start the decompression.
You’ re leaving a time- traveling spacecraft at the bottom of the ocean?
l’ m just following my orders.
- It was made in America.
- What’ s your point?
My point is, l’ m a biochemist and there’ s no life down here.
What is wrong with you?!
That doesn’ t mean there’ s nothing to learn, to explore!
She’ s right.
You guys are the human contact team for an Unknown Life Form.
There is no Unknown Life Form, so we pull out at 0900.
- Please say something to him.
- What?
I don’ t know.
Do you not have an opinion about this?
l’ m delighted we’ re going back up top.
Let’ s go home.
Barnes is wrong, you know.
You mean, wrong about the storm?
No, about the Sphere.
What about the Sphere?
lt’ s alive.
Why do you say that?
There’ s something inside it.
How can there be anything inside it?
There’ s no door, no seams.
The Sphere chooses what it will and won’ t reflect.
Doesn’ t that seem like the actions of a conscious being to you?
Pop psychology.
I think, for whatever it’ s worth, you’ re angry...... towards our friend Ted in there...... because he figured this out before you did.
You really think so?
This is my first underwater session.
You’ re right.
Ted did figure it out first, didn’ t he?
Good shrinkage.
We’ re all going to die down here, you know.
What?
You see, it’ s curious.
Time travel.
And when we get back, we’ re going to tell everyone...... how it’ s possible, how it’ s done, what the dangers are.
But why 50 years in the future, when the spacecraft encounters a black hole...... does the computer call it an ’ ’ Unknown Entry Event ’ ’?
Why don’ t they know?
And if we never told anyone...... it means we never made it back.
Hence...... we die down here.
Just as a matter of deductive logic, Norman.
Damn, I wish I could get inside that Sphere.
- What’ s wrong?
- Talk to Mr. Barnes.
- Where is he?
- Video feed room.
I don’ t know where the hell anything is.
Where am l?
What’ s going on?
You tell me.
- What the hell is he doing?
- I don’ t know.
Do you know what he’ s doing?
- I need to know what you know.
- Nothing.
He wanted to go inside.
We are inside.
You mean outside?
- He said, ’ ’ inside. ’ ’ - What? lnside the spacecraft?
I think inside the Sphere.
Holy shit!
My God.
Did he go inside?
- I don’ t think so.
- What the hell’ s going on?
He didn’ t just disappear.
I think it’ s a glitch in the video.
Give me playback on that.
You’ il have it in a minute.
You knew he was doing this and you said nothing.
- You didn’ t think!
- I didn’ t think it possible.
Where are Beth and Ted?
I don’ t know.
I' m not getting an image on the sub.
Impossible!
I got a cable in my quarters!
They’ il be here in 25 minutes or less!
The only logical explanation is that the sub is still at the surface.
ls it also logically possible your sonar is messed up?!
Let’ s just calm down, all right?
He didn’ t just disappear.
We are not going to leave him.
You got that right.
I am not going to lose a civilian on my watch.
You have just screwed up our trip to the surface.
We are not going up to the surface.
Harry!
We are not going up!
Harry!
Can you hear me?
Harry, can you hear me?
Norman, this is not a triage situation.
Go find me Ted and Beth.
Norman, stop.
Still no reading on the sub.
Forget the goddamn sonar, Teeny.
All right?
What the hell?
Can you hear me?
ls he alive?
We have a problem.
Harry’ s out cold.
His pulse is normal.
All his vitals are normal...... but I don’ t get it.
Norman, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
- That tears it.
- What, sir?
We’ re on internal power.
I don 't follow you.
For some reason the sub turned back.
Break out your 5- day deodorant pads.
We' re here for the duration.
Everything’ s normal.
ls he all right?
Did he go inside?
What did he say?
He’ s aphasic.
He’ s asleep, Ted.
I can’ t believe he went inside.
He didn’ t say anything?
There’ s no door, no entry.
How did he get in?
Can I have your attention, please?
We' ve lost contact with the surface.
The Habitat is now operating solely under internal power.
We have plenty of food, oxygen and fresh water...... to sustain us until the storm is over...... and we reestablish contact with the surface.
But until that time, this mission is subject...... to emergency authority under my command.
l’ m taking this out to the mini- sub.
- Are you up on the duty roster?
- Yes, sir.
Where’ s she going?
Everything in the Habitat is videoed.
Every 1 2 hours we take the videos to the mini- sub and press the reset button.
The idea is, if something happens to us and we don’ t reset it...... the sub goes to the surface automatically.
lf we’ re all dead, they at least have a partial record of what went wrong.
Cheerful thought, huh?
Mind the store a minute.
l’ m going to the head.
What the hell’ s that?
lt’ s so tranquil.
This is beautiful.
lt’ s hard to believe we have a typhoon 1, 000 feet above our heads.
Hey, it' s snowing down here.
There' s got to be a million...... jellyfish down here.
Man, this is really beautiful.
These jellyfish are getting a little friendly.
Having a hard time seeing.
Hey, guys, you getting this?
It' s getting thick down here.
I can 't see what I' m doing.
They’ re sticking to my faceplate.
Fletcher, this is Dr. Fielding.
They’ re harmless.
Guys, these jellyfish are everywhere.
Fletcher, get out of there.
What are jellyfish doing at 1, 000 feet?
I think they feel the heat from my body.
I can’ t get them off me!
They’ re stinging through my suit!
Get back to the Habitat on the double.
I can’ t move my legs!
Come back to the Habitat.
They’ re inside my suit!
Just keep moving!
Help me!
There' s no bubbles.
Edmunds.
Yes, sir?
Come on down here.
Something...... happened to Fletcher.
When I was 5 years old I went out on a boat with my father.
He told me not to jump in the water, so of course I did and....
I jumped right into a school of these guys.
Not this big, though.
l think every one had a shot at me.
I don’ t know what this lady felt...... but, man, it went beyond pain.
l’ ve been...
... afraid of them since.
Would you feel any better if I told you this wasn’ t exactly a jellyfish?
You mean...?
I mean, jellyfish like this are unheard of.
I don’ t know what this is, but it isn’ t God’ s creation.
You can come in.
You want some coffee?
- No, thanks.
- How well do you know Dr. Halperin?
She came for her master’ s.
Don’ t take it personally, but I assume she wasn’ t a romantic interest.
Don’ t take what personally?
She’ s a tall, vibrant, younger woman.
What’ s your point?
You knew her as a patient.
l’ m not at liberty to discuss that.
I understand an exotic- gas environment 1, 000 feet under water...... with no lifeline to the surface...... is about the most dangerous environment on the planet.
lf there’ s a problem, I got to know about it.
- Beth is fine. - ’ ’ Beth is fine. ’ ’
- She’ s very fine.
Would you like to read this and tell me what it says?
- Are these my actual notes?
- What does it say?
- How in the world did you get -- - Does it say ’ ’ suicide attempt ’ ’? ’ ’ Electroshock therapy ’ ’?
lsn’ t that what it says?
What’ s your point?
Didn’ t it seem important enough to tell somebody?
You were willing to jeopardize these people’ s lives...... to have someone here who could be mentally unstable?
Are you aware of the term, ’ ’ overreact ’ ’?
We’ re 160 fathoms down.
And we’ ve got a nutbag down here who can flip out and crack up.
You selected the team.
Why didn’ t you tell me?
When I wrote this, I didn’ t know the team would be 1, 000 -- 1, 000 or 10, it makes no difference!
Why didn’ t you tell me about Beth?
It wasn’ t pertinent.
That was not your call to make!
It was a passive attempt.
A passive attempt?!
Help me. ’ ’
She took 20 yellows, and you’ re telling me she’ s perfect.
Come in.
He’ s awake?
He’ s really awake.
Man, oh, man!
You’ re going to have a problem with me.
lf my good buddy Norman keeps cooking like this, I ain’ t going nowhere.
This toast is good.
Better.
These eggs are fantastic!
Norman, what did you put in these eggs?
No, no, wait.
Don’ t tell me.
Tarragon and....
What is that?
ls that chervil?
Yes, it is.
l’ m glad you like it, Harry.
I love eggs!
They sure seem to cheer you up.
Do you remember what happened?
I went inside.
How did you get inside?
There are doors all over this place and we can’ t get out.
You didn’ t answer my question.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Harry, are you saying we shouldn’ t still be here?
I thought she did all the cooking.
She had an unfortunate accident, Harry.
She was killed.
Killed?
How?
Jellyfish.
Jellyfish?
That’ s strange.
Yes, it is strange, isn’ t it?
Here you go, Harry.
Look at that.
- lt’ s not onion rings.
Good, though.
Guess what it is.
Calamari!
- No, you’ re doing it wrong.
- I know what l’ m doing.
Bring it up.
Come on, bring it up.
He’ s trying to talk.
He wants to say something!
- See?
I hate squid.
I hate squid.
l’ m sorry.
I was trying to help.
You okay?
Harry, let me ask you something.
Before you went in the Sphere, you were convinced we would die here.
Yeah, I remember that.
You still believe it?
You afraid of dying, Norman?
He’ s hiding something and you know it.
He went inside the Sphere and whatever it is he saw, he won’ t tell us.
- He said he doesn’ t remember anything.
- You bought that?
The whole food thing was all a diversion.
The guy’ s willing to put all of our lives on the line...... because he doesn’ t want to share information.
He wants to win the Nobel Prize.
And you don’ t?
Norman, you’ ve known me since I was 17 years old.
I would love to be the guy who gets --
Do you know how respected --
l’ m not! l’ ve written one ’ ’ Fun With Dick and Jane ’ ’ book on physics.
I mean, Niels Bohr...... he published ’ ’ The Quantum Theory of Atomic Structure ’ ’ at 28.
Einstein, relativity, 26.
Newton, gravity, 23.
ln physics, if you haven’ t done it by 35, chances are you never will.
This doesn’ t have anything to do with your competitiveness with Harry?
Wunderkind!
I rest my case.
Mr. Barnes would like to see you.
Something’ s wrong with the computer system.
- Try purging it.
It just keeps coming back.
Discharge from the buffer memory?
I ruled that out.
lt’ s probably a saturation effect.
- lf that’ s true, what are our options?
- You have to change all the chips.
lt’ s going to be a long 4 days.
- Figured that out yet?
- lt’ s a saturation effect.
I don’ t think so. lf it’ s a saturation effect, it would be random.
What do you mean?
This has a pattern.
See? lt’ s like a code.
A code from where?
How’ d you do that?
How’ d you see that?
Try binary.
Letter breaks.
You think this is coming from the Sphere?
Don’ t know.
This mission is ultra top- secret.
What you translate is for my eyes only.
lf you were it, how would you know our alphabet?
Same way it’ s configured on a keyboard.
But reflected in an orb, spherically.
A keyboard, but spherical.
Take a keyboard...... wrap it around a sphere...... then starting at the center key, G, number the letters...... spiraling out.
- You the man!
- I still got it.
I still got the juice.
Keyboard.
They let you keep those?
Here, you want them?
All we got to do now is plug in the numbers.
Friends...... in the 8, 000 years of recorded history, this is a first.
You’ re now on- line with an alien intelligence.
You got to be kidding.
You must’ ve messed up the translation.
I don’ t think so.
lf this is right, this alien sounds like an idiot.
That’ s something to consider.
They must have them.
I will admit the message is childlike, but actually it’ s quite perfect.
lt’ s short, to the point, non- threatening...... kind of the way you talk to a small child or a dog.
Look at this.
He’ s making a speech.
Ask him for his last name.
What?
I want a full name for my report.
l’ m not putting in my report I lost a crew member on a deepsat expedition...... to find an alien named Jerry.
Please! ’ ’ Jerry ’ ’?
We ought to tell him that we’ re enjoying it too.
Ask him where he’ s from.
Where are you from?
We make a journey together. ’ ’
I think Jerry’ s channeling Deepak Chopra.
A journey from where?
He’ s happy.
He’ s crafty.
What happened?
Damn, I think we lost him.
We’ re not alone.
We are definitely...... not alone.
lt’ s trying to make contact with us.
Now it’ s out, free to act.
What do you mean by that?
Free to take over our computers...... call us on the phone, come knock on the door if it wants to.
A physical presence.
What are you thinking about?
That last part where he said, ’ ’ I am happy. ’ ’
Don’ t you want Jerry to be happy?
Honestly?
What’ s on your mind?
I would be happy if Jerry had no emotions whatsoever.
Because the thing of it is, here’ s Jerry...... an emotional being, cooped up for 300 years with no one to talk to...... none of the socialization, the emotional growth...... that comes from contact with other emotional beings....
So?
What happens if Jerry gets mad?
What is that sound?
Did you hear it?
You hear that thump?
What is that sound?
Can you hear me?
Did you hear that thump?
You are a hell of a woman.
I wish I knew you in the old days.
Norman told me you were --
Norman told you what?
Let’ s put it this way, that if Jerry could read your mind...... he’ d be bored with ours.
What is that sound?
Can you hear me?
Something’ s going on.
It looks like Edmunds is up on the side of the Habitat.
I' m not getting anything on sonar, but watch yourselves out there.
Would you hit your callback buttons, please?
What’ d you tell Barnes?
About what?
About me.
You told him I took 20 Nebutol and tried to kill myself.
Didn’ t you?
He had my notes.
What do you want me to do?
Did you tell him who I called?
Oh, God.
Come in.
Did you guys find that thumping yet?
Unit 40 requesting assistance.
We have a possible 211 in progress at the Valley Trust Bank......
Boyle and Kittridge.
We have shots fired.
All units, officer needs assistance.
Boyle, north of Kittridge, at the Valley Trust Bank.
Shots have been fired.
We' re pinned by automatic gunfire.
"15- L" - "10 advise, do you need" some heavy- duty machinery...... to get the officer up?
They' ve got automatic weapons.
Nothing we have can stop them.
Be advised, there' s possibly two or three suspects inside.
Shots being fired!
Shots being fired!
Suspects heavily armed and wearing body armor.
Get more officers.
Officer down!
Officer down!
Requesting SWAT.
Code Three.
I' m killing whoever moves!
You move, I' m killing you!
What are you looking at?
What are you looking at?
SWAT' s just arrived.
- We' re 30 seconds out, boys.
- All right.
Suspects have AK- 47 s, dressed in heavy body armor.
Let' s rock 'n' roll.
This is a table.
We have four cameras over the tellers.
- Do we have a visual?
- Almost.
- We cut their phones?
- Yes, sir.
Soon as you get tapped in, let me have it.
10- David standing by, position three.
Suspect' s trying to get in the driver- side door.
Do not let them get mobile.
- He' s down.
- Goddamn it!
They got Bob!
Grab somebody!
Grab somebody and bring them up here!
- Get up.
- No.
- I said, get up!
- No!
Throw a body out there, tell them we mean business!
Street, 10- David.
Storeroom is clear.
Almost to the lobby.
Shut up!
10- David to Street.
Hold your position.
- 10- David wants us to hold.
- Goddamn it!
Goddamn it!
We hold, they die.
I guess we' re not holding.
I swear to God, I' m gonna kill somebody!
Take a headshot.
They just capped E ddie!
How the hell we gonna get out of here?
Shut up, I' m thinking!
10- David to all units, we are sending in a secure phone.
Please.
Stop whining!
I' il put a bullet in your head!
Shut up!
What are they doing?
This is Rick from the L. A. P. D. Can you hear me okay?
10- David to Street.
Hold your position.
CN T has him on the phone.
10- David to the 1- 4 corner.
Confirm that you have containment.
Roger, we' re holding on the 1- 4 corner.
10- David to all units.
Confirm that you' re holding.
- We' re holding top of stairwell.
- Shut up.
Gamble, Street, where are you?
Why aren' t you responding?
Let' s be cool.
Calm down.
I' m controlling this situation!
You understand me?
- Please.
- We need to go!
No, please.
Somebody...
Help me.
Help me.
Now!
Oh, God!
Kill that bitch and throw her out front!
Get that guy off our fence!
I said to kill that bitch and throw her out front!
I' m on TV!
Street, 10- David.
Lobby is clear.
Two suspects are neutralized.
I need an RA unit for a gunshot wound to a hostage.
You' re gonna be fine, ma' am.
Ambulance is on the way.
Got them, right?
Jimbo?
- She' il be okay?
- I' m not a doctor.
You' re gonna be fine.
Boss is gonna tear you guys a new one, huh?
Same place he did the last time, time before that.
Good luck.
I don' t care what they say.
You guys were heroes out there.
That was some cocky shit out there.
You know how to play this, right?
That woman is alive because of what we did.
Yeah, alive and suing the city for millions.
Chief says if he pays, somebody else does too...... and it sure isn' t gonna be me.
- Fuller, we get two seconds to make...
- Capt. Fuller!
Capt. Fuller, we get two seconds to make a decision.
You get two months to sit there and tear it apart.
SWAT means "Special Weapons And Tactics."
Where were your tactics out there?
Saving a woman from getting shot.
That' s where they were.
Every cop knows we did the right thing.
Sometimes doing the right thing isn' t doing the right thing.
- What the hell does that mean?
- Sergeant.
You disobeyed a direct order.
End of story.
You' re both off SWAT.
They' re two of our best officers.
I' m not sticking them in the field after a stunt like that.
Sorry, I didn' t know that saving lives was a stunt.
You got a big mouth, and you' re quick on the trigger...... and that is why your ass is in a sling.
If you' re gonna put them off SWAT, at least keep them in the division.
Give them a shot at getting back.
Stick them in the gun cage.
Get them out of my sight.
- Gun cage?
- This is total bullshit.
- What?
- I said, this is bullshit.
- Really?
- Yeah.
You should consider yourself lucky Lt. Velasquez is standing up for you.
I' m lucky I don' t work for an asshole like you.
That' s it!
You' re out of here, Gamble!
You' re gone!
- Control yourself!
- Get out of here!
- What the hell' s the matter with you?
- Street!
- Hey!
Give us a minute.
Please, sit down.
I' il stand.
Look, Jim...... we both know that Gamble is a bad influence on the rest of the team.
Gamble' s a good cop.
Unlike him, you still have a chance at a future here.
You go on record that Gamble acted recklessly...... and you had to follow your partner in after he disobeyed orders...... and I will make sure that you are back on SWAT tomorrow morning.
Let' s get the hell out of here.
I need a cocktail.
I' m staying.
You' re what?
What...?
- After that?
- Couple months...... Fuller will find new asses to chew out.
We' il be back on the team.
Fuller is the cockroach of this department, brother.
He' s not gonna give us a second chance.
What are you gonna do?
Piss away all the hard work you did to get here?
Piss what away, Jimmy?
The cage?
Come on, man.
We' re better than that, and you know it.
You gonna come with me?
A real partner wouldn' t have to ask that, would he?
A real partner would step up to what he did in the bank.
I saved the hostage.
- You disobeyed the hold.
- No, I saved that hostage!
- You disobeyed the hold!
You made the decision yourself.
And you shot a hostage.
Jesus, Brian!
You sound a lot like Fuller.
Is that what you two were talking about in there?
Did you rat me out?
You cut a deal to get back on the team, Jimmy?
- Did I cut a deal?
- Yeah, did you?
How many times have I covered up for one of your goddamn stunts?
That' s what a partner' s supposed to do.
You just picked a paycheck over me, bro.
You just picked yourself over everything else.
You want to stay here and be Fuller' s bitch...... you go right ahead.
I can' t do it.
I can' t do it.
Damn it.
Goddamn it.
Goddamn it, Jim!
Partners for five years.
This is how you want to end it.
I didn' t end it.
You sold me out to the brass.
You know, I never realized till now how full of shit you are.
Fuck you and SWAT.
- You' re too attached to that soda, Gus.
- Love that stuff.
The wife would have my behind if she busted me sucking that down.
Why, is she a Mr. Pibb fan?
You know the deal, Jim.
When we got married, I converted to Mormonism.
We can' t consume anything that alters our state of mind.
We treat our bodies with respect.
And I treat mine like an amusement park.
It' s the differences that make this country great.
Need them cleaned by the morning, boys.
You were supposed to have it in a half- hour ago.
What, your boy gonna report me to the captain?
Just for thinking you look good in that mustache.
Your mom seems to like it, though.
So does your sister.
Hey, sarge, welcome back.
- Look who' s back.
- Welcome back, sarge.
What' s up, Hondo?
Hey, sarge.
- Howdy.
- What do you need?
Sgt. Hondo?
You' re back.
You know what they say, Gus.
You' re either SWAT or you' re not.
Yes, sir.
What can I do for you?
Oh, just a tune- up.
But please, don' t touch my sights.
- And I made some modifications...
- To the trigger too.
- And you are?
- Jim Street.
Street.
Yeah, we' il leave them intact.
- I need that back by tomorrow.
- Can do, sergeant.
- Good to see you.
- Good seeing you.
Gosh, Gus, is that a woody?
Heck, yeah.
That' s Hondo.
He' s old- school SWAT.
The gold standard of ass- kicking.
Sorry, butt- kicking.
I guess he' s back.
I guess he is.
A weeklong series, attacking us top to bottom.
And it' s all SWAT' s fault, right?
No, the chief' s been pretty fair about blaming everyone.
He does want these bad headlines to end.
He wants the old warhorses to help restore the luster.
Old?
I know you ain' t talking about me.
You gotta shake off that three- year rust from Rampart.
- I' m throwing you in right away.
- Sooner the better.
I want you to put together a young, kick- ass element for me, Dan.
You select them, you train them, you mold them.
I know you' re not talking about giving me five pups fresh out of the gate.
- I didn' t come back to wipe noses.
- Hell, no.
Now, you worked with T. J. And Boxer at Southwest.
- You up for supervising them here?
- That' s a start.
Now all you have to do is find three fresh ones.
Only catch is, Fuller has to approve the three.
What did Capt. Fuller say when he heard the chief was bringing me back?
Hasn' t stopped swearing since.
What' s your brother' s truck doing outside?
We having a garage sale I don' t know about?
You weren' t supposed to be home for an hour.
Sorry to screw up your getaway.
Look, let' s not make this a thing, okay?
We both knew it was coming.
It' s not like we were in this to get married, right?
And you' ve changed since...
Well, people change.
Look, when it was good it was great, right?
That means something.
Yeah, thanks.
- Damn it!
- Hey!
Hey!
I' m gonna throw this thing out.
Do and you die.
Every SWAT team in the world' s gonna have one someday.
It' s 50 pounds of scrap metal.
Say you got some crazy suspect barricaded in a house.
- All right.
- Just chain this to the back of a truck...... shove this end right through the wall...... these rods spring out like fishhooks.
Your partner guns the truck, takes the whole wall with him.
And we waltz right in and surprise the bad guy, right?
Correct.
I call it "The Key to the City."
- Patent pending.
- Is that right?
Right.
Let me get your M- 4.
Took the rattle out of the receiver.
Yeah, new buffer, new gas rings.
Cleaned the gas tube.
Surprised you didn' t starch the sling.
If you want me to show you how to shoot it, I' m here all week, 9 to 5.
Shooters, on the line!
Stand by!
Ready!
Put them on safe and holster.
No roll, Hondo?
How do you know I didn' t?
You didn' t, did you?
They only roll in John Woo movies, not real life.
All right.
Here' s the winner.
There' s a few people that I would like to thank.
My fellow SWAT officers, all of you, thank you for believing in me...... when the bosses didn' t give me a chance.
That' s why you' re the marksman and I' m the guy who tells you who to shoot.
Here you go.
I got you covered since I let you down.
Tell you what...... I got 100 here says that guy can kick your ass.
Are you kidding me, Hondo?
He' s our gun bunny.
Oh, well, let' s make it 200 then.
Sure.
A couple more lap dances for me tonight.
- Want a piece of this?
- Yeah.
Don' t look so worried.
Wanna make some extra money?
Hey, don' t forget to take your safety off.
Don' t beat him so badly I can' t get a rematch, all right?
I won' t make any promises.
It' s my money, man.
Shooters, on the line!
Stand by!
Ready!
Holster!
Here' s your winner.
I won, baby.
Thoroughbred!
Passport, please.
Next.
- Next.
- You have anything to declare?
I don' t know how you got this through De Gaulle.
You can' t bring this through the airport.
Luck.
Gift from my father.
Not dangerous.
- Mail it home.
- Okay.
Mail it home.
- Okay?
Okay.
"Merci."
- Hey, Gus!
- Yeah.
Isn' t that eternal damnation you' re chowing down there?
You can' t tell Michelle.
Isn' t she gonna smell the fries on your breath?
That' s why God invented mouthwash.
She' il never know.
Gus, you' re cheating on your wife with fast food.
You' re right.
You' re absolutely right.
Street, you have a driver' s license?
- Got a library card.
- That' s good enough.
So get your uniform on.
You' re driving me today.
Come on.
Did you get my return ticket and papers?
Flight leaves tonight at midnight.
- No one knows I' m here?
- Just me.
Where do you wanna go?
It' s my uncle' s birthday.
I want to surprise him.
If you want me to come by and mow your lawn later...... I' m available, sergeant.
- I' il keep that in mind.
Call me Hondo.
I was a Marine.
Did two years in Nam, recon unit.
Spent the next four teaching combat survival.
- Yeah.
- Navy SEALs, right?
- That' s what my file says.
- So, what did you do for them?
Besides rescue Marines when they got lost?
You sniper detail, amphibious assault, what?
My boat- crew leader always said if anyone knew what we did...... we' d failed.
That' s fair enough.
So where are we going, Hondo?
What say we go see what the weather' s like in South Central?
Tell us where your boyfriend is.
Look, I don' t speak Spanish!
Tell me where your boyfriend is!
You' re not helping him any!
You' re not...
Somebody here gonna get locked up!
R- 61- 15 in foot pursuit.
Suspect headed south, west of Defiance.
One black male in Lakers purple.
One black male in Lakers purple.
That' s our guy talking.
Where' s he at?
What the hell you doing, Navy SEAL?
- Oh, hell yeah!
Get on, baby, get on!
- Come on!
Damn!
That looked like some Oakland Raider Jack Tatum action there.
What you know about Jack Tatum?
Turn your ass over!
Put your hands behind your back!
- Name' s Hondo.
- I don' t give a damn.
I could' ve caught him myself.
If you like hard work, long hours and getting dirty for low pay...... I got an opening on my SWAT team.
Shut up!
I don' t mind that at all.
Pack your bags.
You' re coming to SWAT school.
- SWAT school?
- Shut up!
Don' t talk too much!
Shut up!
Don' t y' all got nothing better to do than be hauling a black man to jail?
Just perpetuating the cycle, ain' t you?
We' il see how liberal you are when he' s breaking into your place.
"Uh- huh," my ass.
Sure you don' t want to sit in the back?
I could wear a little cap.
I like the view from up here.
The cap thing' s a nice touch, though.
Officer Burress, Southwest Division.
Well, your test scores are off the chart, and you got all the right references.
Thank you, sergeant.
Can I get a hot dog with everything and a ginger ale, please?
Hot dog with everything, ginger ale.
- Street?
- Same.
Well, I will have a soy dog, please...... on a whole- wheat bun, plain...... and a tomato juice, if you got it.
Thank you.
I' m a vegetarian.
I' m a bit curious.
You' ve been a cop six years and you' ve never had a civilian complaint?
I try to be courteous and professional with everyone I encounter.
Well, the thing is, Dave...
- David.
David.
Here' s the thing.
There may come a time in SWAT when you gotta get a little dirty...... behind a street bust.
No.
How the hell can I trust a man...... won' t eat a good old- fashioned American hot dog?
He' s a vegetarian.
I' m looking for an injured officer, name of Sanchez.
Chris Sanchez.
- Room five.
In the corner.
- Thank you.
- What do you need, sarge?
- You Sanchez' s partner?
Sanchez do that?
- You help?
- No, sarge.
Reminds me of my third divorce.
- Bad day, huh?
- Kiss my ass, "ése".
I' m starting to like this Sanchez already.
Spent four years in Metro, passed the SWAT quals three times.
Been rejected by Fuller three times.
Might be a reason.
He' s got a couple of beefs here.
I' m going to get the nurse to clean and dress your wound.
Sorry.
Wrong room.
- Who you looking for?
- Chris Sanchez.
I' m Chris Sanchez.
You' re Chris Sanchez?
Look, if you' re Internal Affairs...... that guy had razorblades in his mouth.
I had to put him down hard.
I' m sick and tired of these bullshit complaints because some "vato..."... doesn' t like getting thrown to the pavement by a woman.
I look like IAD to you?
Who are you?
Wait, now, that guy had about 100 pounds on you.
All brawn, no brains.
You didn' t answer my question.
So you still want to work SWAT?
No, I just enjoy applying all the time.
Return it.
Am I looking at another day of chauffeur duty?
- Team' s almost filled.
- Not that it hasn' t been fun.
Well, I do have one more spot.
Can you think of anybody I might' ve overlooked?
This a game or a test, sergeant?
- Could be a bit of both.
- Yeah, I' m a little old for games.
All right.
So how' d you like to be back on SWAT?
It' s not gonna happen.
So why you hanging around the cage then?
It' s a job.
And SWAT' s a calling.
Anybody around you for five minutes can tell you still got the bug.
All you gotta do is say yes.
It' s not up to me or you.
I got a history here.
Yeah, let' s talk about that.
I heard some rumors about you and your old partner.
Did you give him up in Fuller' s office?
Because, you know, team members gotta trust each other.
I' m not on your team.
And no, I didn' t give him up.
You' ve been in that cage six months, shining boots and fixing weapons...... waiting for a second chance.
I got one, and I' m offering it to you.
Fuller will never sign off on it.
You let me deal with that paper- pushing punk.
I want you on my team.
Let me tell you, it' s the sauce.
You know?
My mother, she used to make sauce.
Now you go into the store, and you buy it in a jar or in a can...
Alex?
Alex!
Nobody told me you were coming.
- When did you get here?
- Surprise.
Happy birthday, Uncle.
Come on, sit down.
Sit.
Bring some champagne, huh?
Sit, eat.
The chief' s making me take you back.
He' s concerned about losing all his best officers.
- He thinks I' m one of his best officers?
- But...... he' s given me complete oversight.
And trust me, you got no room for error.
So I will give you Boxer, T. J. McCabe and this new guy...... Deacon Kaye.
I have to pass on the other two.
Sanchez is a woman, and Street...
Well, Street' s on my shitlist.
Hey, I' m on your shitlist too, and I' m the team leader.
You work for me now, and it' s my team to choose.
With all due respect, captain, other leaders get to pick their teams.
And you can too.
Just pick two new people.
Look...... just give me the team I ask for.
You can even call it your shitlist team.
That way, if anything goes wrong, you can put all the blame on me.
It' d be just like old times.
Okay.
Okay, you got your team.
But when you fail, and you probably will fail...... Sanchez goes back to Traffic, and you and Street are plain gone.
No, not just off SWAT, off the force.
- You feel me?
- Oh, yeah.
I feel you.
- Okay, I' m leaving now.
- No, don' t go.
Come on.
I have a flight to catch.
- Oh, catch another flight.
Let me introduce you to Monica.
You like this knife?
He gave it to me.
It' s a beautiful knife, and she' s a beautiful woman.
Now, why don' t you stay, have a good time and go back tomorrow.
Listen, I' m running the business now.
I' m the new boss.
And don' t ever forget, your father' s running the business.
No, I retired him.
He never spoke of that to me.
That' s because he can' t speak anymore.
You put your hand in my father' s pocket.
Not in mine.
Understood?
Mail it to me.
- Smile!
Good evening.
May I see your license, registration and proof of insurance?
I' m visiting the U. S.
I have my passport if you want.
Let me see it.
Whose car is this?
Why?
You got a left taillight out.
Hi, this is Bridget the Midget.
We' re out here in front of the Key Club on Sunset in beautiful Hollywood.
I just wonder how you can get inside of there.
Anyways, we' re on Sunset Boulevard, where anything could happen.
Especially police harassment.
Hey, you guys, you' re all pigs!
Is your uncle' s name Martin Gascoigne?
So we' re okay?
- There' s a warrant in that name...... and I have to detain you until we can verify who you are.
Sir, please step out of the vehicle.
- You' re here awful early.
- Traffic was lighter than usual.
Streets must' ve been damn near empty.
Ali' s his sister.
And I called bottoms on the last one.
You called bottoms, but that' s not what you got.
- What' s happening?
- Jim.
- Boxer.
So, what did you do to my sister?
Nothing.
That' s not what I heard.
I mean, that' s not the word on the street.
She' s all broken up over you.
She left me.
- Dumped.
A case of crabs will do that to a woman.
Is there something about this team I need to know?
I want to know what an asshole like you...... did to my little sister to make her leave.
She' s 28, all right?
And trust me, she' s not so little.
- Trust you?
- No, you didn' t.
How' s your last partner doing?
Gamble.
He trust you too?
- You wanna talk about this?
- You gonna tell me?
Been on your chest for a while, yeah?
Street!
You wanna talk about it?
Come here.
- Don' t talk about what you don' t...
- Yo!
Street!
It' s not worth it.
Who else you gonna narc on?
Who are you?
Who the hell are you?
Guess you' re not the prettiest one here anymore, huh, T. J.?
Well, sounds like you' ve all gotten acquainted.
Let' s get started.
I' il make this simple.
L. A. P. D. SWAT is the most honored, most respected...... and most professional police division in the world.
Go, go, go!
- Police!
- Police!
Police!
That ain' t gonna get it.
Sanchez.
Money.
Oh, man.
That sucked.
- What' s up, Sanchez?
- You all right there?
When you' re done with that one, I got one for you.
Looking for the boat.
Got it.
Street, you got three aces.
Need one to take T. J. Out.
Got a winner, winner!
All right, Deke.
Let' s see what you got.
Ten of spades.
Spade flush.
Not good enough.
Hondo, isn' t that a straight flush?
Hold the phone.
Six, seven...... eight, nine, ten of spades!
Deke!
Beats four aces in Compton any day.
I think it works in Orange County too.
Sure you' re right.
Good work, guys.
Police!
Police!
Clear.
- Clear.
- Clear.
Go.
That' s right.
SWAT is a life- saving organization, not a life- taking one.
That' s why the FBI and Secret Service come here to train with us.
Smooth, Deke.
I guess if I was deaf, I wouldn' t know you were here.
But while you' re laughing, there' s lots of people that want us to fail.
Get it right.
- Clear.
- Clear.
Clear.
Suspect, put your hands on your head and come out.
- Come out!
- Come out now!
- Turn around.
- Go!
- Down.
- Get down.
Yeah.
Outstanding, guys.
You feel that?
The team' s going out for beers later.
I' m buying.
I' il take mine after we pass.
Well, Fuller' s definitely gonna try and hose us.
Good.
I' d hate to break a sweat just for a first- round knockout.
Hey, we got a big day tomorrow.
Save some.
I got plenty.
I' m depending on you to get these guys through this.
I' il cover my end.
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah, go for it.
Why' d you pick me?
To piss off the captain.
All right, here' s the scenario.
There are six hijackers armed with handguns and knives...... in control of that plane.
They' ve killed one hostage and are threatening to kill the others...... unless they get a pilot and fuel within the hour.
There' il be SWAT officers disguised as hostages.
Other SWAT officers will be playing the roles of terrorists.
And they will be trying to kill you.
Staff sergeants will be grading us.
Couldn' t give us the bus, huh, Hondo?
They always give us the bus.
- Fuller' s really got it in for us.
- You think?
Another thing.
There are two dynamic entry points.
One here beneath the front landing gear...... one back here by the baggage compartment.
I' m sure Fuller' s got surprises at both those entrances.
We get bogged down anywhere, we fail.
Any ideas?
There' s another way in, Hondo.
There' s an elevator shaft where they bring in the service carts.
And there' s a mechanic' s access right here.
- Man, that' s gonna be tight as hell.
- Yeah.
How many men can we fit in there?
Men?
None.
All right.
Work this out.
Get in there and break Fuller' s heart.
- Okay.
- What do we got?
- Toy guns.
- Toy guns, sir.
Toy guns.
- Let' s do this.
- All right.
Shame you' re not playing a terrorist.
I' m supposed to be in first class.
We got camera three going up.
Three is set.
Checked it out on the monitor.
- "Are you ready?"
- Oh, yeah.
Okay, let' s see what they got.
- How' d you know about this place?
- I' ve known a few stewardesses.
Just a few?
- Stand by.
We got a device.
- Same here.
Disarmed.
Set.
Here we go.
Three.
Two.
One.
Boxer, one down.
Down!
Damn.
- "Deke?"
- I got one down.
- "McCabe?"
- "I got one."
Sanchez, one down.
That' s five.
There' s one more, guys.
Come on.
Come on.
That' il be six.
- "Clear."
- Clear.
- Clear.
- Clear.
10- David, this is 70- David.
We are Code Four.
All clear.
Is that a new course record?
- Yeah.
- All right.
Good job, guys.
Damn.
Please, Pop, please.
- Yo, Sanchez.
- I' m in SWAT now.
Yo, Deke.
Deke, is that you, man?
Oh, my God, Deke.
- Tell me that ain' t you.
- You were a butterball.
That' s all in the past.
I ate here every day, worked here every summer.
I ended up looking like Fat Albert.
I' m cool.
Eating right has me looking like this.
Man, put that away.
Hey, put that away.
Put another in for me.
Hey, yeah, break out your money.
- Work it, baby.
Watch it.
Hey!
So you' re celebrating without me, huh?
- Mr. Kaye, you' re the master.
- Like son, like father.
- That was one kick- ass display today.
- That' s what I' m talking about.
All right, but let' s remember one thing.
If that was a real operation and not a test...... one of us would be calling T. J. 's family...... trying to explain what went wrong today.
One casualty may be acceptable by department standards...... never acceptable by mine.
We clear on that?
Got you.
- Crystal.
- Yes, sir.
All right.
Well, let' s continue celebrating tonight...... but tomorrow, we' re SWAT.
Nice.
I love you too.
Homeland Security, my ass.
They can' t keep me like this.
I' ve been patient, day after day.
So tell me, what' s going on?
Your prints do not match your ID.
So they' re running another check through the FBI and Interpol.
Interpol, shit.
Get me out of here.
- I' m doing everything I can.
- Do more.
This is easy.
Who do we have to pay?
You can' t solve this problem by throwing money at it.
Then who do we have to kill?
Come on, guys, it' s only 11: 00.
I got a babysitter for the first time in three months.
- We' ve been up since 4: 00.
- That' s weak.
If I get home by midnight, I might get me some.
T. J.?
I get home before midnight, I' m finding some.
Sorry, babe.
- Boxer?
- I know I' m not getting some.
If I don' t get home soon, my wife' s gonna freak.
You guys suck.
You know how hard it is to find a babysitter?
Yo, Street.
Did you pass?
- Yeah.
- Awesome.
- First round' s on the house.
- Thanks, darling.
Anything but tequila, please.
- No?
- No.
- We did good today, huh?
- Yeah.
What' s it like...... the real thing?
It' s faster.
It' s a lot faster.
You know that guy?
Used to.
Bye.
See you.
It' s all yours, man.
- How you doing?
- Oh, man, I am good.
- Heard they took you back.
- Yeah.
This your girlfriend?
No.
No, she' s SWAT.
- She wha...?
- She' s...
This is what it' s come down to, busting down doors with J. Lo?
You know, I didn' t know that they made bulletproof bras.
You know, I didn' t know that.
What they need to make are bulletproof condoms...... big enough to fit your big head.
Nice.
Good, I like it.
This your girlfriend?
Cute.
No, but you can be my bitch.
Really?
No, man, leave it alone.
- Here we go.
- Leave it alone.
- Hey.
How are you?
- I' m good.
Put it on my tab?
Hey, glad to see all that butt- kissing' s really paid off.
Say hi to Fuller for me.
What?
You should' ve let me kick his ass.
I just saved yours.
So you and this guy Gamble were partners, huh?
So how long you got the babysitter for?
Just because I bought you a drink doesn' t mean...... you get laid tonight.
So, what does two drinks mean?
Do you want to come over to my house?
That was easy.
It' s my kid' s birthday party tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Kids, birthday parties...
I' m hosting a Tupperware party tomorrow.
- You, Tupperware?
- Yeah, seals in the freshness.
Party' s completely booked, otherwise I' d invite you.
Tomorrow, noon.
Central, open South Sally port.
All right, gentlemen, take a seat.
You may have won the battle, but you lost the war!
- Dad, can I have some of this?
- Yeah, go ahead, get it.
- Can I have this too?
- Whatever you want.
Look at that.
A cop who drinks French champagne.
That is just impressive.
I may work in the mud, but I certainly like to play up in the clouds.
I thought you said you' d fix the sink.
This is Lt. Harrelson, O lympic SWAT commander.
This is top priority.
Patch me through to all black and whites in the area.
- I gotta go.
- Kids, come on, come on.
- It' s time to ruin Mommy' s day.
But you killed in the soccer game!
Come on, don' t just stand there!
Baby, I have to go play cops and robbers.
Okay.
- Okay.
Me too.
Hey, guys, the reason we are gathered on our God- given...... much- needed day of rest is we have a Polish hostage.
- So what if he' s Polish?
- No, no.
"Anybody comes in, I' il blow my head off" type of guys.
Negotiations aren' t going well.
- They think he' s off his meds.
This guy' s still smoking cigarettes, popping off shotgun rounds...... out the front door.
I want a limo, a 12- pack and clove cigarettes!
I say we go in the back, hard with shields.
Guy says he has all the doors and windows wired...... with high explosives.
- Come on, Greg!
I just read it.
Any suggestions?
I got an idea.
Ready?
It' s the damn robot aliens.
Down!
Down!
Down!
- Put your hands behind your back.
- Stay down.
I think he might be Polish.
Unbelievable.
- Like opening a can of sardines.
Drop Fruit of the Loomski in the A- car.
Damn, man, you need to be selling that shit on eBay.
- No, I only got one.
- Split the profits 50- 50.
Corner the market.
Break them down like a shotgun.
"The Polish Penetrator."
I just got a call from Sheriff' s.
It seems we' ve been...... holding a high- priority international and didn' t even know it.
- They want us as escorts?
- You' re my new favorite crew.
Just get the prisoner to headquarters.
This is 9- Tom King transporting inmates to Superior.
We' ve got a black and white signaling a pullover.
What' s your 10- 20?
Hollywood and Wilcox.
9- Tom King, stand by while we identify the black and white.
Roger.
"9" - "Tom King, there is a problem" with one of your transports.
The unit signaling is probably providing interception.
Can you read his patrol number?
It' s an L. A. P. D. Black and white.
Stand by while we confirm.
9- Tom King, this is 70- David.
What' s your location?
"9" - "Tom King, do you copy?"
What about me, boss?
Let' s go.
"9" - "Tom King, there is a problem."
9- Tom King, do you copy?
There it is, on the right.
- "9" - "Tom King, do you copy?"
- This is 70- David.
We' re Code Six with the bus at Hollywood and Wilcox.
114, this is 70- David.
We' re Code Four.
114, this is 70- David.
We' re Code Six at Hollywood and Wilco x.
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
- Out of the car!
- Get out of the car.
- On the ground now!
- Get out of the car!
- Down!
- Let' s see your hands!
Freeze!
Put your hands on your head!
Hands up!
Hollywood, huh?
On the ground!
On the ground!
Do not move!
Do not move!
Move again!
Move again!
Drama in Hollywood today.
An explosive and deadly day in Hollywood as a gun battle erupted...... between armed suspects and members of L. A. P. D. 's SWAT unit.
Details are still sketchy, but sources tell us there were fatalities...... including two Los Angeles County Sheriff' s deputies.
At 1: 45 p. m.
We are awaiting the arrival of Alex Montel...... the international fugitive wanted in over a dozen countries.
Montel is wanted on Interpol warrants by more than...... ten national governments, including our own...... in relationship to charges of arms dealing, drug trafficking...... extortion, smuggling, kidnapping and over two dozen murders.
Domestic and foreign law enforcement agencies...... are already jockeying to interrogate the man...... one high- level White House aide has dubbed simply "The Catch."
I will give $100 million to whoever gets me out of here!
Let' s go!
One hundred million dollars!
The family' s legitimate business in Europe and the Middle East...... are rumored to be fronts for their criminal activity throughout the world.
The family fortune is estimated to be in the high hundreds of millions...... if not billions of dollars.
I will give $100 million to whoever gets me out of here!
- 100 million sound good to me.
Are we hot?
We have limited footage of the dramatic events this afternoon.
- "An offer of"...
- "One hundred million dollars..."... to whoever gets me out of here.
The family' s fortune is estimated in the billions of dollars.
- "An offer of $100 million."
- Who does this guy think he is?
Hey, "ése", are you for real or what, homes?
Hey, I' m talking to you, "ése"!
We' ve been looking for this punk a long time.
Busted taillight brings him down?
That' s amazing.
The plan is to have you escort him to a federal prison out in the desert.
It' s a hell of a story.
Yeah, we' il pass that request up the ladder to D. C.
- Good.
- Gentlemen, at 1300 hours...... an L. A. P. D. Helicopter will arrive to transport the defendant.
Until we get him inside a federal facility, he' s our baby.
Sgt. Howard, your team' s got the high ground.
- Yes, sir.
Your boys are gonna provide close proximity protection for the prisoner.
- Copy that.
You' re gonna set up a perimeter around Parker Center.
- I' m on it.
- Piece of cake.
Roger, 10- David, we' re coming out.
Okay, guys, let' s get this frog in the bird.
What' s $100 million six ways, Box?
Sixteen- something.
Man, I' d have floor seats at the Lakers, put my kids through college...... hire Halle Berry as my yoga instructor.
- Match engine power.
Gear down now.
Cover!
We' ve been hit!
Shots fired.
Did anybody see where it came from?
- Hit second engine.
Going down.
- Mayday!
Mayday!
We' re going down!
Down!
Everybody okay?
- Let' s go!
Let' s go!
70- David to 114!
We' re coming in!
- Come here.
- Hey!
Jim!
Street!
Keep it together, buddy.
Keep it together.
- Keep it together.
- Shut up!
We don' t have time for your personal shit.
- Move him out.
Let' s move!
Move!
You tell them we' re under attack!
An L. A. P. D. Airship is down.
How do you want us to proceed at this point?
- What the hell happened?
- Somebody shot our bird down.
No shit.
My guess is big- bore rifle,. 50 caliber.
Somebody who knows how to use it.
- We' re at a whole new level here.
- So where the hell is the shooter?
I want this asshole out of here now.
Best bet' s to keep him on lockdown till we see who we' re dealing with.
- Capt. Fuller?
I' ve got the chief of police on the phone for you.
So now we' re talking about my ass.
You draw up a plan, you execute it, and do not screw this up.
Have it transferred to my office.
Can' t believe how much grief that frog' s $100 million offer' s bringing us.
You guys ready?
You know what you gotta do?
- Yes, sir.
- Where' s T. J.?
I' m right here, Hondo.
Had some bad Thai food last night.
- It' s not sitting well with me.
- So are you good to go or what?
No, I' m good now.
Let' s go make the captain look like a hero.
- Be safe out there.
- Headed to the bird.
All right, we' re moving out.
Let' s load them up!
Time to go.
Put that on.
Marry me!
Marry me, Alex!
Marry me!
Marry me!
Hey!
Come on!
Oh, shit.
Hey, come on now, get out of the damn street!
Wait there.
Alex, let' s go!
Get down!
Get down now!
- Get on the ground!
- Keep your hands on your head!
- Hands up!
I got him!
I don' t know, talk to them.
Try to make it work.
Look, I' ve had enough problems for one day, you know?
- Hey, where' s Mike?
- Family emergency.
- Let me know if you need anything.
Just try to get us there alive, for starters.
- My sister' s dating some new guy.
Yeah, I met him for the first time the other night.
Good for her.
Not really.
He' s kind of a knucklehead.
You should give her a call, you know, if you want.
All right, yeah.
10- David to 70- David.
- Word our motorcade has been hit.
- "Terry Fargas is dead."
- Damn!
And we' ve got two patrol officers on the table at County.
- What' s your location, 10- David?
- Right on top of you.
- That' s good to know.
T. J., stay alert back there.
They' re coming out of the woodwork.
- American greed.
- So reliable.
- Shut up!
Another officer' s dead because you shot your mouth off.
- That' s how I like cops, dead.
- Want to join him?
He knew the dangers, no?
That' s why he signed up to be a police officer.
Carry a gun in the Wild West.
Like you, cowboy.
Would you be sitting here if this job wasn' t dangerous?
Anyway...... killing him probably got you 20 new recruits.
You should thank me.
Yeah, you' re right.
- Boxer, thank him for me, will you?
- Love to.
We are coming up on checkpoint one.
Roger, Hondo, I see it.
Making the turn...... at checkpoint one.
- Hardcore, Sanchez.
- I' m watching everyone' s hands.
Empty hand, no weapon, I' m going home to my little girl, Deke.
I' m going home to my brats too.
We' re now approaching checkpoint two.
T. J., relax, man.
Hondo transported the president like this back in '96.
Hey, my friends.
I can double my offer.
Sixty- six million for each of you.
All you have to do is let me go right here.
And don' t worry.
I' il find my way home.
You got the cash?
Because we don' t take a check.
Come on.
What do you make?
Sixty- six thousand a year?
Not even with overtime.
Loser.
Making the turn at checkpoint two.
My view of Car Two has been blocked.
T. J., what' s happening?
I got a pedestrian in the crosswalk.
I' il be on your tail in about 10 seconds.
Roger that.
Hands where I can see them, guys.
- T. J., what the hell are you doing?
- What the hell does it look like?
I' m taking Frenchie here up on his offer.
Now, you guys just be smart.
Hands up, Box!
Come on.
Hands up!
Hands up, Box.
Let' s go, let me see it.
Hands up!
What the hell was that?
- What was that, Bri?
- He was going for his piece.
I had it under control!
- You didn' t have to shoot him!
- What do you say, Jimbo?
- Want to be a cowboy?
- T. J., Street, Boxer!
- "Car Two, respond!"
- We' re catching up to you, sarge.
- We' il be there in about...
- Officer down!
- Flip a bitch!
- Flipping a bitch.
- 10- David!
- Move!
Do you have a location on car number two?
- Move!
Move!
Move!
Car Two is stopped at 7 th and Hope.
Do me a favor.
Tell Fuller it was me who pulled this off, yeah?
I' m not gonna let you get away with this, Gamble.
Well, you ain' t got a say in the matter, do you?
Suspects wearing tactical clothing and have automatic weapons.
T. J., don' t do this!
I got an officer down!
Officer down!
Suspects are entering the Pershing Square MTA station.
- Boxer, hang in there!
Hang in there.
I' m all right.
Boxer got hit.
We' re gonna need an ambulance!
- Who did this?
- It was Gamble.
- Box!
- Get him up.
It was T. J. And Gamble.
They' ve gone down the subway.
Let' s go hunting.
- I' m gonna get the kit!
- Take care of him.
- Yeah.
- Street, let' s go!
This is 73- David.
I need an RA unit...... as soon as possible to the corner of Hope and 7 th.
Officer down!
I repeat, officer down!
All right, T., we' re in.
Let' s go.
Hit the juice, grandpa.
Come on, Box.
Come on, come on, come on!
- What do we got?
- Gunshot wound to the neck.
- Vitals?
- None.
Come on!
Let' s go!
Always one step behind.
This is 70- David at 7 th and Hope.
Suspects are on eastbound train number 5- 0- 7...... headed to Metro Center at 7 th and Figueroa.
Have the rail unit contact M TA...... and shut it down at the next station.
What are they gonna do, take the subway all the way to Mexico?
Come on, check for secondary wounds.
Sanchez!
Meet that train at the next station.
73- David, we copy.
You better be good for it.
I assure you, if anyone is, it' s me.
I want you to set up a perimeter.
Nobody comes in the station and nobody gets off a train.
Yes, sir.
You got it.
Rail unit, this is 10- David.
I' ve got my men headed to the Figueroa station.
- Are you ready to stop that train?
- "Yes, sir."
- Where' s this train?
Should' ve been here by now.
Sanchez to Hondo.
The train never made it to Figueroa.
Secure the station.
SWAT' s got it.
Got people.
Hands up!
Let me see your hands!
Hands.
Hands!
Hands.
Show him your hands.
Hands.
Where are they?
- They said they were gonna kill me.
- They' re not coming back.
Down the shaft.
Where' d they go?
10- David, this is 70- David.
Suspects have entered what appears to be a storm drain...... approximately a quarter- mile north of Metro Center.
Roger that, 70- David.
We' il deploy above ground accordingly.
We' re going in after them.
This shaft intersects with the storm- drain system.
They could pop out of any manhole in a five- mile radius.
- How many manholes are we talking?
- 6000.
I can' t cover 6000...
R- Commander, 10- David.
Put that airship down and give me...... a command post at Sixth and Hope Street.
And give me a landline, Code Two.
70- David to 10- David.
70- David to 10- David.
70- David to 114.
Do you read me?
70- David to 114.
Do you read me?
We got no reception down here.
Gamble wants us on an island...... he' s got it.
Stay alert, guys.
They went this way.
- "We have ID' d those suspects."
Who are they?
Former Officer Gamble and Officer T. J. McCabe.
Gamble, as in Street' s ex- partner Gamble?
Roger.
There is some kind of plan here, right?
There' s your plan, pumpkin.
We have got two SWAT- trained guys leading this attack.
How do we know the rest aren' t in on it?
Because I can vouch for Hondo.
Willing to bet $100 million on that?
Bingo.
You gotta be shitting me.
If they' re good, this is only gonna slow them down, T. J.
This was supposed to be simple snatch and extract.
- Boxer was a threat.
- He was my friend!
- He was mine too!
- Stop crying, you can buy new friends.
Don' t give me any more reasons to kill you.
What are you going to do, shoot me?
You should relax a little bit, my friend.
I' m the money here.
Don' t forget it.
We don' t have time for this shit.
Look, you can go ahead.
I know this sucks.
Let' s worry about it in paradise, all right?
Come on.
Have we re- established contact with Hondo?
Not yet, sir.
70- David, advise your location, please.
70- David, come in.
Hondo, where the hell are you?
What' s that?
- It' s phosphorescent paint.
Keep your eyes on the wall for more.
- Gas masks?
- It' s just smoke.
We' re gonna have to go in blind.
What' s going on?
Tripwire.
Live mine.
Nasty stuff.
- No shit.
There' s an old Indian saying:
Where there' s one white man...
There' s more white men.
What?
Do you hear something?
No.
That' s the problem.
Come on, we gotta move.
- You all smell like shit.
- That would be a sewer.
- Where' s our air?
- On track and on schedule.
Wonderful.
T. J., ride with me.
Come on, guys, gotta go!
All units in the vicinity of the Hawthorne Airport:
Residents report beacon lights turned on after closing hours.
Dispatch, R- Commander.
Deploy all available units...... to Hawthorne Airport.
Call the FAA for details.
They' re gonna fly him out of the country.
10- David, this is R- Commander.
Get your men there as soon as possible.
Roger that.
Unit One, what' s your status?
We are approximately 45 miles due east of Point Bravo.
We have begun our descent.
That' s a six- minute ETA.
Roger that.
- Ain' t this a bitch?
- A cold, hard one.
10- David to R- Commander, we are approaching Hawthorne Airport.
- Street!
How about the claymore?
- Shit!
I' il be back.
Deke!
10- David to R- Commander.
We have established a perimeter around the airport.
Additional SWAT units are en route.
Van One, Van Two, you have less than five minutes.
Roger that, 10- David.
Any word from Hondo' s team?
- 70- David is still out of radio contact.
- Hondo, you son of a bitch!
You sure you know what you' re doing?
Remember when you asked me what I used to do in the SEALs?
Oh, yeah.
All right, clear.
Fire in the hole.
10- David, this is 70- David.
70- David, where the hell are you?
We are somewhere around Sixth and Trenton.
We lost communication in the tunnels.
Where' s our backup?
Hawthorne Airport.
That' s where your friends...... Gamble and T. J. McCabe are headed.
That' s the other side of town!
Send a couple units to pick us up.
Pick you up?
For all I know, you' re in on this!
- "I got a good mind to bring you in."
- Like hell.
Come on, let' s go.
- Police!
Stop the car!
- Stop the vehicle!
- Stop the car!
- Stop the car!
Stop the car!
Exit the car, sir!
- You guys have to get out of here.
- Police emergency.
- Wait, I just have kids in the car.
- Well, get them out of there!
- It' s us in the gun cage tomorrow.
- You know how it is, Street.
Sometimes doing the right thing ain' t doing the right thing.
- Last car through.
Bridge is locked.
- Copy that.
- I thought you couldn' t drive.
- I said I didn' t like to.
Keep getting into accidents.
Sounds like they' re trying to fly him out of here.
Why would they turn on the lights and warn everybody?
Shit!
Gamble' s smarter than that.
There' s a full moon.
A rookie could land on a night like this.
- So why' d they pop up back there?
- I don' t know.
But Fuller' s sending all we got to Hawthorne.
Did they build a new airport in downtown in the past couple of days?
I don' t think so, Sanchez.
That jet to your right, it' s flying pretty low, and it' s only getting lower.
- That' s our boy!
- He' s setting down.
- Yeah, but where?
- I don' t know, but follow that jet.
- How wide is the Sixth Street Bridge?
- It' s gotta be four lanes across...... sidewalks.
Plane small enough...... he might be able to set it down, if he' s got the balls.
Reducing speed.
This is 70- David.
That plane' s not coming to Hawthorne.
I gave you a direct order to stand down, sergeant.
And I would have, Tom...... except I saw a Learjet about to land on the Sixth Street Bridge.
- Give me 40 percent flaps.
- Forty percent flaps, check.
Sir, we have reports of a low- flying aircraft in the downtown area.
- Where' s the nearest backup?
- Five, six minutes.
I don' t think you' re feeling me on this, Tom.
We' re going in.
Oh, God!
- Reverse thrust.
- Roger that.
Full brake.
This guy' s worth every penny.
All right, let' s turn this plane around.
10- David, we just got a report a plane has landed on the Sixth Street Bridge.
They what?
Let' s mount up!
All right, give me a car downstairs now.
- What?
What' s going on?
- Just got room for one of you.
- I' m not going without my wife!
- Well then, don' t.
No!
Richard!
- Jesus Christ!
- Richard!
Richard...
Richard is gone, so sit down and shut up!
Twenty seconds!
See you in Margaritaville.
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Please, just let me go.
- Please, let me go!
- Shut her up!
- Come on!
- Shut the hell up!
Get us in the air.
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, let' s go home.
They' ve got their own airport security.
You' ve got company!
Limo broke containment!
All right, we got you covered, man.
Just keep coming.
Son of a bitch!
Here.
- What' s this?
- Well, that' d be a cell phone.
That' s the account where I want the money transferred.
The bank verifies the transfer, goddamn if you ain' t a free man.
70- David, be advised there are hostages onboard.
All right, you heard the man.
- Deke!
- Yo!
They get that plane off the ground, those hostages are dead.
I need your A- game, boys and girl.
- What' s going on?
- Get them off our asses!
Just fly the plane.
Open the hatch.
- Come on!
- Open the hatch!
Hang on!
The World' s Most Exciting "Police Chases" pays off.
I got no shot!
Get this thing in the air!
Come on!
Shut that goddamn door!
- I hope you got a plan B, brother.
You stay there.
You' re fine.
- Gamble!
Let her go!
- Take a shot, Jimbo!
- Sanchez is down!
- Sanchez.
Go get him.
Give me more ammo!
Deke!
Frog' s running!
- Are you okay?
- I' m all right, man.
- No.
Tell Daddy how you want it.
You' re like a goddamn rash!
You might want to get that looked at, brother.
- How' s Boxer?
- What do you care?
Just give me that.
He' s gonna make it.
Good.
Just couldn' t resist, could you?
So, what do you want to do?
Goddamn it, sarge.
There' s one in the chamber, partner.
Come on.
- So how' s Boxer?
- Got word he' s gonna pull through.
That' s great.
Remind me to buy some shares in KEVLAR.
Good work, Sanchez.
You look like you need a Band- Aid.
Somebody else needs a body bag downstairs.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
You?
- Good stuff.
- Nice job.
Don' t sound so happy.
He' s still here.
Road trip?
- Road trip.
- Yeah.
Road trip.
Guess you' il have to fire us later.
Transferring custody of L. A. Police Department prisoner...... number 109672 into federal custody.
Thank you, sir.
I will accept the transfer.
Enjoy your new home.
Try your best to get to know the guys.
Yeah, 100 mil ought to buy you a nice husband in there.
Where to, boys?
Home sounds like a winner.
Girls like you get guys like me in trouble.
You think I should' ve taken the 100 million?
All units, we have a 211 in progress at the Diamond Mart...... 43 S. Hope Street.
Shots fired.
Technically, our watch has been over for 12 hours.
So?
Yeah.
What the hell.
Top that off for you, honey?
There you go.
What' s in the case?
I' m sorry?
You' re always Iugging that case around.
I' m curious, what do you seIl?
I' m in restaurant supplies.
I' m sorry, I didn' t get your name.
You must traveI a Iot, huh?
Whole country or just hereabouts?
- I don' t mean to be rude, but -- - How' s your wife feeI about it?
- She must get Ionely...... you gone aII the time.
- Look, I -- - Do you get Ionely?
You miss fucking her, Harold?
Look, I don' t know who you are, but you can' t just sit down --
Did it myself.
Kind of a hobby.
Take a Iook at these pictures...... and you teII me if you see anything you want.
I' ve got Iots more.
Would you Iike to see them?
TeII me, the jokes about the salesman and the farmer' s daughter, they true?
This one' s my favourite!
ReaIly says it aIl.
Wouldn' t you agree?
You are sick.
It' s a matter of opinion.
There' s a rest stop next off- ramp.
PuII into it.
- I have money, it' s not a Iot -- - Nobody wants your money.
Just puII in.
Because I wouldn' t wanna do this at 7 0 miles an hour.
Could be dangerous.
Agent Mackelway.
Welcome to Albuquerque.
Rick Charleton.
Miss Payton' s the nice girI at the front desk.
She puts together a package for aII the new agents.
Everything you need to know about the area...... help with finding apartments and such.

Tom.
Tom, do you Iike Frito pies?
I don' t know what they are.
Welcome to the minors.
Here, Iet me do that.
- Thank you.
- Don' t know how to make coffee.
It takes some experience.
Isn' t there a Starbucks around here?
- That' s a joke, right?
So you' re Mackelway?
Yeah, Agent Mackelway.
Katie Payton.
It' s the room next door.
- Yeah.
Thank you.
- No problem.
Nice meeting you.
Mackelway...... you gonna stand around aII day, or you wanna do something?
Afternoon, Rick.
Looks Iike a robbery- homicide.
- Body is back over there.
- You run the plates?
FeIlow' s name is Harold Speck, traveIling salesman from T or C.
T or C?
Truth or Consequences.
It' s a town, slick.
I' II write that down.
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What' s it Iook Iike, bud?
You ever heard of evidentiary procedure?
Icarus case number 690.
Physicians in charge, Dr. Galin J. Peterson...... and Dr. Ferdinand Kov oskis.
Theta- wave entrainment for RV subject O' Ryan...... to be used with GPS for target management.
Session to commence in...... five, four...... three, two...... one.
Target number, write it now.
Focus.
Stay objective.
SmeIls Iike clove.
Describe it.
Short, one word.
One word.
Draw the environment.
One target at a time.
One target at a time.
Draw the environment.
Draw the environment now.
Sir.
Sort of a stickler for procedure.
I imagine you would be.
Christ.
See it.
See it, draw it now.
Shoes are on the wrong feet.
AII American Diner, GaIlup, New Mexico.
- He had breakfast there this morning.
Agent Mackelway, we' re over here.
I was gonna introduce you two, but I understand that won' t be necessary.
Seems your former office decided we needed help...... so they sent us Agent Kulok.
- Hey, Tom.
- Hi, Fran.
I guess we' re gonna skip the tearfuI reunion.
Have a seat, Tom.
How are things in DaIlas?
Wouldn' t reaIly know.
I' ve been chained to a desk.
Okay, what do we know?
Okay.
Wounds on Speck' s throat indicate he was strangled from behind.
I think our guy was waiting for him in the back seat...... sprung this on him once the car was moving.
Lab picked up talcum traces along the edges...... consistent with powdered gloves.
So he gets this dropped in his Iap...... it spooks him, car ends up in the ravine.
That car was pushed to the state Iine.
The depth of the tire tracks...... footprints near the embankment.
That car wasn' t going more than 3 miles an hour...... and it stopped IiteraIly on the state Iine.
Guy must have used GPS.
Why would he push it to the state Iine?
Same reason he did everything else, to get the FBl' s undivided attention.
There' s an association here.
You have a circle...... and a Iidless eye that' s always open.
Or making sure that we' re seeing.
It' s just a feeling.
You know, kind of quiet.
He Iiked to read fishing magazines, and he wasn' t much of a tipper.
- Is that a Iousy thing to say?
Could you teII us about the other man?
Like I said, I never reaIly saw him.
Harold came up complaining about the guy...... but by the time I turned around, he was gone.
- Can you describe him, ma' am?
- Oh, sure.
You could teII he wasn' t from around here.
Did you see what he was driving?
You know, now that you mention it...... there' s a Torino out in the parking Iot with a reaI crappy paint job.
It' s been here since Iast night.
We need a protocoI for interviewing witnesses.
I' II handle it.
Always in control.
TeII you something, Tom...... I want my Iife back, so I want this over quick.
So, what happened?
Your ring.
It didn' t work out...... just Iike us.
So why are you here?
You vacationing in Albuquerque?
Oh, Tom, you sure haven' t changed in six whole months.
Keys are in the car.
I don' t need a babysitter...... so Iet' s do it right this time.
Then don' t make things so unnecessarily complicated again.
- Trunk' s ajar.
- You Iistening to me?
You think I wanna be down here?
I' m not interested in hanging out...... and I' m not your babysitter.
I didn' t put you here, remember.
And I' m not going through this again with you.
A circle with a slash.
- What' s your 20?
Hey, Tom, got an ID on our body.
Barney Fulcher, age 50...... sixth- grade teacher from Colorado.
Forget them.
This guy started in Oklahoma, Ieft these for us.
Mrs. Speck...... I just heard.
I didn' t know him weIl, but I think Harold was a more complex person...... than people realize.
He was, wasn' t he?
I' m reaIly sorry for your Ioss, ma' am.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
So it wasn' t Fulcher' s car?
Car was registered to a Daniel Dyson...... runs a halfway house in Oklahoma City.
Dyson?
DanieI Dyson?
HeIlo?
What a fucking freak.
Can I help you?
Why didn' t you report it as stolen?
The truth is, I always hated that car.
Nobody but Benjamin could ever make it run right.
Is that his name, Benjamin?
It' s hard to say.
That' s what he Iiked to be caIled.
This bad wiring.
I think we' ve got an obsessive- compulsive here.
Give me that.
These came from Benjamin?
He used to spend hours down here.
It was Iike -- Like his office.
What are these?
With those numbers and pictures, he said he could find anybody.
Benjamin O' Ryan?
SpeciaI Agent Benjamin O' Ryan, FBl.
It was his fantasy.
Agent Mack elway, what the fuck were you thinking?
He' s got nine murders in his pock et, and he' s gonna walk.
Hey, Starkey.
What made you think you could cross the border into Mexico...... without an extradition order?
I knew he was gonna disappear into Mexico.
You knew?
Agent Mack elway, you have shamed and vilified this bureau...... with your methods.
I have no choice but to recommend you be suspended...... for a period of six months...... during which you' il undergo a psychological evaluation.
Let the record show that the case against Agent Fran Kulok is pending.
Turn it off!
I guess you guys are never unaccounted for, huh?
This guy reaIly Iikes you.
This is O' Ryan' s room.
Tom.
You got it?
Yeah, I got it.
It' s Agent Kulok.
Can you run this number and ID the subscriber for me?
- Hold on.
Let me get outside, hold on.
Thank you.
Ever see a 50- foot shark?
I' m sorry?
A 50- foot shark.
No.
Doesn' t mean there aren' t any.
Excuse me, sir, did you know him?
The guy with the Torino, O' Ryan, the guy who Iived upstairs?
Why?
Is he dead?
- I don' t know.
- You said "did."
- Is he dead?
- Oh, no.
I misspoke.
You ever seen this before?
It' s a circle with a slash through it.
It' s not a circle.
It' s a zero.
It' s a zero.
And how do you know that?
Did he teII you that?
Why are you whistling?
What does that mean?
Circle with a slash through it.
Have you seen that?
A circle with a slash through it?
Tak e a look.
Have you seen a circle with a slash through it?
Benjamin O' Ryan?
Sir?
Benjamin O' Ryan.
He was here seven years.
We got a trace.
Come on.
Come on.
I' II have a 7 & 7 please.
Got some ID?
It' s in the car.
No one' s asked me for it for a couple of years now.
Nothing personal, honey.
Excuse me...
Fuck you.
Hi.
Turn around.
Turn around!
- FBl.
Excuse me.
Tom.
You got an ID?
- What?
- Raymond Starkey.
- Starkey did this?
- Tom, Starkey' s the guy on the ground.
You son of a bitch...... why are you baiting me?
You want me to see what you see.
You want me to see.
I' m trying to see it.
I' m trying to see it.
- He opens up an old wound.
- What does he want?
- I don' t know.
Maybe he' s got something against Iaw enforcement...... Iike the Zodiac.
You' re welcome, Tom. "
Not FBl.
He' s baiting me.
He wants me.
What does he want?
Okay.
Tom, I want you to take me through this.
Okay.
See if this makes sense to you, okay?
Each of the 45 abduction dates on these faxes correspond...... to one of the GPS coordinates on O' Ryan' s map.
- What about the two bodies we ID' d?
WeIl, Iet' s find the faxes.
Here we go.
Last seen, Trenton, New Jersey.
Okay.
Last seen, Dayton, Ohio.
Found in BrownsviIle, Texas.
So we have two bodies...... that were found 1 000 miles from where they were Iast seen.
- That' s Tucumcari, New Mexico.
- Why blue?
That' s the only city where the date on the fax and the map didn' t correspond.
On O' Ryan' s map, 8- 27.
The only thing we know is there never was a Benjamin O' Ryan, FBl.
He would have made a heII of an agent.
Autopsy reports just arrived for both the new positive IDs.
- Bruises?
- No, they' re burn marks.
We' ve got them here too on our female from Dayton.
And these marks relate to the marks found on Fulcher and Speck how?
There were no burn marks on Speck, Fulcher or Starkey.
And we have no slash- circles here on these bodies.
My office, as soon as someone finds something useful.
I do have a couple other Ieads that I' m foIlowing up on.
- I' m hopefuI they' re gonna pan out.
- Great, thank you.
A professor of criminaI biology, Professor Daitz, just caIled.
He says he' s got time for you on Saturday.
Thank you, Katie.
I was operating under the assumption that O' Ryan was somebody' s fantasy.
He was a student of mine.
That' s his construct, his theory.
He caIled it "Suspect Zero."
Suspect Zero?
He posited a theory that a seriaI kiIler...... could cross the entire country without ever getting caught.
What makes a kiIler catchable?
Patterns, repetition of behaviour.
He imagined someone with no patterns...... no teIltale fetishes, no rituals...... just a random kiIling machine that never Ieaves a clue.
But a seriaI kiIler by definition is condemned to repetition.
WeIl, he is untiI he isn' t.
And this Suspect Zero, is that something that you believe in, doctor?
It' s something O' Ryan believed in.
He swore guys Iike that existed, only we couldn' t see them...... because they didn' t obey the usuaI Iaws, Iike cancer doesn' t...... or the HlV virus that tricks your immune system...... into thinking it isn' t there.
So you' re saying a guy Iike that could exist?
Do you know the definition of a black hole?
Not precisely, no.
It' s a celestiaI body with a gravitationaI force so strong...... that nothing escapes it.
WeIl, then how do you find something you can' t see?
WeIl, it was there and we found it.
In this time and place.
What about a split personality?
Could you have a stone- cold kiIler on one hand...... and a thoughtfuI man with a conscience on the other?
I mean, could O' Ryan...... possibly be this Suspect Zero?
Yeah.
It' s a viable theory.
I mean, the point is, I don' t think you' re gonna know untiI you find O' Ryan.
Point is, I don' t think you' re gonna know until you find O' Ryan.
Just a random killing machine that never leaves a clue.
Everybody inside.
On the double, Iet' s go.
Keep moving.
Girls!
Come in, now.
It' s starting to rain, and I don' t want you out there alone.
Turn around!
- Fran.
- Fran, I need some help.
- You' re so wet.
Are you okay?
Yeah, Fran, I need somebody to talk to.
It' s driving me crazy.
Listen to me.
There' s Speck, a smaIl- town New Mexico traveIling salesman.
I got a Iock on him.
It' s just there' s something missing, and I can' t --
It' s okay.
Why don' t you come in.
Get dressed.
We' re right on the edge of this thing, come on.
Come here.
It' s okay.
You gotta keep calm, okay?
Fran....
I' ve been having these dreams.
I' ve been seeing things again...... and I don' t know what they mean.
Come inside, Tom.
No, I can' t.
I almost have it, Fran.
I' m worried about you.
I love you, Fran.
I love you.
Mrs. Speck, did your husband k eep any chemicals?
Did he have any unusuaI hobbies?
Was he an avid photographer?
- Did he have an interest in sewing?
I' m taking your time.
I' m sorry to ask you these questions.
I' m sorry I don' t have more time, Agent Mackelway, but it' s my PTA day.
I' m sorry.
I should have caIled.
I wish I could' ve helped you.
I' m FBl.
Yeah, I' II bet.
What the heII is that?
We managed to identify the remains of 1 0 of the 21 victims found...... in the attic of Harold A. Speck...... the travelling salesman from Truth or Consequences.
More than half were runaways.
The revelation that Speck was a serial killer...... led us to examine Barney Fulcher...... the victim that Agent Kulok and I found at the All American Diner.
After an extensive search of his home, we found the remains of nine people...... mostly boys between the ages of 9 and 1 4.
The last victim, Raymond Stark ey...... who vanished after his acquittal six months ago, we all know about.
For some reason, this man is identifying and targeting serial killers.
Not necessarily.
We got two other bodies from Santa Fe...... so killers aren' t his only victims.
We don' t know those bodies had anything to do with O' Ryan.
He' s a transient with mentaI iIlness.
He also happens to think he' s a former agent of this bureau.
I want this man apprehended now.
Good afternoon.
Afternoon, officer.
See your driver' s Iicense, sir?
Of course.
Is there a problem?
- Sure.
You mind stepping out of the car, please?
I' m carrying something that could be construed as a weapon.
I' d Iike to hand it over so you won' t think I' m trying to conceaI anything.
What kind of weapon, sir?
A hunting knife, right here on my hip.
On my way to the woods.
My gear' s in the trunk.
I don' t know what the procedure is.
Take the weapon off your hip, place it on the ground, kick it towards me.
Happy to.
What exactly were you planning on hunting?
A 50- foot shark.
- I used to be in Iaw enforcement too.
Of course, that was some years ago now.
Psy ops, strictly classified.
Are you on any type of medication, or have you been drinking today?
- I' m sorry.
I just found myself wondering what was inside that truck.
Sir, I' m gonna ask you to hand me the keys to your vehicle, please.
- Fran?
O' Ryan was here.
Don' t do this again, Tom.
Tom, don' t do this.
Icarus began as a means of gathering military intelligence.
But its applications in the world of law enforcement are proving promising.
The reason you men are sitting here is because you' ve all fit into the profile...... that best suits a remote viewer.
You' ve been selected and evaluated...... based on recurrent symptoms of elevated dream activity...... migraine headaches, tinnitus...... and your psy test results.
Target reference number.
One- seven...... four- six.
Don' t close your eyes.
Don' t think.
Focus on the target.
Everyone is gonna wind up with severe psychological trauma.
You' re high or genius- level intelligence...... unmarried, with no record of long or serious relationships.
- And you' re all obsessive...
Don' t stop the pen from moving.
This girl' s afraid.
She' s afraid.
You' re becoming emotionally entrained with the victim. -- collection process.
It is not meant to be an experience.
You' re gonna help me.
You' re gonna help me turn it off.
Nobody' s told us how to turn it off...... and you' re gonna help me turn it off.
You' re gonna help me.
You' re gonna help me.
Turn it off.
Icarus began as a means of gathering military intelligence...... but its applications in the world of law enforcement...... are proving promising in several different areas.
These are areas which you will be inv olved in your studies...... and, as you' ve been advised, they' re classified top- secret and confidential.
FBI profile 6 7 65031.
Icarus case number 7 54.
Physicians in charge, Dr. Galin J. Peterson...... and Dr. Ferdinand Kov oskis.
Audio enhancer for remote viewer O' Ryan.
Session to commence in...... five, four...... three, two...... one.
Focus.
Target number, write it now.
Focus.
One target at a time.
Stay objective.
Do not identify with the victim.
Do not identify with the victim.
Charlie?
Charlie?
Charlie!
Here they are, Mackelway.
Look.
No, I won' t tell!
No, please!
Shut it off for me!
You got one of those pins in Deming?
O' Ryan was spotted there yesterday.
He took a squad car and a sidearm off a highway patrolman.
About an hour Iater a 5- year- old boy was abducted a mile up the interstate.
We also found the bodies of two females in a Dumpster off the highway.
Your boy' s been busy.
We' re establishing a perimeter around the city.
- What' s the difference?
The girls in the Dumpster had fataI injuries.
He' s chasing the guy or that patrolman would be dead.
Can I ship this guy back to DaIlas?
O' Ryan was FBl, you ever heard of a project caIled Icarus?
It' s agents trained to see distant Iocations...... using only the mind.
They caII it remote viewing.
They use it to track down seriaI kiIlers.
What?
It' s buIlshit?
It worked.
That' s how he drew this.
He' d never been in this house...... he just saw what was there.
The bureau taught him...... and he' s using it to track Suspect Zero.
I' m extremely tired of that term.
Profile the guy.
He' s working Iike we would.
He' s not kidnapping, he' s chasing the guy...... that' s doing the kidnapping.
Okay.
What you' re teIling me is aII these abductions are the work of one guy.
Yes.
Mac, do you realize how insane that is?
Fran, please help me.
He' s not Iistening to me.
Tom, I' m not sure that you' re seeing things very clearly right now.
Tom...... Iet' s just try something that actuaIly makes sense.
He picks off three scumbags.
So that we' II think what you' re thinking, that we got a friend.
Somebody who' s wiIling to take out the trash for us, and it' s horseshit.
What if there is a Suspect Zero, and O' Ryan' s the one guy who' s got a shot?
When did you start buying into this guy?
WeIl, he' s smarter than we are.
Speak for yourself.
I' m going to Deming.
You can take the rest of the day off.
- Kulok here.
- I' m headed towards Tucumcari.
Listen, those marks on the bodies, could they be freezer burns?
Let me get into this.
There' s crystaIlization because the blood never clotted.
Freezer burn.
He keeps the bodies in a freezer and buries them 1 000 miles apart?
- Hey, Tom, what' s going on?
- I got a possible suspect.
Are you afraid?
It' d be custom here at this point to start praying.
You' re alone.
Come on.
Are you afraid?
Must be extremely satisfying to hear yourself say something so heroic.
I' m almost envious.
The boy' s in pieces under the bed.
Now are you afraid?
I know what you' re thinking, "Pain is coming.
WiII I take it Iike a man. "
Let me put you at ease, you won' t.
Men, women, children, they aII weep, they aII beg.
They pass out, piss themselves, attempt negotiations.
You wouldn' t believe how many men I' ve seen where you are.
Grown men with wives and children at home...... offering sexuaI gratification for a five- minute reprieve.
Are you afraid?
When they realize there' s nothing Ieft to negotiate, and they' re helpIess....
WeIl, the Iook in their eyes, the IeveI of surrender...... it' s almost pornographic.
I put that mirror here because I didn' t want you to miss it.
Are you afraid?
- Look in the mirror.
- Look in the mirror.
- Hey, you, fucking Mackelway.
- Are you afraid, Mackelway?
- Look at yourself.
- No, I' m not afraid.
Open your eyes!
-... or I' II cut the fucking Iids off!
- Then cut the fucking Iids off!
The initiation used to be more civil.
I' m sorry about that.
You' re part of it now.
There were five of us, you know.
The most skiIled...... technicaI remote viewers on Project Icarus.
You come in in the morning, have a cup of coffee, talk about the Yankees.
You go to your room with your pen...... and your pad of paper, always alone.
You try and Iock in, you crank out an ideogram.
Son of Sam, John Wayne Gacy, Ted Bundy.
He might be driving his car, having a beer, brushing his teeth...... cutting someone' s eyes out.
If you did it right, you got it aIl.
The way it sounded, the way it smeIled.
Those people were Iooking right up at you, begging you for mercy.
But, of course, you' re not God.
Can' t do a thing for them.
They wired us into this current, the five of us...... darkness, the pit itself.
We were plugged right into it, and no one taught us how to turn it off.
We saw things men shouldn' t see.
Agony...... torture...... evil.
It never shut off.
I checked once with aII the guys that' d...... been on the project when it was just used for intel.
You know, finding gun- runners and drug Iords, Soviet missile sites...... even the Iran hostages.
Anyway, I checked with them, and they' re aII okay.
But the five of us...... plugged into the brains and nervous systems of human beings...... that' s when we Iost it.
We' re aII either dead or institutionalised.
After a while, those conversations about the Yankees became impossible.
O' Ryan.
Those faxes...... the missings...... how many of them are his?
AII of them.
You were the missing piece, Mac.
Now everything is in place.
AII you have to do is finish it.
This is Mackelway.
I' m traveIling north, approaching I- 54 at Tucumcari, request backup.
I' m pursuing a possible suspect in a refrigerated truck.
Brake!
- Tom!
- Get the trailer open!
There' s a kid in the trailer.
You okay?
I got you, okay?
Okay, come here.
- Yes, ma' am.
No.
No, that wasn' t me.
Of course it was you.
Wasn' t the wind.
You beat him to death.
Now aII you have to do is finish it.
Understand, none of this was arbitrary.
It' s not a bad start, Mac.
You made the world a Iittle safer.
- This wasn' t justice.
And so is this.
I' m not going to kiII you, O' Ryan.
You already have.
I' ve seen it a thousand times.
- No, you saw wrong.
- That' s impossible!
I saw us here.
Me baiting you, testing you!
Look at him!
You' ve arrived!
You' re cursed, Iike me...... only you keep running from it!
You hear things, you see things...... that' s why you can' t sleep.
Get up.
Get up.
There is no Zero.
You' re confused, old man.
You think we did something mythicaI here today?
You think we put an end to evil?
We kiIled a deviant, that' s aIl.
There are thousands of them out there.
O' Ryan, you' re a guy with a skiIl.
You' re not God.
You don' t decide what' s justice.
Freeze!
Please, Mac.
I can' t sleep anymore.
I keep seeing aII those faces.
The ones I couldn' t save.
AII those missings.
You know, they never blink.
They' re aII in here.
I want you to shut it off for me.
Please, Mac, I' m so tired.
Shut it off for me.
I can' t.
I' m not you.
Yet.
So tired.
So tired.
Thank you.
