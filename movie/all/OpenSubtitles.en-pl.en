Madeleine, can we buy some milk from you?
One quart.
Take it off the top so there' s lots of cream.
Thanks.
The same, but with more cream.
Thanks.
It' s a shame.
Such a nice girl.
Imagine not being able to talk.
Completely mute.
No wonder, after what happened.
Such a sweet, young girl.
It must be 15 years ago by now.
And the old man who raped her got off scot- free.
They said he was insane.
Not responsible for his actions.
But it sure is strange the girl can' t talk.
The doctor said it was because of the trauma.
Some kind of mental block.
Madeleine.
You better hurry if you want to catch the 4: 00 bus.
You haven' t had any time off for a month.
Can you give me a single reason not to come to town with me?
Hi, my name is Tony.
Got this car today.
Isn' t she a beauty?
A 3000 GTO.
157 horses.
Goes from zero to 100 in 8 1/ 2 seconds.
Max speed just over 200.
You buy the hottest car in town, but still the best is missing.
A chick to drive around with.
Would you like something to eat?
It' s on the company.
We' il start with cheese and herring... followed by the pepper steak flambé.
Figs in cognac flambé.
Red wine, and Akvavit with the herring... and some champagne to start.
I like women who don' t talk too much... but you set a new record.
Welcome.
May I take your coat?
Thanks.
Won' t you sit down?
I' il get something to drink.
Cheers.
You aren' t drinking.
It won' t kill you.
Just good stuff.
Cheers.
Hello, nurse?
It' s Tony.
Is the doctor in?
Thanks, that' s kind of you.
Hi, it' s Tony.
A new prospect.
110 pounds.
A real beginner.
How much will we need?
Can you bring the shots immediately?
She' s sound asleep now.
Sure, great.
See you.
Hi, it' s Tony.
In ten days I' il have a fine new chick ready.
How about that?
The fifth this year.
Soon we can close up and retire to Switzerland.
That' s great.
So long.
Good to see you, Sam.
Here' s our patient.
She needs a little stimulation.
Just sign your name.
Sign the duplicate too.
No need to read it.
Just sign it.
Where the hell are you going?
There you are... my love.
Now, here' s the situation.
You have become hooked on heroin... which isn' t like your ordinary amphetamines.
It' s the toughest narcotic in existence.
You' re hooked both physically and psychologically... and you' il die in 48 hours if you don' t get a fix.
But we' re not going to have any trouble, are we?
Do as I say and you' il get your two shots a day.
{y: i} "I never want... {y: i} to see you again.
{y: i} Because you never understood.
{y: i} You never understood {y: i} how much I hated that terrible farm.
{y: i} How your protective instincts {y: i} suffocated me.
I have found a wonderful man who has given my life meaning.
I' m doing everything to forget my horrible time with you.
I hope you' il forget about me quickly.
You' il never see me again... because I never want to see you again.
Signed, Madeleine. "
Well, my little friend, now life really begins.
You' il get two of these a day if you do as I say.
Your first visitor arrives at 1: 00.
No mistakes, or you' il go without.
Now, let' s have a look at your room.
The accountant is arriving soon.
Be nice to him.
Hi, sweetheart.
Take off your clothes.
Tony!
What the hell?
Goddamn it!
What kind of bitches do you have here?
How can I go home to my wife with my face looking like this?
Damn it!
I' m gonna scar her for life.
I' m doing great.
How about you?
What?
The pirate?
Tuesday?
The pirate is available between 2: 00 and 4: 00.
But the price has gone up.
Yeah, she' s more than Sally.
Is that okay?
Great.
My pleasure.
Thank you.
This is how it is from now on.
You' re on your own.
Every morning at 9: 00, you' il get a list from me with names of customers and times they' il arrive.
You' il get two packets so you can make it through the day.
Monday' s your day off.
On Sunday you' il get four packets so you can make it through Tuesday.
If you behave, you' il get a percentage of the profits.
That' s fair, isn' t it?
Here' s today' s list.
In half an hour you start with Mr. Andersson.
What?
That' s right.
I almost forgot.
Get undressed.
My name' s Sally.
You poor thing.
The beginning' s the worst.
You feel so sick you wanna die.
The only thing that keeps you going is the dependency on dope.
If you go without for too long, then you really start feeling things.
Goddamn!
I tried to leave here once.
I ran back to my little town.
To Mom.
But I fell apart.
I thought I' d die.
Tony sent two thugs to get me.
Horrible bastards.
They' il do anything for a couple of grand.
After those guys, being back here seemed all right.
At the most you' il last 30- 36 hours without getting a new hit.
After that, it' s over.
You get paranoid.
Then you die, unless you get another hit.
But I' ve got a plan of my own to fall back on.
I hit up all the johns for additional loot.
For a bit of extra service.
In a year I' il have enough to take off for Switzerland.
There' s a rehab clinic there for drug addicts.
It takes four months before you' re cured.
But it takes dough.
Around 60, 000 for the entire treatment.
I should be able to leave in about a year.
I get this way sometimes.
I can' t help it.
Hey, I saw Tony had a letter for you.
I took it when he wasn' t looking.
{y: i} What a terrible letter {y: i} we received today.
{y: i} How can our little Madeleine... {y: i} be so full of hate?
What did we do wrong?
What we did wrong you could have set right.
Now we have nothing to live for.
We are tormented by the fact that our little Madeleine... is so full of hate.
After all these terrible disappointments... your father and I only want to tell you... not to worry.
You will never see us again.
Madeleine... you were our everything.
The sunshine of our lives.
Good- bye.
{y: i} The doctor said it was poison... but I wonder where it came from.
It seems awfully strange they were the only ones poisoned.
A lot of people bought milk that day.
Well, I wonder.
You don' t pour poison in your milk by mistake.
I still wonder if it wasn' t...
Sure, after those terrible letters the girl wrote her parents.
Terrible letters.
I read the last one.
They took it really hard.
So, you want to learn how to drive faster than the average guy.
Half of this will do.
This is a model 96 rifle, also called a Mauser.
It was used in both world wars.
If you lie down... a little further back.
There.
Hold it against your shoulder, because it has a good kick.
Hold it steady.
To load, lower the weapon.
Pull the bolt up, then back, and then insert the cartridge.
Push down and move the bolt forward.
Then bring the gun up against your shoulder.
Make sure you keep it steady against your shoulder.
Place your finger on the trigger and gently squeeze off a shot.
Reload.
Check your shoulder.
Now aim and squeeze.
You' il have a visitor today who' s never been here before.
Take good care of --
This is Tony.
Oh, hi there.
Good, as usual.
Sorry, what did you say?
The 2 4th?
Let' s have a look.
She' s just great, as usual.
Step back.
You' re striking too quickly.
Sink down and strike hard.
That' s better.
Step back.
Now look.
If you' re coming into a curve like this... and you start to skid... you have to steer into the skid.
Steer into it like this until you come out of it here.
Then you floor it.
Wait here.
I have a present for you.
An extra hit.
By the way, Sally' s gone.
She won' t be back.
Got another job in Beirut.
That' s her business.
Hope it works out well for her.
I can' t teach you anymore.
I' il be damned!
All bull' s- eyes.
Hell, you want that much?
You want a powerful one?
I need two more bills.
You got a car too.
Three beers.
We' ve got trouble.
Madeleine shot a customer.
She may be after you too.
I got you two tickets to Spain.
Get lost until things cool off.
Yeah, it' s me.
Come over right away.
I have a rush job for you.
What?
Right, 10, 000 a head.
Hurry up, damn it!
Great.
Bye.
Hello?
What?
Axelsson?
You' re scared?
Think how I feel!
Hell, no!
She' s gone nuts.
Completely mad.
No, of course I' ve closed the shop.
She has to return soon to get a fix.
Take my advice and go out to the country until this is over.
What?
No problem.
Someone' s just come in.
Bye.
I' m glad you got here so fast.
Madeleine shot two of her customers.
Set a trap for her and then take her for a drive.
She is not to be found again.
I' m out.
There' s nothing left.
I' m completely cleaned out.
I know somebody.
The hot dog man in the harbor.
Go there.
{y: i} Car 411.
{y: i} This is 411, over.
{y: i} We have shots fired in the harbor.
{y: i} Warehouse three.
41 1, I read you.
Over and out.
Drop your weapon.
She' s totally nuts.
She' s challenged me to a duel.
I get to choose the weapons.
She should be in a nuthouse.
Now she' s gonna get what' s coming to her.
I' il get her once and for all.
Madeleine, what the hell are you doing?
Put down the gun, and let' s talk about this.
It' s just a misunderstanding.
What kind of nonsense is this?
Put down the rifle.
Madeleine, please.
You fucking whore!
Thought you could fool me, huh?
Damn slut!
Which knee should I blow away first?
Fucking whore!
Gun!
Go!
Move it.
Get out of here!
Jesus, Billy!
Come on, Axel.
Watch yourself.
Anybody in there?
What the fuck is going on here?
- Whoever it was got away clean.
What are you doing here?
I ran a check.
There is no Johnny Wishbone.
You' re illegal.
Who the hell are you and why are you here?
I' m a cop.
I didn' t say before cos I knew you' d be upset.
It' s a Detroit badge.
Why are you in Beverly Hills?
Federal task force on organised crime, and my code name is Wishbone.
I' m the Chief of Police here, if there' s a Federal task force, I want to know!
You can call back to Detroit tomorrow and ask for an lnspector Todd.
He' il tell you all about it.
My real name is Axel Foley.
Call there between nine and ten, Detroit time, he' il tell you.
Right now, I have the rest of my case to finish, so excuse me.
And you two, what the hell were you doing here?
- We' re off duty, sir.
I' il have you both investigated and suspended!
Technically, this is traffic duty.
Technically, you' re a goddamn idiot.
Get out of here, Taggart!
- Jesus Christ...
- Yeah.
This is Wild Kingdom.
I tried to create a stress- free environment.
You have.
These are my friends.
He' s a wandering jew.
This is Mona.
Hi, baby.
They actually like different kinds of music.
lf I play the Beatles, the begonias perk up.
lf I play Beethoven, they wither.
- Who' s this?
Big Al.
Had him about six years.
lsn' t he great?
- James Brown.
- ls that turtle shit in there?
- What are you doing?
I' m curious to know where his dick is at.
Give me him.
- How' s it hanging, Big Al?
- Billy' s pretty fucked up.
- I know.
I was joking!
Give me the super glue.
- The Dating Game.
Let' s give Billy a big Dating Game kiss.
- Where, in the alligator pit?
Jesus, Billy.
- Jeff?
- Axel, it' s one in the morning.
Jeffrey, stop talking.
How' s the Ferrari?
What a great car!
Do those seats go back?
I was with Marcy trying to get the seats back...
You can' t do freaky shit in that car.
- Am I going to get in trouble?
It' s not weird.
It' s simple.
The fumes from the super glue attach to the acid from the fingerprints.
It' s a street cop trick.
- We could use the computer downtown.
There won' t be anybody there this time of night, Sarge.
Shit.
- Really.
Come on.
You boys definitely get an A in High- tech.
It takes 60 cops to do this shit in Detroit.
Charles Cain.
Used to be Charles Campos.
I just met this guy.
He works in the Beverly Hills Gun Club.
- He does?
- That' s his print.
This guy had nothing to do with Bogomil getting shot.
lf he suspected him, he would' ve picked him up.
Let' s put an APB out on Cain.
We can' t.
All we got is fingerprints.
- Let' s go to the Gun Club.
Wait.
It' s 1 1: 00.
- So?
A big mistake.
It' s against the law.
Once we cross the line, there' s no way back.
I' il go.
See?
Would you lighten up and take some risks?
Fuck it.
Let' s go.
Alarm tape.
- There are ways around alarm tape.
lf we open this door, the connection will break between the magnets.
lf we use this foil, and you squeeze it between the two magnets, then take your gum to hold it in place...
Now the magnets have the illusion that the connection' s not broken.
Then we take our knife...
Open the door without...
We walk in without the alarm going off.
You' ve done that before.
I wasn' t always a police officer, I fractured a law or two as a kid.
- It' s my last one.
Split it.
None for you.
- A needle in a haystack.
Give me some light over here.
Shit.
Here you go.
What the hell is that?
That knife.
- Billy, we got to talk.
- Yeah.
- A needle in a haystack.
Map coordinates?
ls this lnspector Todd of the Detroit Police?
It is.
I' m sorry to be bothering you, my name is Lionel Hand,
- Thanks.
Don' t touch the leather.
- This is short notice, but could you meet me this morning for breakfast at my office?
I' il be there.
Thank you.
My pleasure.
Ring.
Here' s your coffee, sir.
- Yes, sir.
Come on, come on...
Damn it, who tricked my ass?
- Don' t confuse me when I' m dialling.
- That' s what I said.
This is Harold Lutz.
I' m chief of the Beverly Hills Police Department.
Do you have an officer Axel Foley...
Yes, he' s under my command, but he' s assigned to some multi- jurisdictional, Federal task force.
I never know where the hell he is.
It' s a real pain.
I can' t control him.
He reports directly to the Feds.
I have to go.
What the hell are you doing in here?
- You damn right it isn' t.
I want to see if these coordinates intercept.
What makes you think they mean anything?
- What' s City Deposit?
It' s where banks take their money.
I bet that' s the next place that gets hit.
Unit 22, assist.
City Deposit, 341 Gregory.
Unable to verify.
Can' t this car go any faster?
Come on.
I got it.
Out of the hole.
Move it.
Let' s do it.
Here we go.
Two, one...
Three minutes!
- No way!
Where' s the seat belt?
- It' s green!
- It was yellow!
2: 30.
Some kind of construction.
- I' m coming!
Don' t wait for me.
Two minutes.
What' s that for?
After the club shootout, I figured I needed more firepower.
We got to talk.
Who do you think you are?
Dirty Rosewood?
1: 30.
Sound the alarm.
You got a break- in.
I need authorisation.
- Fuck!
Get out of here!
Come on!
Go!
Go!
Get out!
Go!
Rosewood, get some wheels.
- It' s all I could find.
Police business!
I need your car!
I' m a police officer!
God.
Here I go again.
Come on, let' s go!
- I know the guy.
He' s a jerk!
- I' m steering!
- I haven' t tried them.
I' m sure we should have went left.
Fuck!
Are you driving with your eyes open, or are you using the Force?
Stop!
There' s the truck.
Now what?
- Let' s follow it.
- Billy, isn' t this...
What the fuck is up?
Check this out.
I get $10 for cars, I get $20 for limos.
What the hell is this?
My truck.
Here' s $50.
Put it next to a limo.
- Your name?
Today it' s dirty.
Somebody made a mistake in the pool.
What do you mean by "mistake"?
- There' s something floating in it.
- I see...
You write names down, I clean pools.
Where' s the pool at?
Who are these gentlemen with you?
The Board of Health.
They' re making sure I do the job thoroughly.
- Excuse me.
Jesus Christ!
Wake up!
Look alive.
You may never see it again.
I don' t want to step on your tongues.
Why aren' t my parties like this?
You got to die sometime.
Might as well be here.
- How are we supposed to find them?
- The big bitch.
Max!
How' d you get in here?
Forget I asked.
I see how, it' s the suit.
- May I see your invitation?
It' s Max.
- Are we having a problem?
Axel Foley!
I feel like I know you already cos I put your magazine up...
Forget it.
Here' s some background on your guests.
This is Thomopolis, he' s into guns and drugs.
And this is Max, and Max kills cops for a living.
- I happen to be a major contributor.
We appreciate it.
Goodbye.
He appreciates it, Max, but take your ass home.
You outdone your welcome.
But it' s been real, it' s been nice.
Everybody, party' s over!
Max fucked it up for everybody, so let' s just go home.
We' il go ahead as planned.
Get Cain to prepare E.
- I told y' all I wasn' t always a cop.
Yeah, you fractured an occasional law as a kid.
This is not good.
See?
Every now and then, an occasional long shot pays off.
Dent' s accountant, Sidney Bernstein.
Anything Dent' s into, he' il have a record.
We' il visit him tomorrow.
It' s all we got to go on.
There' s no B and D, I' m looking for something.
And what about that cement truck?
Talk to me!
The cement truck was a tactical decoy.
A decoy?
A diversion to protect the criminals' getaway.
That' s why it rammed the police car.
Have you submitted yourself for drug testing yet?
I want you in by Thursday.
Understand?
- Putz.
- He called you Putz.
No, I called you a putz.
He' s right.
Putz.
You, Mr Scribbler...
- Remains to be seen.
He doesn' t like you very much.
Do you hear this insubordination?
Yes, and I' ve never heard such abuse.
Whatever' s happened, the fact remains that the robbery was foiled and the money was saved.
lf I were you, I' d concentrate on cracking this code and determining where the E crime will be.
There' s not many targets beginning with E, so find them.
- Mayor!
Yes, Mayor.
And you!
I want you out of here!
Get out of here, you degenerate!
You' re not even part of this department!
- Out.
You' re not going to make it.
We started this together, we' il finish together.
Check if Bernstein owns a car.
Give me a pen.
Give me a pen!
'86 Mercedes.
License number CRL 507.
Naturally, I can see...
I mean, I understand.
Somebody...
Wait...
Come right in!
Don' t let the fact that my door' s closed dissuade you from entering my office.
Beverly Hills Police.
- You have 25 unpaid tickets.
- I pay all my tickets.
Do you own a black Mercedes- Benz, license plate number CRL 507?
- You have 25 tickets.
It' s under my name, but it' s my wife' s car!
No, no, no!
Bitch!
These tickets haven' t been paid.
Can you cuff Mr Bernstein?
There are people out there with chainsaws!
You have unpaid tickets and it' s your car.
We' re taking you in.
Wait.
I' ve got an idea. ls there something that I have in this office that I could hand to you and that would make you kind of forget that you' re holding those little pink tickets there?
What are you saying?
You' d have something in that hand and this hand you' d forget about.
That hand you' d go, "What did I have there?
I don' t remember. "
- Ouch!
Please, I' m robbing you.
That' s what I' m doing.
Here' s one, here' s two.
They' re real crisp.
No problem at all.
Certainly.
Also, one other thing.
- Could you excuse me while I...
Yeah, it' s secretive.
It' s like a James Bond thing!
- No problem!
- I can' t believe...
Jan, Axel.
How you doing?
What do you got?
Strange.
Before 1978, everything' s blank.
It' s classified, but its policy date is 197 4.
I found something interesting in our foreign office in London.
Dent was the cultural attaché to the East German embassy in Honduras.
- That' s his biggest business.
But from these records, seems like Dent' s in trouble.
He' s let his insurance lapse on everything in the last six months.
- Which one is that?
Empyrean Fields.
He' s got a huge policy on that one.
Good, good, good, good, good.
- When your father wakes up...
Tell him you found his man.
Bye- bye.
Empyrean Fields.
- What was in the files?
Dent' s visa application had today' s date on it.
lf we don' t step on it, he' s gone.
- I don' t know.
That' s why I need you to go along personally to make certain nothing goes wrong.
I' m on the team, of course.
I broke it.
You son of a bitch.
- "Chinguen sus puercos, Carlos."
Screw you cops.
Signed, Carlos.
- Pigs.
Another word for cops.
Wait a minute, Carlos?
It is Cain.
Carlos is Spanish for Charles.
Cain changed his name.
- I ain' t said that.
The first code was very hard.
This is easy.
Whoever did this wanted the cops to get it.
- He fractured an occasional law.
The horses have now reached the starting gate.
Freeze!
Hit the floor!
Freeze, goddamn it!
1: 30.
1: 15.
30 seconds.
Time!
Goodbye, Mr Cain.
- Our horse didn' t come in.
The result is now official.
The winner, Johnny' s Dilemma...
- Police!
We' re a little late.
All I can tell you now is that we are confident that we have identified the Alphabet Bandit.
The man was shot dead at the scene this morning by security guard Jack Stiles.
ln his latest robbery attempt, the man was fatally wounded.
So I give you my oath right here there will be no F crime.
My computer team cracked the Alphabet Bandit' s code this afternoon.
Carlos, which, as you all know, is Spanish for Charles.
- Where' s Dent?
- Where' d you get that?
It' s coming from there.
Excuse me.
How did the mud get on the horse?
- There.
Dent' s oil field.
Bogomil had that red mud on his sneakers.
- Dent' s going broke, OK?
So he heists some bank, heists some jewellery, then throws this easy code with Cain' s name on it.
Simple.
You frame Cain, kill Cain,
Cain' s the Alphabet killer, Dent gets away scot- free.
Why would an oil man risk this, even if he was broke?
- Why not split with the cash?
- I don' t see oil.
I see trucks.
Come on, Billy.
Billy, what are you doing?
I' ve been wanting to wear this for a while.
Are you nuts?
Billy, we have got to talk.
What the hell is this?
- Shit.
Bogomil was here.
- Yeah.
I' m from the Rap Coalition of America.
Throw that gun over there.
- Smile.
Let' s rap together.
- It looks like World War ill.
Here, Billy.
You don' t have one of these, do you?
You guys hang around the back, I' il check out the front.
- Element of surprise.
What?
Are you nuts?
Fool the connecting wire into thinking it' s still intact.
These documents will make your life much easier.
You need to sign them.
You still got that thing?
It' s a bad idea.
Of all the ideas you had, this is the worst.
- Trust me.
Come on, Axel!
Get him!
Get your head down!
- "Extend."
"Release safety."
Aim through there, push this.
Fuck Rambo.
Get me the fuck out of here.
- Go, Axel!
- Hold it!
- Freeze!
All right!
Lay your weapons down!
Mr Foley.
You involved yourself in business that doesn' t concern you.
That was a mistake.
Goodbye, Mr Foley.
Women.
Come on, let' s go.
- Police!
- I think they know that, Billy.
Drop your weapons!
- What took you guys so long?
Shit.
We' re in trouble now.
Axel' s AWOL.
We can get out of this if we keep quiet.
Don' t say anything.
What the hell have you done here?
Looks like a goddamn war zone.
What have you done, Taggart?
We solved the Alphabet crimes.
Shut up.
Who the hell is talking to you?
I solved the Alphabet case over an hour ago.
And you!
- Chief...
- Will you just listen a minute?
You shut up!
This is what the Alphabet crimes are about... guns!
That guy sold them, then bought them with stolen money from Adriano' s at his own racetrack.
He was going to Central America.
lf you' d take your head out of your ass, you' d see we solved the whole thing!
Lutz, why didn' t I know about this?
Chief Lutz doesn' t have the guts to hear the truth.
We had to go undercover with Foley to solve this case.
- Yeah?
- Kiss mine!
You' re fired, too!
Lutz, I' ve had it with your abusive attitude.
I' m sorry.
I get carried away.
- Don' t overreact, Ted.
I want you out of here now.
- You' il regret this, Ted.
You too.
You' re out of here.
- You bet.
I' ve got a charity meeting for the homeless for Beverly Hills.
I' d like to make a donation.
Here' s $200 from Sidney Bernstein.
That' s my alias.
I don' t like publicity.
Thank you, Axel...
- Thank you, sir.
"Kiss my ass"?
You' re getting more like me every day.
Big dicks and all.
- Right.
You are the new chief?
lnspector Todd?
Ted Egan, mayor of Beverly Hills.
I told your mayor we' re very thankful you allowed Foley to help us.
He says he' s acquired all his skills under your expert tutelage.
Certainly.
He' s just arrived.
Expert tutelage?
What the fuck have you been saying?
Let me talk to him.
Now that you' re done being a California hero, get your ass home to your real job.
I' m leaving now.
My ass left already.
I got to catch up with it.
One other thing, your secret partner Mario Andretti Friedman wrecked the goddamn Ferrari.
Here, you talk to Jeffrey.
Axel, it wasn' t my fault.
There was a bus coming...
Hello?
He hung up.
Hello?
- Fishing' s too tiring.
It' s back to Detroit for some old- fashioned street violence.
Come with me.
Your wife left you.
Come hang out.
- Did she?
Congratulations.
The people you least expected, they' re studs.
- Her mother didn' t have cable TV.
Your cable brought her back.
- Thanks a lot, Axel.
Don' t thank me.
I love you guys.
- Be cool, man.
Anything we can do for you?
Yeah.
Take care of my uncle' s house till he gets back.
Axel, that' s not really your uncle' s house, is it?
Yeah.
Trust me.
What the hell' s going on?
Who are you?
Who' s that black guy?
ENGLlSH
Yeah he- he!
I- I- I mean, rules are like... arbitrary, you know.
Made up for people who believe in fairy tales like... you know, like... like Santa Claus.
Hey, but not us, right?
I mean, we know what' s important.
There' s a war going on, man.
A war!
Ain' t that a bitch?
I just graduated today, man.
With honours.
Got my degree in... in pharmacology.
I' m licensed.
Look, if you write me up on this drug charge, I won' t be able to practise.
So what we' re talking about here is... is my life.
The rest of it.
The '60s are over,... man.
Boom sha lock lock boom!
lf I was a Jew, then I' d light a menorah
Just assume the position, I' il take my rod and then I' il go fishin '
I' il get your river flowin '
Blade
Jody and Nick, you have come together in this church so that the Lord may seal...
Is it true this is the biggest deal you' ve cut with the FBl?
I now pronounce you man and wife.
(Phone rings) - Aren' t you supposed to be in court?
Case adjourned.
They just seemed to run fresh out of witnesses.
Ah, frees up The Lizard for his other business.
100 large has been deducted from your account as promised
Can The Lizard offer a suggestion on how she can er..... work off the rest of her debt?
The Lizard may not.
Go.
Believe me, you' il thank me later.
Let' s go.
No more free meals.
Let' s go.
Christ!
It' s like a reptile house in here.
Fuck off!
Ah.
Mix- Master.
To our star chemist, gentlemen.
Elmo McElroy.
Where' s Durant?
I see five.
I don' t see the Brit.
Where the fuck is he at?
He said he' d be here.
Limey faggot needs a lesson in manners.
Fuck Durarnt
Just tell us about this new wonder drug.
Get your master chemist in here.
OK.
Konokko, fetch him.
Fetch The Lizard? s Elmo
No Durant... no McElroy.
Maybe he went out for something.
Nobody goes out for something on deal day!
Now, stop your whining, get up off your ass and go find him!
Now!
Argh!
Just give me a moment
This s Elmo McEroy' s phone He' s not home
Bye
Tasty Drops?
He fucked me!
I' m truly ass- invaded!
You have one new message
He fucked me I' m truly ass- invaded!
Rest in peace..... motherfucker.
You' re going home Dakota
- I' m going to Vegas.
- You stern to me
There' s this limey asshole in Liverpool named Durarnt
He was supposed to show up for this little deal we had going on today.
He didn' t show up.
The Lizard thinks he stoke his Elmo
I' m not going back.
I don' t care how much I owe you.
Listen to me Dakota
I want this limey motherfucker Durant off the fucking planet and I want fucking Elmo fucking McElroy
- off the fucking planet!
- Did you hear what just sad?
That place has nothing to offer me.
The Lizard..... will wipe your marker clean.
Plus a bonus 100. 000 if the job is done in 48 hours.
And after that, there is nothing to stop you from turning right around and leaving again.
250.
Get it done.
It' s done.
Shite!
would like to extend a very warm welcome to each of you on behalf of all the crew on this Virgin Atlantic flight
Pease store carry- on baggage
Can I show you to your seat, sir?
Spit it out.
Spit it out now!
Tommy?
What?
What?
(Liverpudlian accent) Fuckn 'Yanks
The trouble with the fuckin 'Yanks is, they' ve no fuckin' sense.
Had some dick in Los Angeles actually ask me where I learnt English.
English?
Fuck!
Do you have a problem with America, Felix?
Oh, yeah.
I' ve got one great big, fat, swollen fucker of a problem with America, twat!
Listen to this.
I' m in fuckin 'Florida, right?
This Southern prat comes up and he' s like er...
"Hey, England' s small.
You must know that John fuckin 'Smith guy, right? "
(Camptown Races ringtone)
I' m like:
Oh, yeah, yeah, mate, that' s right.
John Smith.
Yeah, I do know him but he doesn' t come from England, mate.
No, he comes from fuckin '
Pricksville, USA!
- You going to answer the fuckin 'phone or what?
- It' s just my wife.
Now, when Mr. McElroy joins us, I' d be pleased if you kept your opinions to yourself.
This particular Yank is not a travelling salesman.
He' s a genius, hmm?
Who is this cunt?
So I said to Mr. Durant, I said, "Mr. Durant, we go and meet this fuckin 'Yank McElroy, bring him to the deal and that' s it."
None of this fuckin 'conversation- and- coffee bollocks.
None of this asking him how the Tampa Bay 'Eers are doing.
No, I said, "Fuck him.
I bring him to the deal, I get my fuckin 'tickets and I' m off.
That' s it. "
- Take a left up here - There' s no time for this.
Take a fuckin 'left!
Felix!
Felix, listen!
This is a totally new chemical.
Once we have the formula, we could make this stuff in a kitchen.
We don' t even need Durant.
Look.
You see that?
That' s tomorrow.
Blokes are shagging their mothers- in- law to get a ticket and I' m getting two from Mr. Durant.
So unless you can shite out a couple of tickets on the spot,
I suggest you shut the fuck up.
But this is a unique window of opportunity for you.
- We are talking telephone numbers!
- Ah, enough.
Take care of him.
He' s gettng on my fuckn 'tits
We' re going to be ate boss
Fuck the Yank.
Let him wait.
When you walk...
Through a storm
Hold your head up high
Glory, glory, Man United
Glory, glory, Man United
Glory, glory, Man United
And the Reds go marching on, on, on!
Boys and girls of Manchester!
- Just popped over from er... Liverpool...
- Fuckin 'wanker!.. to invite you to a game of footy tomorrow.
What the fuckin 'hell' s that, you twat?
But I' m fuckin 'fucked if you pricks are going to win it.
Come on, then, mate.
Keep up the spirit.
Someone get that fucking thing out!
Young man, get off the bloody green!
- Where the fuck have you been?
- Round the block.
Drive, quick!
Let' s go meet the Yankee muppet.
Where' s Lawrence?
Where' s he gone?
We' re late.
- Well, he' s...
- You left him at the pub.
- But you said...
- Go back.
Go back and get him.
Look at this wanker.
- Prick!
- Go on.
Lawrence says, right, he' s going to be carrying..... a load of drugs, right?
We do him.
Job done.
OK?
I' m not having some fuckin 'nig- nog... put us out of business, right?
Hey!
Watch it!
You' re pissin 'on my fuckin' boots!
- What about Felix DeSouza?
He' s a rabid dog.
Is he?
Well, fuck him!
Fuck him!
Leave it to me!
I' il rip out his fuckin 'liver.
Va- voom!
Yeah?
No problem.
No problem.
Hey!
Hey!
Felix DeSouza.
Just the wanker I wanted to deal with.
Deal with this.
What a fuckin 'day.
Arthur.
Come in, Arthur.
Why don' t you try the big fat button, Arthur?
Yes, sir.
Now, we are looking for a large black gentleman wearing a dress.
That' s what Lawrence said.
It should be easy.
Yeah, and we want Customs to pull him over, right?
Wrong.
We want Customs to let him through and you follow him.
- Utter nutbag.
- Right.
What now?
Follow them all.
Over.
- Madam, if you' d like to come this way.
- No.
I' ve got to go.
Have you finished?
CUSTOMS OFFlCER:
Not quit mss need to look at your shoulder bag
Welcome to England.
Actually, that makes me out to be a bit of a liar, cos let' s face it, pal, you' re about as welcome as a dose of the clap.
But it' s always nice to be nice.
- Who the hell are you?
- Felix DeSouza.
Mr. Durant sent me.
- I asked for a chemist.
Where' s Lawrence?
- He should be here.
- I should give a shit.
To me, you' re just a ticket to the game.
Where' s the chemist?
Where' s Lawrence?
You heard him.
Where' s Lawrence?
Put these in the truck.
Get Durant on the phone.
Put these fucking sticks in the boot.
Aaah!
- What' s that?
- It' s Lawrence.
I can see it' s fucking Lawrence.
What happened?
- You told me to take care of him.
I meant to take care of him, not fucking take care of him.
Shit.
Shit.
Shit!
Shut the fucking thing, will you?
Fuck...
Get Durant on the fucking phone, right fucking now!
Where' s my motherfucking chemist?!
- Lawrence?
He should be in the car.
- Should be?!
What kind of fuck- up is this Durarnt?
Look, we deal today, or I go to the competition.
Look, let me speak to DeSouza.
DeSouza?
DeSouza?
Look, boss, it wasn' t my fault.
Besides, he was fucking irritating.
Right now, I couldn' t give a gnat' s chuff.
You twat!
You just make sure McElroy gets here.
Where' s my fucking chemist?! - think we need a new chemist Mr. Durarnt - I know.
I can fucking hear him, can' t I?
Tell him I' m going to get a hold of er...
Pudsey Smith, OK?
I am not buying aspirin for a fucking arm and a leg.
He' s getting Pudsey Smith.
- Who?
- He' s a deaf- mute.
Stall him.
Just stall him.
You keep that Yankee cunt happy.
And alive.
All right, boss.
Yeah.
Oh!
You fucking twat!
What' s the plan, then?
Freshen up?
Massage?
Maybe you fancy a bucket of fried fucking chicken.
If I wanted cuisine, I' d have gone to Paris.
You can still go to France.
It' s not too far.
It' s full of pricks and they hate fucking Yanks too.
Do you fancy a bite?
All right.
Hello, stranger!
Said hello to lover boy yet?
- (Laughs) - Iki, I' m in a hurry.
Can we get on with it?
Ruger mini- 14, 223 calibre.
It comes in a fetching chrome.
20 rounds per banana.
Unless the elite and snazzy Iki special takes your fancy, extending your capacity to 40.
- We' ve got a Czechoslovakian...
- CZ 83, I' il take one.
Oh...
Well, that' s young Felix' s weapon of choice, isn' t it?
Now, there' s a trip down memory lane.
I' m partial to a bit of sentiment, me.
I' ve heard things, you know.
He misses you.
So, what are you going to take?
I' il take the Baretta, the CZ, an ankle holster, add the mini- 1 4 and I' m done.
- I want to get in and out fast.
- Don' t we all?
Does Durant still do his deals at the Port Hotel?
Silly lad.
It' il be his undoing, one of these days.
But what do you expect from a fella who gets his arse waxed every month?
I forgot what a circus this place is.
Funny, that.
I never did much like the circus.
All that poking your head in a lion' s mouth shite.
Bring on the horses!
Get 'em rogering the dancing girls!
That' s a circus.
These... and these are on the house.
Welcome home,... Dawn.
- There you go, mate.
- Thanks, mate.
Ta.
What the fuck did they do to this fish?
Batter it to death?
Fish and chips.
The national dish, mate.
More like a national disaster.
Keys.
Twat.
Come on.
So, er...
How much are they paying you to wear that skirt?
Fag?
No, motherfucker.
Ah, Mr. McElroy!
That' s daring, but very dashing attire.
Let' s stick to the business in hand.
Hey, come on!
Mr. McElroy' s a guest of ours.
OK boys Guns on the table please
Felix?
I' ve delivered him.
I' il have my tickets and be off.
Put your gun on the table.
- Fuck.
The game' s tomorrow.
- Put your fucking gun on the table, you gobshite!
What?
- So, who' s the chemist?
- This is Pudsey Smith.
A first- class man.
Qualified and everything.
He can' t talk.
He' s been shot.
Felix, have you shit your pants, or something?
Something doesn' t feel right, Mr. Durant.
You' re making me nervous, for fuck' s sake!
Sit on your hands, or something.
OK, Mr. McElroy, the ball' s in your court.
Opiates like heroin utilise dopamine
Sort of like the same sensation you get after sex.
Amphetamines increase adrenaline and cocaine gets those synapses in the brain firing really fast.
My product is 51 times stronger than cocaine.
51 times more hallucinogenic than acid and 51 times more explosive than ecstasy.
It' s like a personal visit..... from God.
It' s that good?
The dog' s bollocks.
Felix DeSouza.
- I count ten.
- That' s right.
That' s one million sterling, or 1... 1. 6 million dollars.
But that ain' t what we agreed on, is it?
You' re 1 8. 4 million dollars shy.
And I don' t care how you cut it, that' s a whole lot shy.
No...
Mr. McElroy, what we have there is a goodwill gesture.
A deposit.
A down payment.
One and a half million' s not a bad start, is it?
I need to do some research.
I need to feed a few thousand to the kids, get some feedback.
You don' t think I can allow you to walk out of here with $20 million for a formula that only exists in your head?
And all I get is what?
An ointment for toe jam.
Uh- huh?
- Market research.
Profile customers, send out questionnaires.
Get out the bloody way, Felix.
I can dig that.
But unless you' ve got what we agreed on, what the fuck am I doing here?
Give me a call when you' re ready to deal.
(Banging on door) - I fucking knew it.
(Quavery voice) Room service.
That old fuckin 'chestnut.
Aaargh!
Hey hold it fellas!
It' s my sausage and flamin 'mash!
- (Screams) - Ssh...
Sorry, love.
Sorry about that, pet.
It' s just that er... my dad ran off with a room service maid.
Things have never really been the same since.
Bollocks.
Now' s not a good time.
- Change of plan - What do you mean?
I want McElroy kept alive.
I don' t do alive, I do dead. it' s a matter of $20 million in cash being vaporised, and it' s a matter of a lot of anger being directed at The Lizard man.
You now do alive.
My future is inside McEroy' s skull
You waste anything and everybody that gets near him.
You waste them, not him.
His mind belongs to The Lizard
Shit.
Fucking hell!
Shit, shit, shit!
Arsehole.
Let go, you double- crosser.
They' re mine!
Oh!
Oh, shit.
Shit.
Ow!
Shit!
I told you to get out of the way, Felix.
- Fuck!
I' ve been shot.
- Where?
In the fucking arse!
Man, it' s just a flesh wound.
Come on.
Flesh wound?
Is that supposed to sound like a fuckin 'good thing?
Come on, dude.
Oi, sooty.
Sooty!
Here.
Take these.
- Aaargh!
- Oh, fuck!
Fuckin 'get him, boys.
Come on!
- Stay down, bitch.
You' re not driving my car!
Shit.
Give me the fuckin 'keys.
Get in the car.
Fuck!
Aaargh!
Fucking hell!
Get your fat arse out of the flamin 'car.
Check the hotel.
Put me in the picture.
What the fuck happened back there?
I just got shot in the fucking arse
- is what happened!
- This is not how we do fuckin 'business.
- Just get out of the fucking car!
- All right.
All right.
Oh, fuck!
What the fuck are you doing?
Woah...
Just take a fucking left!
- Get off the pavement!
Watch out!
Fuck!
- Which fucking way?
- Right.
- Come on!
- Aargh.
Christ!
Hey
- The traffic' s coming from the right.
Fuck!
Out of my fuckin 'way!
- Oh, bollocks.
- The dog' s bollocks?
Just plain fucking bollocks.
Watch out!
Watch out!
You' il kill the fucking car!
Fuck.
Fuck.
So, let me get this straight.
"Bollocks" is bad, whereas "the dog' s bollocks" is good, huh?
Yeah.
Oh, bollocks.
Gotcha.
Come on, then!
Come on!
Aaa- aargh!
- Stop.
- God.
Fucking Yanks.
Come on!
Shit.
Fucking hell.
Scraping my fucking paintwork!
Shit.
Shit.
Shit.
Shit.
- Fuck you, Kane, you shitebag.
- Fuck off!
Oh, you little fuck!
Chicken bollocks.
Shit!
Whoa- oa!
Fuck you, Kane, you fucking wanker!
Come here, you!
- Are you all right?
We' ve lost them.
Yeah, well, let' s not take any chances.
Oh...
Oh, shit!
Ugh...
Are you wanting to junk that, pal?
You what?
Dude, do you have a car that works?
I need transportation.
I' ve got a Cooper needing a lick of paint.
She goes.
Throw in the XJ6 and she' s yours for a 1 00 quid.
- Deal.
- What, a Cooper?
Piss off, Popeye.
And you.
I' il tell you what 70, quid and the Jag and I' m robbing myself.
Tha... that' s it.
That' s it.
I' ve had just about enough of this shite
I got you to that deal in one piece.
I got you out of that deal in one piece.
As far as I' m concerned, my job' s done.
It' s finished.
You can leave my motor alone, get your golf clubs, and fuck off back to Dixie.
Pay attention, Felix DeSouza.
I atomised a major drugs syndicate to be here this morning.
Now, I' m stuck in Liver- fucking- fool with you!
And if I need you to sell your car to help me, you will sell your goddamn car!
Do I look like the Salvation Army?
Have I got Jim' il Fix It written on my fucking hat?
I' m sorry, mate, but help' s not a word I' m too familiar with, you know.
Fuck off!
I don' t believe it.
So, who' s the girl?
It' s my ex- girlfriend.
Arthur.
I want you to describe the situation to me.
Seven shades of shit in a one- shit trumpet, sir.
It looks like some kind of a drugs buy.
None of your ordinary
Got some blue tabs.
They look like sweets.
How are you?
What do you mean, how am I?
Nearly cut my fucking ear off!
And I' ve hurt my knee.
Now, I want you to get the pills and take them straight down to the lab, double time.
You got that?
And then you call me.
Now, what else have you got?
Six dead bodies and one live one.
- (Groans) - Chief, it' s Leopold Durant.
Durant?
Right.
Now, concentrate, Arthur.
Get that fat fuck down here pronto.
But, sir, he' s dying.
Then you' d better be fucking quick about it, hadn' t you?
She dumped me.
Two years ago now.
Changed her name from Dawn to Dakota.
Fucked off for Las Vegas and a deck of cards.
So who hired her to take me out?
You' re asking the wrong question, mate.
She' s your guardian angel.
if she wanted you dead you' d be dead
She never misses.
I mean, fucking look at that.
If she really wanted to hit me... I' d be shiteing through a tube for the rest of my life.
Someone wants you kept alive.
Somebody' s trying to cut in on Durant' s deal.
They' re shitting again.
- Yeah, well, shit happens.
Shit don' t just happen, shit takes time.
Shit takes effort. $20 million- worth of effort.
I' ve got to get a new deal on, fast.
You know the town, you know the players.
Look..... all I want is a ticket for the game.
Do you think you can swing that? $20 million could swing anything.
You know what I' m selling.
Well, how much?
5% of whatever I get out of any deal you set up.
That' s a million dollars.
Hell, you could buy your own goddamn stadium with that.
- Game' s tomorrow.
- You' d better get started, then.
Oh, and Felix.
A word of advice.
You ever want to get the girl, you' ve got to broaden your horizons.
What the fuck is that?
What is it?
Scotch mist?
Now, now, now, now, now.
You are getting greedy, Leopold.
It' s a big deal going down, and you are trying to cut me out of the fucking loop.
- (Leopold screams in agony) - I told you.
This is going to cost you an additional 15%.
No?
All right, then.
As you' re being so difficult.
How about this?
Why settle for anything less, eh?
60- 40.
Leopold, I don' t know if you noticed, my son, but you' re in urgent need of a fucking doctor.
50- 50.
Good boy.
All right, then, Arthur.
Take him down.
Argh!
Fuck!
You really have excelled yourself this time, haven' t you, Arthur?
Fucking brilliant.
Omar, it' s my own interpretation, innit?
- You need to find your centre.
- Get off my leg!
- Find your centre.
- Stop messing...
Omar, you' re messing with my delicate energy field here, all right?
OK, OK.
- Cocksucker.
- Find your centre, Omar.
Hello?
You' ve got one chance, mate - yes or no - to be the number one shite in this particular cesspool.
Bugger me sideways.
Felix DeSouza, you misguided wanker.
I' m already number one.
Always was a bit of a pock - Leo Durarnt
- Now he' s a dead pock - Dead?
(Mobile rings) - Hang on, Felix.
It' s my other line.
Hello?
I need to find Felix.
Hello, Dawn.
Time to scratch that itch, is it?
Well, he' s gnawing my fucking wigwam.
- Where does he hang out these days?
- Hang on a minute, Dawn.
Felix...
Listen, me and er...
My associate and I have selected you to deal with.
Well, aren' t I just the luckiest bugger alive?
- Stay there.
- I don' t fucking believe it.
- Have you tried Re- Fresh, Pink Factor?
- Yeah, all of them.
Hang on a minute, tiger.
Just let me deal with this.
Let me talk to him.
The deal is $20 million
The deal is non- negotiable.
The deal expires at midnight.
Oh, Mr. McElroy, 20 million sounds fannytastic.
Negotiation' s for arsewipes.
If you' re not here by midnight, I' il shit myself with woe.
I want samples, Mr. McElroy.
Supersonic samples.
I want frost, I want 100, 000 miles an hour of intergalactic spaciness.
We in the house.
Iki:
Hya Daw Sorry to keep you
There might be one person who knows where he is.
Fuck.
What the fuck is that?
FELlX:
Congratulations pal That' s your new Cooper
Mini Cooper.
Have I got to sort out every fucking problem?
Or as you would say, a lab- oratree.
We need a lab, Felix.
I' m sure that' s dead easy where you come from.
Fucking lab on every corner, is it?
Piss off.
Well, shit in a bag and punch it.
She' s back.
I need to find Felix.
And what do you need from me?
A map and a fucking compass?
Shirley...
You broke his heart.
Did you even give a thought about that?
- This was a mistake.
- Most sensible thing you' ve said.
Are you still shooting people for a living?
What kind of fucking career is that, then, eh?
- Look, can I come in?
- And do what?
The dirty stop- out doesn' t come home till breakfast.
Really good to be home.
It' s great to see you again, love.
I wanted to see the world.
Liverpool isn' t the world.
I couldn' t take America.
It was like fucking Albania in neon.
And that stupid football shirt.
What kind of man jumps into bed shouting, "Come on, you Reds"?
She made me laugh.
Good shag, though.
I tell you, she' d kill anyone for me, I' il say that for her.
He' s got problems.
She' s got problems.
Shouldn' t have come back.
Better off.
I need everything on this list.
I' m dying for a smoke.
You haven' t any ciggies, have you?
I' m sorry.
Cigarettes are bad for your health.
So' s a fucking punch in the throat.
I need fucking nicotine now!
No need to shout at me.
I' m Pakistani, not deaf.
- Take a puff on this!
- Oh, fuck off.
You?
You!
Dress- wearing er... monkey- boy.
Monkey- boy!
You' re going to take them drugs of yours and make it work for us.
- And where would I do this?
- In my lab.
- You got a lab?
- Yeah, of course.
What do you take us for?
Rank fucking amateurs?
Come on!
Just say no.
How the fuck did we end up in here?
One little mistake... 30 years ago.
All of these items are over- the- counter.
Nothing illegal here.
You' re no fucking help, are you?
I beg to differ.
You see, it' s not the ingredients themselves which determine the effect but the manner in which they' re combined.
These kids are getting very smart.
He' s right.
The ravers are the key.
Aren' t you the clever little chunky monkey?
You keep banging on about my weight.
You' re crossing a line.
Arthur, it was a joke.
Smile.
Smile.
You fat cunt.
Yo, Blowjob.
P- O- S 51.
Comes in blue or race- car red.
Destination: stratosphere.
Only, this one gets you there in 60 seconds.
You try one first.
Thought you' d never ask.
P- O- S 51?
You can' t call it that.
Punters' il feel like right tits asking for tabs of 438 l- O- U, whatever the number is.
No- one' s going to know what they' re on about.
These scumbags spend their entire life smacked out of their heads.
Numbers - they couldn' t even tell you what fucking time it is.
All right, Mr. Smug, what have you done?
I think the shit' s about to hit the fan.
Arrrrrgh!
Phew.
Eurgh.
- (All groan and fart) - Curry was a bad idea, lads.
(Farting) - Oh yeah
Please.
BLOWFlSH:
Oh, thanks.
Iki:
Brothers gonna work it out.
Brothers gonna work t out
He' s a chemical brother!
Mr. McElroy... welcome.
- How you doing, man?
- Spectacular is what I' m doing.
Spectacular
Nice skirt.
Special occasion, is it?
- Are you going to be all right here on your own?
- Mm- hm.
- She' s here.
- Right.
- Everything all right, lads?
Problems?
Nothing we can' t handle.
Every chemical used in the production of this drug is 100% legal.
Not one ingredient is found on any known government' s banned substance watch list.
Hell, you can ship super tankers of this shit.
You can even lay a goddamn pipeline and no- one would bat an eye.
P- O- S 51.
It' s all that.
And it can be yours.
If the price... is right.
Chemistry... Mr. McElroy.
What is chemistry..... but the ability to attract adoration in others?
You see, you' re like me, Mr. McElroy.
You' re a sky- highatrist, I' m a sky- high artist.
See always knew 'd be a drug dealer even when was a kid saw my dad ht my mother my mother ht my brother my brother hit my sister, and my sister fuck my father.
So it' s inevitable, really.
You' d have to be on drugs just to live in that madhouse, wouldn' t you?
Drugs are good, Mr. McElroy.
Drugs are our mates.
Fuck.
I' m getting on my own nerves.
What I' m trying to say to you, Mr. McElroy, is..... I? m very much attracted to what you have to offer.
How are you doing, Felix?
Well, my boss is dead..... can' t get a ticket for tomorrow' s match, and, oh, yeah, I' ve got a fucking bullet hole in the arse.
Apart from that,
I' m tiptop.
So who' s the target?
You' ve got that look in your eye.
I' ve been looking for you
For old times' sake or for the company I keep?
Little bit of both.
So, you have got me on your list, then?
You' ve always been on my list.
- (Whooping and cheering) - 40 years ago a rock- and- roll revolution was launched in this town.
Tonight, we' re going to launch a new revolution.
One that will rock and roll your senses.
And you... are my test pilots.
You' re going to kiss the sun and taste the motherfuckin 'rainbow.
- (Cheering)
- (Cheering)
Then let' s get ready to party- y- y- y.
Have you any idea how much I missed you?
Why didn' t you stay with me, then?
What, me? in America?
Don' t be soft!
Besides, I don' t know who you are any more, girl.
It' s been nearly two years.
I haven' t heard a word.
Still...
I always hoped...
.. you might... change your mind..... and come home.
We could have a fresh start.
Aren' t you going to say anything?
This, Mr. McElroy, is a fucking miracle.
Drug use will reach epidemic proportions, revolutions will break out, governments will fall!
20 million, and not a penny less!
- Where do I sign?
Sign?!
This ain' t some written contract.
The kind of agreement I could take you to court and sue your ass over.
You fuck me on this deal,
I gotta take out a contract just to get even on the goddamn contract!
We think we have an agreement, we think we see things the same way.
Either we do, or we don' t.
You' re either in, or you' re out.
You give me the money, I give you the formula.
Are we clear?
Crystal, Mr. McElroy.
Crystal.
I' m not Leo Durant.
I' m a man of my word.
Get in my way, and I' m gonna have to shoot you.
Get in my way, and I' m gonna have to shoot you again.
I' ve got to work, babe.
Fucking cow!
Oh, fuck!
Can' t a brother just deal some goddamn drugs?
Time to go, Elmo.
Mr. Kane.
Is it that time of the month already?
I thought you weren' t due till next week, you eager beaver.
Now, ain' t that always the way?
Elevator music, a nigger in a kilt, and a chick with a nickel- plated nine.
And now a word from our sponsor.
That ain' t no Liverpool accent.
- Say hello, Elmo.
- Hello, Elmo.
Absence makes the heart grow fonder Elmo
And The Lizard s so fu of motherfucking fonderence for you that he got on this plane just to come see you.
I' m touched.
- You w be.
- You got my cash?
You' re flush, sweetcakes.
You are flush.
He' s looking forward to seeing you.
So, what' s the price tag on my ass?
It' s enough.
Move.
Last stop.
There' s nowhere from here but down.
Reel me in!
Why would I do a stupid thing like that?
- Pull me up, will you?
- Fold or call?
- What?
Fold or call?
- (Whimpers) - I' m your last chance, girl.
I' m that out you' ve been looking for.
I' m only gonna make this offer once.
You either take it and get out from under The Lizard or you stay a slave and wonder where your life went.
You think you can save me, do you?
Look where you are!
- Get real!
- A million in bonds, untraceable.
That' s a fresh start.
Try quitting while you' re ahead for a change... Dawn.
- No.
- No?!
I want 10% of your deal with Iki.
You' re negotiating with me?!
Look at your options.
10%.
Have a look at yours.
All right.
Now that is a lovely dress.
Need the extra room, do you?
I' m intrigued.
Is it true that you fellas are equipped with incredibly..... large...
Fuck!
Thanks.
My pleasure.
You can move your arm now.
KANE:
Right, then you Scouse git n the last 12 hours this city has gone from a peaceful fun- loving Utopia to an all- out fucking war zone.
And I, Virgil Kane...
Well, I want to know why.
Nobody cuts me out of anything in this parochial pisshole.
You smell that, Felix.
- (Sniffs)
That is essence of Durant.
And Durant got what he deserved.
So, when a deal goes down, you, my old sausage, will fix it.
And then you will call me.
Otherwise...
Accessory to murder.
Possession of a firearm.
You fuck me,
I' il have you on your hands and your knees, with your arse in the air, exposing your rusty sheriff' s badge for the next 20 years.
So ask yourself, are you going to help restore some national pride, and stick one on the Yanks?
Or, like the rest of your life, are you going to piss it all away?
Are you going to help me to help you?
Eight hours till kickoff.
It' s a big game.
Let' s just see if you come good.
Mr. Kane.
(Chuckles)
- (Laughs)
Help me to help you?
Cunt!
How do you think that motherfucker would do against people who diss
like Soso McGure Grffy?
They' d be knocking this shit out the park
He can' t throw that kinda heat!
Kevin? s got what' s goin 'on here!
- You don' t know what you? re taking about DAWN:
Kevin Brown couldn' t carry Sandy Koufax' s jockstrap.
You' ve been listening to too much Vince Scully.
You need to get your ear out of the radio, and carry your ass out to the ball game.
Sorry, but er..... have I missed something?
What the fuck is that?
- Black pudding.
Fried pig' s blood.
- Oh!
Are you two planning on filling me in, or what?
Elmo' s propositioned her.
Nice one, Shirley.
I' m listening.
Lizard offered Dakota 250K to deliver my live ass to him.
I' ve made her a significantly better offer.
And I' m thinking... she might entertain..... certain sentimental reasons for not doing her job.
The question s whether it' s going to pay me... to be sentimental.
Look, we have a choice.
We can use our "Get out of jail free" cards, or we can choose "Stop, do not pass Go".
Do not collect 20 million dollars.
Do we have a deal?
Do that again, I will definitely fucking shoot you.
Shut your gob!
Go and get yourself cleaned up!
- And no shagging up there!
No shagging up there.
We do this job and we get out.
It' s what we all want, isn' t it?
Just to get out.
So, what' s the plan?
You tell me.
What' s the plan?
You tell me.
Listen!
It' s got to come from your belly.
Right deep down!
It' s your birth trauma.
Now cleanse your charkas and let it all out.
- Let it go!
- I' m trying, you fucking fairy!
A- a- a- a- ah!
All right?
A- a- a- ah!
A- a- a- a- a- ah!
- All- righty.
- All right, let' s finish this deal.
My sentiments exactly.
- Any particular venue?
- No airports no hotel rooms no dockyards, no barges, no pharmacies,
- no animal- testing labs.
- No rooftops.
- Riddles!
Riddles!
I love riddles.
No abandoned warehouses or rave clubs.
I want total privacy in a very public place.
And security.
Cops.
Lots of them.
And witnesses.
Thousands of witnesses.
- You getting my drift?
- We er 've got a certain er business indulgence, shall we say, that I could er... utilise.
- So, what time' s kickoff?
- Three o? clock sharp
I' il be there.
Football and drugs.
A perfect Saturday afternoon.
Liverpool!
Liverpool!
Come on!
Charkas!
No, no, no, no, no, chubster.
- You stay here.
- What for?
I don' t know.
Keep your eyes peeled on the exit.
And try for fuck' s sake to blend in, cunt!
This clown better deliver.
Don' t worry.
Iki put something like this together a couple of years ago now.
What happened?
They all died.
We get in, we get out.
What about the game?
- We' re staying to watch the game, right?
- Dude, I' m in, then I' m out.
Virgin Atlantic announce the arrival of Flight ES12 from Los Angeles

Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Welcome to Anfield, the home of football.
- Too right, pal.
- McElroy, DeSouza.
Yes, sir.
It' s the first door on your right, sir.
Thank you.
- Sir?
- Don' t you want to search me?
Guests for the executive suites are never searched, sir.
Right.
I knew that.
Welcome!
Come in, come in.
Excellent.
I' m nothing if not hospitable, Felix.
Make yourself at home.
I' m so excited I could shit!
- Huh?
- Right, Mr. McElroy, a drink while tell you about my plans
Oh I' ve got plans Mr. McEroy
- Big fucking plans.
- Hey hey hey!
No talk.
You want a beverage?
I' il fix your beverage while you get the 20 mill.
I give you the formula, you smile, we toast, we pretend we' re friends, - and we go our separate ways.
- It' s the only way to a good relationship.
Iki, my love, we' re way past holding hands.
20 million in bonds.
Untraceable.
What?!
Is that supposed to be 20 mill?
It' s not fucking Goldfinger, is it?
Ah- ah- ah- ah!
Easy, flower.
Where' s my formula?
Wish you were here?
I' m fucking there, Mr. McElroy.
I' m fucking there.
An inspired choice, I must say, my er... chemical brother.
Cheers.
Ah- ah- ah- ah!
I never was one to be too sentimental.
Elmo!
t ain' t often that a blowed- up motherfucker gets to chat to the motherfucker that blowed him up.
You got that right.
Usually, the blowed- up motherfucker has the courtesy to stay blowed up.
I' il try to be more accommodating next time, Elmo.
Ooh, cocktails!
What are we celebrating?
Oh, er... we' re toasting..... our deal, Mr. Lizard.
- Our deal?
- Not your deal.
Hands across the ocean you might say
Fucking twat.
Elmo Mix- Master.
Cheers.
- I love your touches.
- To a global partnership.
To a global partnership!
Ow.
Fucking limey bastard.
Global partnership, my ass!
My money is on good old- fashioned American monopoly, you son of a bitch!
Besides,
England ain' t nothin '... nothing' but the 51 st. state!
Don' t you just fucking hate it when a motherfucker stabs you in the back?
The Lizard travelled 1 2, 000 miles to settle accounts with you!
What?
You gonna tell me how much you missed me, or are you gonna shoot me?
I' m sick and tired of fucking chasing your ass!
Now, you give me my fucking goods, and you give 'em to me fucking now!
You better chill with that shit, motherfucker. - own you!
- You own me?
- I fucking own you!
- You own shit!
Go ahead, kill me.
Put me out of my misery for the first time in 30 years.
But you will no longer take what is mine.
Fucking right.
10% is mine.
- Five!
- Five fucking per cent of that' s mine.
Shut the fuck up!
I don' t even know who the fuck you are!
Oh, you' ve got some big fucking onions, Elmo.
This... is the most expensive candy on the market.
The drug' s a fake, you know.
It' s bogus.
It' s what we chemists call a placebo.
It' s whatever you want it to be.
You can run all the tests you want, and it' il look like the best shit in the universe, but the ingredients... they cancel each other out.
Fucking confusing The Lizard ain' t gonna fucking help your cause, Elmo.
You' ve gotta give big ups to marketing.
The ability to make people believe.
The power of suggestion.
P- O- S 51.
I don' t give a shit!
Is this fucking science lecture over?
It will be in... 23 seconds.

1 2 seconds?
What the fuck are you talking about?
And what is the big fucking umbrella?
Freeze!
- Oh!
- You lumpy in the kaftan, drop the gun.
How' s my timing, Felix?
It' s fucking perfect.
Ow!
Argh!
Aaaargh!
Aargh!
That cleared my sinuses.
Drugs... always kill you in the end.
Whoa!
Whoa, shit!
All right, lads.
Get the cuffs on this cockney twat!
As agreed.
What about the drug?
You conned us.
I conned them
We got paid.
Is this, or is this not, worth 20 million dollars?
This castle' s worth,
I' d say, more like... seven, seven and a half.
Do you want to see the game?
Watch the world flow
Mr. McElroy, you are a genuine McElroy like myself, you say.
This is the tartan of my slave master.
I now claim his castle and his lands for my own.
I see.
- But will you not now be making your putt?
Congratulations, Mr. McElroy.
An outstanding round of golf.
You ain' t seen nothing yet.
Well!

He' s writing a book aboutthe agency' s history in Africa. He' s going to name names.
It' s basically a shakedown. He' s demanding the agency' s help.
He wants us to put him backin power in six months or else.
This interview, and I' ilmake the tape availableto anyone who wants it... he goes on to claimthat he' s just survivedan assassination attempt.
He says it' s us. He says he' s got proof.
The director wants to knowif there' s any possible shred of truthin this accusation.

Well, you got to clean that up. No, I can' t clean it up.
There' s a bodyin the streets. So?
There' s police. This is Paris.
Put up the scanners. Get as much radioinformation as you can.
I' il gofind a place for this money. I' il be back in ten minutes.
I told youto stay in the car.
Jesus Christ. I told you to stay in the car.
I needed a drink. I didn' t think you wouldcome back anyway.
You got to go to the cops. Right now.
You got to go beforethis gets any worse. By myself?
It' s gonna be okay. Take my passport, okay? You show this to them.
You tell them everythingthat happened.
Everything. They' re gonna believe you.
They have to believe you. a
Marie, you can' t just sit here. It' s not safe here.
This is frominside the embassy.
Who can do this? This is from yesterday. I- I don' t know.
How can they even knowthat we' re together?
Just --
Try -- How are you gonnamake this right... by sending me there alone? Do you think I want youto go to the cops?
You think that' sgood for me? You want to go, fine.
You go to the cops, I gotta run. You tell them what happened.
I don' t know what happened! I don' t know who this guy was!
I don' t know about that picture! I don' t know who I am!
Look, I' m -- You' re acting likel' m trying to burn you here.
- I' m just tryingto do the right thing. - Nobody does the right thing.
I can' t --
We run -- I gotta livelike this.
I don' t even knowwho I' m hiding from.
These people know who I am. Now I gotta --
I gotta stay here. I gotta figure this out. g
So figure it out. s
You take careof this car?
What do you mean? Tires felt a little splashyon the way over here.
It pulls a little to the right. i
Last chance, Marie.
So... What? r uh, we got a bumpcoming up.
Turn your head away. Turn your head away.
You can nevercome back to this car.
You understand? Mm- hmm.
We' re gonna clean it outand I' il wipe it downand we walk away. P
That' s it.
Okay. Okay.
And I' il find a placefor us to rest, and I gotta think.
Do you have a hator a scarf or something? For my hair?
Yeah. Just untilwe can change it.
Sure.
Okay. Okay.
Speaking French
It' s not him. h
Ringing Man What do you have?
Woman Wombosi went to the morgue.
He saw the body. He didn' t buy it.
Where is he now? t
Woman I told you I' m not staffed for this.
Man Where is he now? Right now, where' s Wombosi?
They were leaving the morgue. Theyjust left.
Sir, what do youwant to do?
I need to get that pile.
I have visual confirmation on Hodaddy.
Repeat.
Still negative on the pickup.
All right, where are you, Percy?
Come on.
Come on.
Wait a second.
There' s our turncoat.
For crying out loud.
Special Agent Scott.
Mac here.
Tell me you found that pilot.
He' s right here.
- Is he alive?
Yeah, he' s okay.
Don' t screw this up, Alex.
I want him in one piece.
Consider it done.
- You okay?
- No, my leg' s broken!
That should help.
Let' s go before the Russians get here.
Hey, let me ask you something.
What' d you do with that plane that you stole?
Here they come.
I' m not talking until you get me out.
- Yeah.
All right, let' s go.
Gundars!
I sold the plane to Arnold Gundars.
Now get me out of here!
The American pilot has escaped!
Search the woods!
He must be in the woods!
What is this?
He tricked us!
- They' re coming!
- I got it.
No, I don' t.
Fire!
You okay?
Ladies and gentlemen, now making his way to the ring...... really needing no introduction the world over, he is undefeated...... with 56 wins, no losses...... here is the one and only...... Kelly "K. O." Robinson!
When I say break, break clean.
Keep those punches up high.
I' m fair, but I' m firm.
You' il have your first "Sports illustrated" cover.
Even though you' il be on it like this:
Yeah, shit.
He' s scary as hell, ain' t he?
Kelly Robinson has come up with an exotic new challenge for himself.
If he defends his title tonight...... he' il do it again Thursday in Budapest, Hungary.
I know what this mean when you do that.
And Lirette is on queer street.
What you doing?
Kelly' s getting frustrated because Lirette won' t fight.
I won' t chase you around the ring.
Take a shot at this here.
How about that?
Five!
Warm up the goulash in Budapest.
Hold on.
Come on, get this shot for "Sports illustrated".
Cheese.
Gonna be 58 and 0 in couple of days.
I know what you saying.
You better retire.
You gonna run out of space on that arm.
You been my boy for 10 years.
Get your head out my ass.
That' s pathetic.
You' ve only worked three years.
- Now, about the drawers.
- Yeah.
Yes, right.
Kelly.
- Kelly!
What' s going on?
It' s the president.
Really?
President of the United States.
The president want to talk to Kelly Robinson.
- What' s up, homey?
- What' s up?
- What' s up, dog?
- It' s all good.
- Kicking with Putin.
G. W. B., you should' ve called when the cameras was on.
- My bad.
- All right.
Hear you' re going to Budapest.
We got us a muy secret- o situation.
- Really?
- America needs your help.
- No problem.
- You got it, baby.
- Owe you one.
- All right, I' il talk to you real soon.
- I will not forget --
President want me to do him a favor.
He said something about America needs me.
- What kind of favor?
- Some kind of top- secret mission.
Oh, you mean like 007?
Yeah, except only I' m gonna be 009 and a half.
Know what I' m saying?
- It' s an innuendo.
- Yes, I am.
Kind of exciting.
- I' m a little nervous.
- I' m sure you' il do fine.
No, I know I will.
Rachel.
You' re still hung up on her?
Edna, I' m not hung up on her.
I find her interesting, and I admire her work.
You know, a blind man could see that.
I will tell her.
It' s just, I get nervous, and I end up sounding like an idiot --
- Yeah.
- Talk to Carlos.
What does that mean?
They had a thing?
She could barely walk.
Rachel and Carlos?
You are a vision, as always.
Hello, Alex.
Hello, Carlos.
How was Cuba?
Adequate.
Oh, adequate, my eye.
He single- handedly averted another Bay of Pigs.
- No, I didn' t -- - Yes.
- You exaggerate.
- Oh, well, I....
- You do exaggerate sometimes.
- Okay, at times, yeah.
And you, Alex?
How did you fare in the tundra?
You know, I did pretty good.
I got selected for a new mission, so obviously everybody was satisfied.
And the pilot?
The pilot....
Was able to talk to him, get some valuable information from him.
Successful mission.
No, no, no.
I mean....
I mean -- Yeah, he' s dead.
He' s dead.
What are you gonna do?
- Yeah.
You' re an excellent agent.
Don' t let results like this fool you.
All right?
Be back for my things later.
See you, Carlos.
La vida loca!
What a phony.
I' d give anything to go on a two- week stakeout with that man.
- I didn' t hear anything.
- It' s not what I heard, it' s what I saw.
I saw the look on her face.
Every woman recognizes that look.
- What' s that look?
- Look of total satisfaction.
Guy gets a couple missions in Latin America, and he' s a Julio lglesias.
You know, he' s from lowa, by the way.
- Is this my stuff?
- Oh, easy.
This is Carlos' stuff.
This is yours.
Where' s my monofilament phone descender?
I don' t see one of those.
You got the micro GPS.
Micro?
This is your spy- cam.
This is Carlos' spy- cam, and this is my spy- cam?
Look at the size of this thing!
Size matters.
But in the spy world, it' s reversed.
You want people to say, "Look how small and sexy and sleek this is."
Not, "How huge this is!
Look what he pulled out of his pants.
It' s huge! "
People will laugh at me if I pull this out.
Yes, it is.
I know, everybody wants to be like Carlos.
I don' t want to be like Carlos, but I notice...... my stuff looks like you can get it from RadioShack in 1972.
Yes, it is.
Right away.
It' s a good start, though.
Kelly Robinson, seen here making his typical flamboyant entrance --
Shouldn' t this be on the Weather Channel or something? -- with a first- round knockout of Blake "The Blade" Lirette.
That guy is so annoying.
Everybody "Hungary" for his showdown...... with the European heavyweight king, Cedric Mills.
You don' t understand how important it is...... that I be 58 and 0.
I' m 57 and 0 right now.
This man gonna be 58!
- Cheese.
Cheese.
Cheese.
Get my right side.
Cheese.
Alex!
Gen. Tucker, this is Special Agent Alex Scott.
- General.
- Special agent.
I love hearing that.
Special.
We were going over the op.
We call it the "Switchblade."
It was the first electrochromatic invisible stealth aircraft.
But in the hands of the evildoers...... it' s an untraceable delivery system for weapons of mass destruction.
Arnold Gundars.
The boys over at ClA have access to his overseas accounts.
The past five days, there' s been a depletion of funds...... without reimbursements.
He just hasn' t sold it yet.
I' il get it back, general.
Give me a minute.
Hot.
Are you sure we can' t use Carlos?
No, they all know him.
Without plastic surgery, he wouldn' t last five minutes on this case.
That' s a shame.
That Carlos is amazing.
This guy....
You sure about this, Mac?
He' il get the job done.
Shouldn' t Rachel be here?
She' s already in Budapest setting up.
You' ve worked with her before, right?
I have but not in a stakeout situation.
This mission doesn' t call for a stakeout.
It wouldn' t hurt to keep our options open.
The European middleweight championship...... is being held in Budapest in two days.
Gundars is a boxing fanatic.
Okay.
Classic stakeout scenario, right?
No stakeout.
This is more about hacking and tracking.
Now, take a look at this guest list.
You got to be kidding.
This is like a who' s who of international bad guys.
Obviously, Gundars is using this party as cover to auction the plane.
Your mission is to get into his palace...... find out where the plane is and stop him from selling it.
With these heavy hitters in one place, security' s gonna be insane.
Exactly.
The way we see it, there' s only one shot to get you in there.
Stakeout?
No.
We' ve arranged cover.
You' il be working with a civilian to secure entry.
A civilian?
57 and 0.
You know how Kelly Robinson do.
We don' t need to do it this way.
I think if --
I kicked ass all around the world.
Can we turn this off or change the channel?
He gives me a headache --
Watch what come out of your mouth, blond surfer boy.
He' s lighting into some reporter.
No, I' m talking to you.
Watch what come out of your mouth.
You' il get your ass whipped.
Video conference.
Alex Scott, meet Kelly Robinson.
That' s gotta be him.
Come on out here and give me some sugar, girl.
I had too much fun last night.
I got y' all' s numbers.
I' il talk to you all soon.
No Kelly, no stretchie.
Back of the bus.
Move the camouflage booty to the back of the bus.
Come on.
Hey, I' m Alex Scott.
We met yesterday, sort of.
Yeah, I remember.
The pleasure' s all mine.
Is that your plane?
No autographs!
He' s my new assistant.
Kelly, I thought I was your assistant.
T. J., what' d I tell you?
The secret mission?
Secret mission.
- Yeah, yeah, the Mission Man.
Right.
It' s not a good idea to tell them who I am.
We should keep that down.
I ain' t no fool.
I ain' t tell them who you was.
- What?
- Yeah, they think you' re a retard.
All you do is get some drool, a helmet and zip your jacket up.
Hold on just a second.
That' s good.
- Can I talk to you for a second?
Uncomfortable.
Too many brothers standing around.
We' re getting off on the wrong foot.
You think you' re the Harlem Globetrotters...... and I' m the team that looks like an idiot.
- Yeah, that' s it.
- But that' s not how it' s gonna work.
We' re on the same team.
I' m Meadowlark Lemon.
You' re Curly Neal.
You feed me the ball.
He do the dribbling.
You Meadowlark?
I' m pulling down the ref' s shorts, throwing pie in the face.
- And the rubber band on the ball.
- Right, doing the --
Meadowlark, you get me some of this chicken...... some sodas, jelly beans and get these bags and get on the plane.
- I' m not Kelly Robinson.
- He don' t make his own phone calls.
Come on.
I' m just trying to confirm the man' s reservation.
- All we need is a room.
- That' s all.
- Don' t make me get on that phone.
- What the hell is:
It means, "I speak English, just not to you, sucker."
Need some help?
- Yeah, knock yourself out.
The brother gonna speak Hungarian now.
You guys want the junior suite or the high- roller suite?
We go with the high- roller.
The cheapest room you' ve got.
In the basement.
- It' s all taken care of.
- Did you get an extra kusenum?
I' m gonna get these bags onboard.
- Yeah, yeah.
You better watch your job.
Rain Man got skills.
Kelly just took the stick.
- I thought he was doing an interview.
He was napping.
Now he' s flying the plane?
Come on, Kelly!
There' s a lot of stuff for us to go over --
Did you see me turn on the seat- belt light?
No, I didn' t see that.
When you get up, sit down.
Funny.
He' s a funny guy.
I gotta remember that one.
That' s a good trick.
I' m glad you got that out of your system.
I' m gonna need you at the party at 8.
Know something?
We got to change the schedule.
I ain' t about to start.
Are you gonna refer to yourself in the third person?
That can get irritating.
It won' t get irritating until 11: 00...... because that' s when I' m showing up for your little party.
Okay.
Excuse me, gents.
I can' t risk that.
The party could clear out by 11: 00.
Ain' t no party that Kelly Robinson at gonna end at 11: 00.
- That attitude can destroy a mission.
- Know what destroys a mission?
A lame- ass party that end at 11: 00.
Let that shit go, man.
- Drop the shit.
- I' il get T. J. or Jerry to get me in.
- Yeah, go get T. J. He' il help you.
I just hope that the optical diaphanous polyalloy transducers...... can fit on one of their retinas.
What you say?
What you got over there?
It' s one of the things we' ve got for the mission.
It' s cool.
It opens up.
Wait.
I don' t want T. J. 's eye juices on something that goes in my eye.
Maybe I should try it.
What you call it?
- Polyalloy transducers.
- The polyalloy should be for me.
Let me put it in my eye, then.
- I put this in my eye?
- Put it in your eye.
- Yeah.
Okay, I' il put this in.
And I got the camera in my eye.
What' s gonna happen now?
Can you see anything?
What about now?
- Hey, I see me!
- Look, watch this.
Shit, now I see the TV.
I' m seeing what you seeing.
- Exactly.
- I see me looking at you looking at me!
Hey, Kelly Robinson.
Look at this.
Put this behind your ear.
It' s a listening device.
- Just stick it back here?
- Can you hear me?
Yeah, it sound like you in my head.
Shit, I like this!
We' il do that on the mission.
- At 11: 00, though.
- No, not 11: 00.
I already spoke.
Kelly Robinson has spoke.
I said 11, it' s 11.
It' s a dead issue.
Let it go.
I said 11, goddamn it!
Get out my face!
- That shit is bad.
- Then give them back.
I ain' t giving back shit.
Take them.
That look like I' m yelling at me.
Take them!
I' m Kelly Robinson, baby, 57 and 0!
I' il kick your ass!
This is what it look like when I' m whupping somebody' s ass.
Kelly.
Look at that move.
Why you staring at me?
Do something.
- Okay, Kelly.
- I heard that in my head.
You looking in the cockpit right now.
That' s a trip.
- What' s our altitude?
- About 3 7, 000 feet.
- Is that a Cessna on the horizon?
Surfer boy!
- You seeing this?
- What are you doing?
- Come fly the plane.
- Wake him back up!
- He fell asleep.
- You put that dart in his back!
- I thought you knew how to fly it.
- Wake him up.
He put it on automatic for me!
The deal is, we go at 8, and I wake the pilot up.
Okay, then let the plane crash.
Let it crash.
You know that ride I just took?
I' m ready to die, baby.
I' m Kelly Robinson.
Death?
Crash it.
This is getting crazy.
Wake the man up.
Just wake the man up!
He ain' t woke.
He' il be fine.
- So you a pilot this whole time?
- I can fly a little.
Okay, I see how this is gonna work.
I ain' t coming to no party at 8: 00.
I told you 11: 00.
Here' s your eye.
- Hey, be careful with that.
If you broke something in my plane, if something in my plane is broke....
You in trouble, T. J.
Oh, God.
It wasn' t my fault, man.
I' m going downstairs!
You got five minutes to get me the most expensive suite...
-... or else, T. J.!
- Or else what?
I don' t know what else, because I don' t think good underground.
But whatever it is, it' s gonna be bad!
Let me tell you something.
You falling off.
You' re gonna be back in St. Louis, frying fish.
Now, you mess up one more time again.
Please do it one more.
How' s the room?
My room is fine.
Oh, did I say 11?
Maybe.
- What' s with the attitude?
- Kelly Robinson?
The famous boxer?
- Yeah, one and the same, baby.
- It' s a big thrill for you, huh?
You don' t know.
I know you from the advertisement for your perfume.
- TKO.
It' s not perfume.
It' s cologne.
Perfume is for ladies and sissies.
I so stupid.
So, Kelly, tell me...... do you really wear it?
Well, you tell me.
I' d love to go to your room and get your autograph.
Is that right?
I' d really love to, but unfortunately, my room ain' t ready.
Let' s go to mine.
-... very close.
Wrong.
Excuse me.
Come here for a second.
- Excuse me.
- What' s wrong with you?
- What are you doing?
But if you let go of my arm...... I' m gonna go across and wax that ass.
You are a spy right now.
I can' t have you running off...... with a strange Hungarian woman.
Going off with a strange woman is what I do.
Mind your own business.
Have a good evening, all right?
- I' m just jealous.
- I know, but she chose Kelly.
I' il hit it once for you, all right?
- See if she' s got a sister.
- If so, it' il be the three of us.
What you say your name was?
- Are you going to scream it?
I had a couple of interesting situations where....
Hey, slow it down!
I got a lady over here.
How long have you been working for the U. S. government?
- I work for Kelly Robinson.
- There was BNS agent on your jet.
- I don' t know.
- You' ve been reading spy novels.
- Maybe we should cut off his penis.
Cut off my penis?
What happened to "rough the man up"?
- Cut it off!
- Wait a second!
You ain' t cutting off nobody' s penis!
I' il answer all your questions, but --
- Who' s the agent?
- I' m not sure if he' s an agent.
- Who' s the agent?
- I don' t know if he' s an agent or not!
- He' s 5 foot 9.
Blond hair -- - His name?
I' m not sure, but he' s very annoying.
He' s definitely a BNS agent.
He got one of them white names.
Alan or....
- Take off his pants.
- Why you gonna take my pants off?
Please don' t cut off Kelly Robinson' s penis.
Kelly!
Kelly, shoot her!
Shoot her!
Did I kill her?
Not yet.
- Stop shooting that.
- What the hell' s going --?
I' m sorry, I' m being rude.
Special Agent Rachel Wright.
- Nice to officially meet you.
- You' re a spy!
Don' t tell anyone.
- You' re all BNS?
- It' s all BNS.
- Big fan, Mr. Robinson!
- Crazy way of showing it.
- God, Alex, you been working out?
Why?
- You just got buff.
Alex wanted to test you before we put you in the game.
- So this whole thing was a big test?
- Unbelievable.
That was great.
- Really?
- Really.
Oh, cool.
- Guys, excuse us for a second.
- Yeah.
- Hey, good job.
Good.
I have seen hundreds of agents...... put through that exercise, and I' ve never seen it handled so well.
- Never.
- Never.
Well, Kelly Robinson.
It was like your instincts were perfect.
Give them unimportant information.
Like he' s blond, 5' 9 ".
How many guys fit that description?
That doesn' t mean anything.
You' d never name names.
You know what you are?
You' re a "why not" guy, not a "why" guy.
- What' s the difference?
- A "why" guy' s like:
"Why are we gonna do this?"
They' re afraid to make a decision.
Afraid they might get in trouble.
- He' s like, "Roll the dice."
Kelly Robinson.
The "why not" guys are like eagles.
They don' t flock.
The few, the proud, the "why not."
The president wouldn' t have called me if I wasn' t a "why not" guy.
Let me see everything.
Now, Kelly, we gotta get you up to speed.
You' re about to hear a national secret.
This is Arnold Gundars, premier arms dealer.
He has this plane...... the Switchblade.
It' s a sophisticated prototype stolen from the U. S. government.
This is the next generation of stealth technology.
Undetectable to radar, infrared, even the human eye.
- Our mission is to get it back.
- To make a long story short...... we can' t find it, because we can' t see it.
Here it is with the electrochromatic cloaking device engaged.
Like one of those bugs that look like a leaf.
- One of the who?
But it' s not really a leaf.
It can make itself look like one.
A leafy bug.
It' s a good name for it.
You should call that the "Leafy Bug".
- That' s a good idea.
- I' il pass that on.
The Leafy Bug.
We gotta go.
We' il be late for the mission.
Yamaguchi.
- Tuxedo.
- I' m gonna set that all up.
Hey, Alex, I' m sorry I kneed you and roughed you up in there.
You okay?
My gosh, don' t be ridiculous.
I thought that was great.
When you kneed me, I loved that.
- I just felt it helped sell it.
Wait to turn this on.
The satellite' s only good for the next 72 hours.
Let' s hope that' s more than we need.
All right, set us up.
- Hey, what' s in that bag?
- Spy stuff.
Always have a sure way out.
- Hey, Rachel.
- What' s up?
It feels like a stakeout, doesn' t it?
No.
And we are live.
Hey, what' s that for?
This is how I' m gonna break this case wide open with your help.
It' s a replica of the pen Gundars carries.
There' s an IHB tracking device built in.
Technology.
If Alex can plant it on him, we can follow his movements.
Let' s do this, then.
Nice shifting, Rachel.
You make it look easy.
Thank you.
Please tell me you didn' t say, "nice shifting."
- Don' t worry about it.
- You really like that girl, huh?
- Rachel?
No.
- Mr. Robinson!
- I am very big fan.
- How you doing?
You a fan too?
How you doing?
Kelly Robinson, 57 and 0.
- You got that?
Kelly!
Tell these guys I' m with you.
I' m with the boxer.
I' ve never seen that man before.
Shoot him in his ass.
- Hey, no, he' s -- - I' m just playing.
Don' t shoot the guy.
He' s with me.
Sorry about that, guys.
That' s a bad start.
That' s revenge for the hotel.
Now let me do mine.
Yeah.
Kelly Robinson, y' all, in the flesh.
Y' all looking at the fastest man in the world!
Y' all ready for the Slugfest in Budapest?
Yeah!
This is great honor to meet you.
Hey, look, it' s an honor for me to let you meet me.
How about that, huh?
All right, good meeting you.
Take it easy.
I like him.
I like the way he talks.
- You just met Marwan Motaheeshi.
- Who' s that?
He controls death squads.
They kill thousands of people every year.
- All right, here he comes.
- Okay, that' s Gundars?
- That' s a bad- ass jacket he got on.
- Turn around.
- Yeah, okay.
Get away.
- I won' t disappear.
- Give me the pen.
Give --
- Back up before -- - Mr. Robinson.
Good to meet you.
Mr. Gundars, the pleasure' s mine.
Thank you.
Your fight here promises to be the most exciting event...... that Budapest has seen in some time.
Since you such a nice guy...... I ain' t gonna break your boy up too bad.
- Thank you - Yeah.
- Mr. Robinson, your champagne.
- Thank you.
One of the ladies wants an autograph.
No problem at all, but you have a pen I could use?
I don' t.
Didn' t I tell you at all times to keep a pen?
- My assistant' s penless.
- It won' t happen again.
- I said to have a pen....
Mr. Gundars is always prepared.
Thank you.
You have to be prepared.
I' m disappointed, I want you to know.
Take that.
Here you go.
Clown ass.
It' s hard to get somebody that' il do their job the right way.
I' m sorry about that.
Here' s your pen, Mr. Gundars.
- Well, enjoy the party.
Nice to see you.
I have some business.
Take care of your business.
Take care of your business.
Hey, you a real player.
I had it under control until you showed up.
I know you did.
Okay, he' s taking off.
I need you to create a distraction.
Create a distraction?
What do you mean?
Do what?
Make a scene or do something.
That should come easy for you.
Make a scene?
Baddest man on the planet!
Come on, everybody.
Let' s get a show going here.
Where' s Cedric Mills?
Hey, come on.
Break that up.
Come on, y' all look great, but get out the ring.
It' s about me and Cedric.
Cedric Mills, where you at?
Hey, Cedric!
You in the house?
I know I seen you!
There you go, Cedric.
What you doing down there?
Having a steroid cocktail?
I do not take the steroids.
You need something if you get in the ring with me.
Let' s give the people a preview.
Don' t be scared.
I ain' t gonna hurt you.
Cedric Mills, everybody! ln the flesh!
That' s a brave man there.
That' s like swimming with Jaws.
Well.
Are you ready?
I want to see the plane first.
Only the highest bidder will have that privilege.
Is it really invisible?
How long have you been in Budapest?
Well, you' ve probably driven past it at least half a dozen times.
Now, if you' d enter your bid into the computer.
I usually make the predictions, but let' s do a little flip.
Let' s let Cedric make the predictions.
Hey, you stop jokes now.
- I will!
Isn' t he a doll?
"I will stop them!" I like that.
Give them a preview.
Open- handed.
Let' s see how fast you are.
Y' all like to see that, wouldn' t you?
Open- handed scrap?
Put your hands up.
What you got?
That' s what you coming with?
You' re gonna get your ass whipped.
I' il hit your jaw.
Put your guard up, now.
I' m pretty fast, now.
Here it come.
I told you I would slap you.
What' s wrong with you, coming all hard like that?
You' re supposed to give them a taste.
You wanna hit me hard.
What if I kick your ass in front of everybody?
Robinson vs. Mills.
The transatlantic championship...... tomorrow night, here in Budapest.
- Done.
- Excellent.
Well, the best of luck.
Would you care for champagne?
We have an excellent fountain.
Yes.
What you doing, hanging from the ceiling like that?
What are you doing?
You' re supposed to be outside.
- I figured you' d need help.
Don' t tell me what to do.
I' m Kelly Robinson.
57 and 0.
Don' t talk to me like that.
What' s wrong?
You tripped the alarm.
Yeah, you tripped it.
I didn' t trip no alarm.
I don' t hear it.
See this?
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah, oh, shit.
Come here.
We' il get caught because you didn' t tell me about the alarm.
- This is your fault.
- What is this?
- It' s a mask.
Put it on.
- This look like a sock.
- It' s a mask.
Put it on.
Look like a sock.
Hey, man, this is a sock!
What you doing?
Putting this on.
Let me do this.
Quit tickling me.
Would you come here?
- Just tell me what' s going on.
- I am losing it.
I' m nervous and ticklish at the same time.
Not in my wildest imagination did I dream it would be this difficult.
Before you enter your bid, Mr. Abi, let me remind you...... that an undetectable nuclear delivery system....
- Why we spinning?
- Be still.
- Don' t breathe.
- We can' t spin like this.
- I' m getting queasy...... and I don' t like heights.
And I' m spinning, and I' m gonna vomit.
What kind of cheap- ass equipment they send you on this mission with?
- The anchor broke.
- You check the anchor first.
I wasn' t expecting you to be here.
Hey, that' s cool.
I would like you to enjoy our local specialty.
Please, I need a few moments alone.
- Don' t worry.
You' il get your chance.
Enjoy.
Get on the roof.
- Just go through the opening.
- Go through it.
- Lock this wing down.
I was born semipsychic, and I had a hunch something would happen.
- Then why' d you go into the room?
- I ain' t Miss Cleo.
It' s like you' re a double agent.
Like you' re working against me.
- I liked this better when it was a test!
- We gotta jump!
- You crazy?
I ain' t jumping.
No, but you better come up with something.
Wait right here.
What you gonna do?
Don' t leave me.
- What' s that?
- Okay, that wasn' t that bad.
- What' d I say?
Let' s do it.
Always have a sure way out.
Walk, walk, walk.
Now we run.
Now we run.
- This is your sure way out?
- It' s the way to the sure way out.
- Go through it.
- Come on, man!
Could you move?
Look out.
Are we still on the way to the sure way, or is this it?
This is the sure way out.
Okay.
Come on.
I' m nervous.
- Don' t panic.
- Look how slow we moving!
Kelly, it' s here.
We are home free, my friend.
There' s a guy coming.
Kick him.
Kick him in the balls!
How I' m gonna kick him if he got a gun?
- Don' t be defeatist!
- Hey, watch out!
They' re gonna kill Kelly Robinson.
Don' t be negative.
Hey, that guy' s still coming.
I' m gonna get him.
- Tell me when.
Now?
- No!
- Now?
- Now!
- Throw it.
- What' s this?
- Smoke grenade.
- They got bullets and we got smoke?
It' s smoking.
- Now what?
Grab this.
I knew you had something up your sleeve.
- I never doubted you.
- That' s right.
- Yeah.
How we gonna get down from here?
I don' t think we' re gonna have to worry about that.
Okay, you worried now?
I' m a little worried now.
We' il bring her gently down on that grassy hill there.
Brace yourself!
What?
Hey, what happened to the soft, grassy hill?
We missed it.
Let go when I say so.
You wanna die?
We' ve dodged some bullets...... and I don' t know how many more lives we' ve got.
We gotta let go.
Ready?
Let go!
I broke my leg.
It' s broken.
That' s what your ass gets for this crazy balloon shit.
- No, it' s okay.
- I wish it was broke.
- They' re still coming.
- Man, these guys won' t give up.
- I wish that balloon worked better.
The balloon is over!
What are we gonna do?
Let me think.
I got an idea.
Move around.
Get in the car.
You' ve got an idea?
This I want to see.
Now you be in the hot seat.
I used to be in a different business.
- What are you doing?
- They keep the keys here.
You used to transport cars?
You did it.
Show them something there.
- Okay, I got an idea.
- What you gonna do?
- You inspired me.
We' re gonna try a little Carlos.
- What are you doing?
- Pull forward.
- What?
- Pull forward.
- Did you see that?
- Goddamn!
- That was a big explosion.
- Everyone thinks he' s great.
- He' s got more potent bombs.
- His bombs are more potent?
That ain' t right.
Another one!
Here they come.
This one' s mine.
Let me show you something they don' t teach over at the BNS.
That' s pretty good.
- You were unbelievable back there.
- That was you.
You had the thing going down, the Kelly Robinson -- I had one little bomb.
- It was like --
- You' re crazy.
- Here they are.
- Good driving.
- Kelly Robinson, Kelly Robinson.
What we got here?
Hey, no outlet in here.
We stuck, man.
Pull right here.
Give me the keys.
Look what I got!
Convertible.
You take that car.
Jump on!
Kelly Robinson ain' t getting on no scooter like no bitch.
Okay, let' s do it.
Come on, man.
Get your feet up.
Hold on!
Okay, hold on.
Shit!
Go, go, go!
- Yeah, it' s a nightmare.
They shooting, and I' m in the back.
- We' il make a break for daylight.
What' s that smell?
Oh, man.
Go down the tunnel.
Is there an opening?
There' s bars and shit over here.
We can' t get out.
Just stand back to the side.
Oh, shit!
You okay?
You ask me, am I okay!
You made $24 million last year?
Yeah, 24. 7.
- It' s late night.
- We' il wait them out.
Just don' t breathe in too deep.
Methane.
Methane' il make you loopy.
I' m gonna get loopy from standing and breathing in this human....
You know what this is, right?
This is the nastiest place in all of Hungary.
Yes.
It feels kind of dizzy.
Okay.
- Where' d you grow up?
- Hey, man...... no offense, but I ain' t one of those guys that, you know...... start pouring his heart out and get personal with another guy...... so save it for somebody else.
My grandmother.
No kidding?
Yeah, she' s the one that put the time in.
The day- to- day, you know, feeding, and you know.
Sweet!
The sweetest thing you ever wanna meet.
Angel.
My grandmother' s the first person ever punched me in the face.
None of that hard shit, a jab, just to let me know she was serious.
Parents don' t take the time anymore.
I mean, only --
You got to love somebody' s baby to punch a baby in the face.
That' s all.
Keep digging.
I mean, I put on a show, but inside, man, lots of time I be crying.
Tell me.
You and I are basically the same guy.
Take away my money?
It' s a metaphor.
Take away all your women.
- You know what I' m saying?
- Yeah, I know.
- No, I' m you.
- Yeah, that' s what I mean.
We' re twins.
Oh, I' ve got a crush on Rachel for years.
I just love her power.
And sexy and -- You saw the way she threw me over.
It was just like I was nothing.
Just a powerful woman.
You know what?
I' il tell you what.
If you feel that way about a girl...
-... then you got to act on it.
- Oh, I do.
You see how it is when I try to talk to her.
- You gotta -- - Fumbling over myself --
I see, but you need to change that.
- Be honest.
- Hey, I ain' t gonna lie to you.
I don' t have the savoir- faire, that devilish charm.
- I' ve seen you, and I don' t have that.
I disagree.
No, I' m not gonna sit here and listen to your --
Bust it, bust it.
You do have savoir- faire.
You just have to unleash it.
You know, if you forget that this is a sewer, it' s kind of a beautiful place.
I thought you two were dead.
- Gundars' men had us pinned.
No.
Have you been tracking the pen?
It' s at the palace.
He moved until 1: 30...... and it' s been in the bedroom since.
He' s not onto us.
Let us know, Jim, the minute that pen moves.
The plane is still in Budapest, but the deal' s going down today.
Bob, get a helicopter in the air.
Scan every rooftop, parking lot, playground in the city.
UV, infrared, throw everything you got at it.
We' re on it.
Tired.
You must be exhausted.
What a night.
I was driving around, looking for you all night.
We' il give a yell if the pen moves.
Sure you guys can handle this?
You' ve been working hard.
I' m sure he got this covered.
Take a nap.
I' m glad you' re okay.
Thank you.
Oh, yeah.
I know what you thinking, and the answer is yes, playboy.
- Yes.
You going in there.
- I' m not going in there.
You are going, and you gonna be devilishly charming.
- This isn' t one of your floozies.
- It' s a girl.
She' s special.
You gotta put her on a pedestal.
Well, we don' t have a pedestal.
All we got is a cot in the back.
- I' il do it tomorrow.
- No, today...... right now on the cot in the back.
- I don' t know.
- Okay.
- Let' s do it.
Let' s do it.
I' il show you how we' il do it.
I' m gonna unleash your savoir- faire.
Hey, it' s me, Alex.
Alex?
I love the way you say my name.
It' s the way the L flicks off your tongue...... when you say the L in Alex.
It' s like, "Alex, Alex, Alex."
Just let me hear you say it.
What are you doing?
What am I doing?
I' m just....
I' m getting ready to make love to you so good and long...... you' il be begging me to stop and keep going at the same time.
I' il tell you what I' m doing.
Now that I see that you are, you' re all tucked in, doing fine...... I' m gonna go back out.
Everything' s fine here.
Don' t worry about us.
Go back to sleep.
I' il just....
That' s not what I said.
Get back in there!
Your rap' s not working.
We did our best.
No shame in that.
Kelly Robinson' s rap works!
This is good shit.
Give me --
I just wanna....
Let me just take a -- Just collect myself for a second.
That' s good.
I' m gonna give you my secret weapon.
This shit always works.
Look in her eyes.
Now sing.
Say that.
lnside of me.
Rising.
Rising and....
When I get that feeling...... I need sexual healing.
Sexual -- I know, it sounds crazy.
I' m probably delirious, but it just makes me feel so fine.
And it' s good for us.
It' s sexual.
Okay?
You' re cute.
I' ve always had a little crush on you.
You did?
- My gosh.
Good Lord.
Shit, yeah, that' s what I' m talking about.
Now go over there, and bite her on the ass real hard.
- No!
- Yes!
- No, no, no, no.
- No?
- Yes?
- Bite her.
Bite her!
- No?
No, yes.
Go back to where you were.
Bite!
Bite her!
They love that shit.
Don' t break the skin, but bite it good so that there' s a mark on her ass.
She' il show all her friends.
"Look at my mark, what he did."
I know what you want.
It' s okay.
You can trust me.
- My -- - You okay?
But in a good way.
Hey!
Hey, come on, now.
Let me at least see the goods.
Let' s go!
Let' s move!
- Pen moved.
- Are you sure?
- Come on.
Yes.
Wait.
Why is he going to the baths?
Stakeout.
Stakeout, guys.
This needs a stakeout.
- Wait a second.
You too, okay?
Come on, man.
Come on.
- All right.
- They' il give me a parade.
Confetti and all that shit.
Kelly Day.
Kelly Robinson Day parade.
Nasty as hell up in here.
It smells like ass soup all over the place.
- What?
Maybe the walls are too thick in here.
No, no.
Something' s wrong.
Come on.
We can' t walk away from this.
You' re fired up.
But sometimes you move forward, sometimes back.
Hell, no!
Listen to me.
I got a hunch on this.
That' s a high ratio!
Like, here, in this area...... I' m vibing this.
Right now, I know the plane is in here.
Hey!
What you know about the Leafy Bug?
What?
- Kick your ass if I find it in here.
Hell, yeah.
Come on, now.
You don' t feel that?
- There' s nothing in here.
- You must be crazy.
I feel something.
I feel it.
Something' s definitely going on.
What' s your name, boy?
He talking all that shit because he knows something.
Something' s in here.
I feel it.
You know what?
We learned we can' t trust your gut.
I told you --
Maybe the plane' s over there in the whirlpool.
- Maybe those three out of 10 -- - Gun!
A vibe!
Like a fool, I listened!
I followed you in here.
Why would I have a way out?
- Trying to hit the pipes.
We' il create a spark.
Go!
I got it.
It' s gonna blow!
There goes Gundars!
Rachel!
Rachel, no!
It' s a setup!
No!
No!
Man!
Let' s go.
- That' s it?
- Yeah, Kelly, that' s it.
Shit!
- You all right?
- What do you think?
I think you' re messed up, and you need to talk.
Rachel' s dead!
She' s dead because I' ve been listening to you.
You' re upset.
Rachel was a good woman.
She was a good woman, and she' s gone.
You' re still here, though, semipsychic guy.
You ain' t blaming that back there on me.
Who could blame you?
You' re the king of the universe.
You want Kelly Robinson Day.
You' il get it.
- Slow it down.
I don' t like your tone.
Really?
Is that one of your hunches?
Or some of the normal crap that comes out of your mouth?
I' m not you.
Thank God, I' m not you!
- I would hate to be you.
That' s the last straw.
I got to whup your ass now.
- You wanna fight me?
- I' il whip your ass!
Let me take off my jacket.
This is gonna amuse me.
If going to the dentist is amusing, then this is getting ready to be funny.
- There' s no ref here.
- I don' t need no referee.
From this position, I know 11 ways I can totally immobilize you.
Huh?
If it was my right, you' d be drinking meat through a straw.
Will you look at surfer boy!
Hey, shit!
If that had gone 6 inches higher, you' d be in a coma right now.
You okay?
Throw kicks like a little bitch!
Hands up!
What' s going on here?
The black guy mugged me!
Wait!
Why am I being arrested?
This is bullshit!
He kicked me first!
He kicked me in my nuts!
- Yeah?
- Alex.
I' ve been calling for three hours!
I know.
We hit a few snags.
I' m sending backup now.
What' s your location?
- It' s all fine.
- It' s all fine?
I' m headed to the castle tonight.
I' il try to track Gundars to the plane.
I knew you' d screw this up.
I gotta go, Mac.
I gotta go.
Dude never been this late.
- Kelly!
Where you been?
- Better yet, who you been with?
He ain' t our problem no more.
Let' s go down here and get 58.
I feel like I just won the lottery.
It' s funny, isn' t it?
You winning makes me rich.
My government' s point of view is that no price is too high.
So how' s your golf game?
I haven' t had much time since I' ve been here.
Driver, take the car off the bridge, away from the traffic.
That' s the whole point, isn' t it?
That you can' t see it.
- That' s what you' re buying, isn' t it?
Thank you.
Come on.
Finally!
Now you' il believe me when I tell you...... that you' ve driven past it half a dozen times.
It is the most incredible thing I have ever seen.
Shall we conclude our business?
I expect you to conduct yourself professionally.
- You ready to do this?
It looks like my computer is a billion dollars healthier.
Which makes you the proud owner...... of the most advanced piece of weaponry on the planet.
Watch this.
The ignition code.
Round one for the super middleweight...
-... championship of the world!
Mills goes right to work.
I' m working.
That looks like an old- fashioned thermonuclear warhead.
- They won' t think so in Washington.
- Tell them!
- Do as he says.
Get your hands up!
You too, Mr. Zhu Tam.
Do it!
You didn' t think you could fool BNS, did you?
- Rachel?
- I guess we did.
- You' re alive?
- Don' t tell anyone.
Combination to the head.
Body shots by the challenger, Mills.
The whole "I' m dead" thing.
- You certainly do.
- You really should have caught it.
Yeah, I should have.
I guess I was a little distracted by the sound of my heart breaking.
Code invalid.
That' s not good.
Is that good?
- What the hell did you do?
- I entered the ignition code.
Self- destruct sequence activated.
No, that is the correct code.
I saw Lt. Percy fire the engine myself.
Just get it handled, Agent Wright.
That' s what you' re paid to do.
He ain' t done nothing to earn your respect!
It' s number 58 going down right now.
- 58.
- Good, yeah.
The code times out?
ln case the plane were stolen?
I assume you know the correct code.
Assumptions have a way of coming back and kicking you in your ass.
Robinson measuring Mills up.
A wicked left hook by Robinson.
- How much is he paying you?
- I don' t have time for this.
I know that hurt.
The code, Alex.
Robinson dancing around.
What' s going on here?
It looks like he' s fighting an invisible opponent.
Unbelievable!
Rachel, you' re not getting this plane off the bridge.
Kelly Robinson is down for the first time in his career!
- Let' s go.
Fight!
Now it' s gonna get messy.
- Five.
- Come on, come on!
Eight.
- He' s not gonna make it.
You' re out!
It' s over!
Kelly Robinson is still...... the super middleweight champion of the world!
I' m impressed, Alex.
You' re tougher than I thought.
There' s one thing that will always make a man talk.
Cutting my belt?
- Take off his pants.
- Take off my pants?
Hold it.
Wait a second.
Come on, take it easy.
- You turned on the eye thing...
-... so I had to come save your ass!
- I did?
That must mean you really love me.
Don' t get this twisted.
I did this to secure my parade!
- No getting around it.
You love me.
- This is for the parade!
- Parade!
- It' s love!
- Love!
Move!
I' m starting to regret this shit!
Move!
Go!
Hold your fire!
Who the hell is this guy?
It' s Carlos.
I guess Mac sent him in as backup for us.
He' s like a superspy.
He' s a spy, the same as me.
Not a superspy.
He got a fly- ass ninja outfit and parachute.
Gundars!
Tell your men to put down their weapons.
Down!
Alex, the code before we all blow up.
That' s what I' m doing.
I was on my way to do it.
- Doing fine before you got here.
- Mr. Zhu Tam, I believe.
Carlos, careful.
Rachel' s a double agent!
Yes, I know, Alex.
Yours too, Rachel.
Apparently, you' ve been a bad girl.
Wait a second.
-... this James Bond is with Rachel.
- Not now.
I can feel it right now.
I said, not now.
Let me figure this out!
How did big shot know she was bad?
I got 45 seconds to figure out this logarithmic code...... or we' il all die because we' il blow up.
Why don' t you stick to your perfume ads and leave the espionage to me?
No, don' t say that to him.
It' s cologne.
No, Kelly!
Here we go.
- Come on.
Eighteen, seventeen...... sixteen....
Sequence aborted.
I got it.
No, I don' t.
Don' t do it!
Put that shit down.
Put the gun down right now.
Putting it down.
But I' m on your side.
I' m with BNS.
Bitch that Need Slapping?
I tried to make sure Carlos doesn' t get to this computer.
Think I believe that?
What' s wrong with you?
- Hear her trying to flip the script?
- She' s saying she' s good?
This should be rich.
We' ve suspected Carlos was dirty for months.
Mac and me teamed up with him so we could nail him.
- Why didn' t they tell me?
- You know how this works.
You know that.
Mac didn' t want you protecting me at the wrong time.
That' s all Carlos would have needed.
- He is?
- If he knew how we felt --
Don' t be creeping up and shit.
She got long legs.
She' il kick you.
He' s always known I wanted to work with you.
- Yeah.
What, like on a stakeout?
Don' t you know how I feel about you?
- That' s bullshit.
- Can' t deny it.
I feel the same -- - You dizzy from massive blood loss...... because the bitch stabbed you 15 minutes ago!
I could have crippled him for life if I wanted to.
- You' ve got full mobility in your leg?
- It doesn' t feel that bad.
Son of a gun.
I had no idea.
Carlos was jealous of us?
Enough.
I can' t listen to this shit.
What' s wrong with you?
You booty- blinded right now.
It' s like being snow- blinded with no snow, just a cute piece of ass.
She' s telling the truth.
You don' t understand the spy world.
There are double agents, and there are pseudo- double agents.
It' s actually pretty standard stuff.
Yeah.
It' s pretty standard.
Look out!
Alex, you idiot!
I' ve had enough of this!
There' s Vitalis and shit all over --
He was coming like a buzz saw.
If you didn' t grab him, he was gonna kill me.
It was like looking in the eyes of the devil.
Where' s Rachel?
She gone.
Didn' t I tell you that bitch was bad?
Why didn' t you keep an eye on her?
- You said she was good!
- You can' t listen to what I say.
I' m delusional!
You said yourself I' m booty- blind.
I' m blinded by ass.
You blinded now, but a minute ago --
You two fools just let Rachel escape with Gundars' computer?
That has all the passwords to his numbered accounts.
It' s worth billions of dollars!
Mac knew you would screw this up.
That' s why he sent me --
"Worth billions of dollars."
You hear this guy?
He' s still a bad guy, right?
Yeah, he -- Well, I don' t know.
Everybody keeps flip- flopping around.
I can' t keep it straight.
It' s murky.
- You said it was standard -- - I know what I said!
It' s murky when there ain' t no girl involved, huh?
I' il tell you one thing.
Good or bad, I' m tying this guy up.
We tie everybody up.
Why don' t you stop stressing?
There' s the Leafy Bug, baby.
That' s what we set out to do, and we got it!
We got the plane.
We heroes.
- You' re right.
Let' s go home.
- You wanna see something cool?
Man, that is some superfly, superspy shit!
Let me see.
- Just press that button.
- Okay.
Gotta get that on my cars.
Visible.
Invisible.
Visible --
- Don' t wear out the battery.
- Let me have some fun.
- It loses its specialness.
Give it back.
Why you gotta be tripping?
- You broke it.
- I broke the shit?
How I break it?
I broke it?
You happy now?
How will I explain this?
I show up with the plane and a broken remote.
There' s dead bodies all over the roof.
You think they' il care about that?
- Come on, man!
Let' s go.
- We' re heroes.
- Maybe so.
- I' il definitely get a parade behind this.
Settle back, and I' m gonna fire this baby up.
And that is why they call it the Switchblade.
Ready for the ride of your life?
Yeah, let' s do this.
Got a little wrinkle.
Kelly Robinson ain' t supposed to go out like this!
I' m supposed to die in the ring!
Come here.
I ain' t okay.
You just crashed my parade down into the river.
Then the thrust manifold went all haywire.
Huh?
This is perfect!
Now thanks to you, I ain' t a hero!
- What is that?
- That' s a bomb!
- What?
That' s a thermonuclear bomb.
No, it' s okay.
It' s not armed.
Can you imagine if this had gone off?
This would have killed millions!
- And they didn' t arm it?
- They didn' t get a chance to.
You know why they didn' t get a chance to?
We stopped them.
Know what that means?
- I think so.
- We heroes again!
- Damn, you' re right.
- Bet your pink ass I' m right!
We' re heroes again!
Even without the plane.
- We' re heroes!
- This is the proof right here!
- This bomb.
- I can' t wait to call the president.
We gonna get the Congressional Medal of Honor and a parade!
This will be fantastic.
Has my bank transfer come through?
Not yet, Ms. Tessio.
You forgot your drink.
Alex, how are you?
- Came prepared this time.
Back up.
You thought you was gonna get away?
Thought you was gonna make a fool out of Kelly Robinson?
When I have my parade, I' il tie your ass to the front of a float.
Alex?
How about a stakeout in Greece for two weeks?
Two weeks?
I know.
There' s no harm in --
You taking a long time.
Tell her no.
No!
- No.
- In fact, say, "Hell, no!"
- Hell, no.
- Hell, no, bitch!
Sorry.
The spell wore off.
Well, boys, I' m glad you guys got all the news coverage.
- What' s that mean?
- Always got to have the last word.
She always gotta say some shit, huh?
What she talking about, news coverage?
Is that Carlos?
- "Superspy hero thwarts --" - Carlos was good.
- We the ones that saved the day!
Yes!
Look at the spectacle and the glitter and shit!
That' s my parade!
He stole my parade!
- I don' t know what to say.
Bullshit!
Bullshit!
Bullshit!
We gotta go to Washington and get debriefed.
- I don' t blame you.
It' s just, I was looking forward to testing out the hover gel with you.
- The whatsit gel?
- Hover.
It' s a gelatinous hydrogen diphyoxide.
It' s 12 times lighter than air.
You smear it all over your body...... and if you' re in an oxygen- rich environment...... it allows you to float down to earth like a bird.
Like a jelly bird?
Yeah.
That' s the street name for it.
"Jelly Bird." Exactly.
They have a couple on the transport plane.
Plan was, they drop us off over D. C., and we float down like birds.
There' s press and photographers.
It' s gonna be a whole spectacle, but....
What we waiting on?
Let' s do this.
- You' il do it?
- Hell, yeah, I' il do it!
Let' s go right now.
I used to always dream I' d be able to fly.
- My grandma said I was a fool.
- See, I told her and -- - Hold on.

Hiya, Bruce.
How ya feelin '?
Grub okay in here for ya?
What do you want?
That' s a good question.
See, I need your cells to trigger some chemical distress signals.
You know, so you can turn a little green for me again... and I can carve off a piece of the real you, analyze it, patent it, make a fortune.
Do you mind?
I' il never let you.
I' m not sure you' ve got much of a choice.
Come on, Bruce.
After all, you' ve only got me to play with now that Betty' s dumped you and gone back to Berkeley.
You' re lying.
You know, for me this is a win- win situation.
You turn green, and all these guys come in and kill you... and I perform the autopsy.
And I mop the floor with you... and maybe by accident go too far and break your neck.
Bad science, maybe... but personally gratifying.
Come on, Bruce!
Let' s see what you got.
Never.
You know, consciously you may control it, but subconsciously, I bet that' s another story.
All right, let' s jump- start those brain waves.
- My dear Miss Ross.
There are two guards right outside.
I' m not angry with you.
What do you want?
It' s over for me now.
And soon it' il be over for Bruce.
That' s why I' ve come to you... to ask you if you could persuade your father, as a man, as a father himself, that if I turn myself in now, peacefully... and before he puts me away forever, that he would let me see my son... for one last time.
Could you do that for me?
It' s out of my father' s hands now.
I understand.
He' s a puppet now.
I don' t blame him.
You shouldn' t.
You should blame yourself for what you' ve done to your son.
And what have I done to my son, Miss Ross?
Nothing.
I tried to improve on the limits in myself.
Not him!
Can you understand?
To improve on nature.
My nature!
Knowledge of oneself!
It' s the only path to the truth... that give men the power to go beyond God' s boundaries!
You know what' s beyond your boundaries?
All you' ve given Bruce is fear.
Fear of life.
Fear?
Perhaps, Miss Ross.
And loneliness too.
I feel them both.
But I have lived... completely once.
I was so much in love, and she so much wanted a baby.
I could tell from the moment she conceived... that it wasn' t a son I had given her... but something else.
A monster, maybe.
I should have put a stop to it right then, but I was curious and that was my downfall.
And as I watched this tiny life unfold,
I began to imagine the horror of it, and my curiosity was replaced... with compassion.
But they took away my chance to cure him.
Your father threw me out.
- What are you doing?
- I remember that day so well... every moment, every sensation... walking into the house, the feeling of the handle of the knife in my hand.
I knew I was doing a father' s work, fulfilling a father' s mercy.
David, please stop it.!
David, no.!
But then she surprised me.
It was as if... she and the knife... merged.
No!
You cannot imagine... the unbearable finality of it.
I took everything that was dear to me... and transformed it into nothing more... than a memory.
Bingo!
That must be some jumbo nightmare he just had.
Start the enzyme extraction.
Sir, negative on drill penetration.
Damn it, drill him harder!
Come on, Holeman!
- Should I neutralize?
I can' t do anything with goop!
- All right, put him to sleep.
It' s not stopping him.!
Non- lethals only.
I must have a sample of him.
Sir.!
- Jesus!
- Hit him with the foam.
Deploy containment foam.
Talbot, talk to me.
Cease fire!
I' il let you know if we need you.
Unacceptable.
Unseat your asses down here immediately.
I want a full- court evacuation now.
I' m shutting you down.
Didn' t you hear what the general said?
I said lockdown!
Clear!
I need a sample of him!
Take it easy there, buddy.
This might give you a bit of a sting here, Bruce.
Fall back!
Clear it!
Give me the M2.
So long, big boy.
Lockdown the entire facility immediately.
Target' s still moving towards blue level.
- Evacuate the main hall.
Send in backup, heavy weapons.
Issue general quarters.
Contamination, sir.
System readings are redline.
Data' s on backup power supply.
Incoming!
Shut down all power to the main hall.
Show him the way out.
Driver, stop.
Gunner, traverse left.!
Mr. President, I have some bad news, sir.
Let' s have it, General.
I' ve briefed the president on Angry Man.
I assume that' s what this is about.
It is, ma' am.
I' m requesting a National Command Authority override.
Angry Man is unsecure.
I need everything we have at my disposal in order to stop his movement.
You' re expecting civilian casualties, General?
Not if I can help it, ma' am.
Keep us posted.
Contact Goodman Control.
Patch data to the assets.
Contact H. Q.
Have them initiate an immediate evacuation... in vicinity of grid coordinates 653- 216...
Confirm that the area has been cleared.
Confirm area cleared.
H. Q. Confirms area cleared.
Gentlemen, it' s time to dig in.
I want this target stopped in his tracks.
Jesus.
Mayday.!
Mayday.!
Ah, shit.!
Tango Four is down.
Have C- SAR respond to our 20 ASAP.
We' re okay, but, damn it, get him off us before he tears us apart.!
I' ve got no shot.
Watch it, Tango Flight.
Tango Three, pull back and set up for a Hellfire shot.
Hold your fire till we draw him off.
Tango One is hot.
Gun wazzed.
Going hot.
Engage at will.
Tango One, pull back.!
Tango Flight, clear back.
I' ve got him painted for Hellfire.
Take the shot.
Tango One, Tango Three.
I have contact.
Holy shit.!
He' s got my missile.!
Mayday!
Mayday!
Mayday!
We' re hit!
Give me a head count.
Tango Three, give me a sit rep.
Tango Flight, do you have eyes on the target?
I have him in the rocks.
Salvo all.
Turn it into a parking lot.
T- bolt, your parking lot is ready.
We' re bingo for fuel and ammo.
Be advised, target not destroyed.
He' s on the move again.
Damn!
It appears he' s heading home.
Have them intercept and engage.
Hello?
Betty, Bruce got out.
He' s headed your way... and probably right for you.
How far from the base are you?
They' re taking his father in now.
That' s all good news.
Stay there, Betty.
Legend One rolling in hot.
Legend Two breaking offleft.
I think I can come back around for a gun attack.
Acquire a clear target.
Increase altitude.
You' re headed for the bridge.!
I can' t pull up!
Take him on a ride to the top of the world.
Let' s see what the thin air will do for him.
Initiating afterburner.
I' m passing flight level 600.
This is out of my envelope.
Hang in there, Legend.
I can' t maintain.
He' s all over my aerodynamics.
He' il lose consciousness before you.
Nine- fifty.
I can' t hold it.
I' m pulling back!
Puny human.
Let' s not take any chances.
You are cleared to fire on target, Legend.
Dad?
Betty?
We don' t have a choice.
I have to destroy him.
But you can' t.
You will only fuel his rage, and you will make him stronger.
It' s you he' s coming for.
Then let me go to him.
Please.
Just give him a chance to calm down.
This area has been declared restricted airspace.
All aircraft are ordered to clear the airspace immediately.
Weapons are hot.
Target acquired.
Waiting your orders to engage.
Hold for authorization.
All units, hold your fire.
You have direct orders to hold your fire.
I repeat, hold your fire.
You found me.
You weren' t that hard to find.
Yes, I was.
He stays on this base... until we get the final word from C- 3 on how to dispose of him.
In the meantime, ifhe does anything but sit there in that chair, we' re gonna turn on the juice and he' il be incinerated immediately.
We' ve established a 200- yard perimeter, sir.
If we deploy the electromagnetic array, there should be no collateral damage.
I' m doin 'this for you, Betty.
But one way or another, we' re gonna have to prepare for the worst.
I should have killed you.
And I should have killed you.
I wish you had.
I saw her last night.
Saw her face.
Brown eyes.
She smiled at me.
She reached down and kissed my cheek.
I can almost remember a smell.
Almost like desert flowers.
Her favorite perfume.
It' s my mother, and I don' t even know her name.
It' s all right, son.
You go ahead and cry.
Crying will do you good.
Don' t touch me!
Maybe once you were my father, but you' re not now and you never will be.
Oh, is that so?
Well, I got news for you.
I came here to see my son.
The one inside of you.
You' re nothing but a superficial shell, a husk of flimsy consciousness... ready to be torn off at a moment' s notice.
You can think what you like.
I don' t care.
Listen to me.
I found a cure.
For me.
My cells can transform too, absorb enormous amounts of energy.
But, unlike you, they' re unstable.
Son, I need your strength.
Only a million times more radiant, more powerful!
- Stop it.
Stop what?
Think about all those men out there in their uniforms... barking and swallowing orders, inflicting their petty rule over the entire globe!
Think of all the harm they' ve done!
To you!
To humanity!
And know this... that we can make them... and their flags and their anthems and their governments... disappear in a flash!
You in me.
I' d rather die.
Oh, that' s your answer?
Then indeed you shall die... and be reborn... a hero... of the kind that walked the earth...
long before the pale religions of civilization... infected humanity' s soul!
Go!
Stop your bawling, you weak little speck of human trash.
I' il go!
- You just watch me go!
- Hit it.
- Hit it again!
Some kind of counter- electromagnetic field.
Move in and assault the target.
Sir, I' ve located them on radar.
Call up the task force.
Yes!
That' s right.
Keep fighting.
The more you fight, the more of you I take.
Strange.
But simultaneous radiological activity.
They' re absorbing all the ambient energy.
Sleep now, Bruce, and forget forever.
Struggle no more... and give me all of your power.
You think you can live with it?
Take it all!
Oh, yes!
Take it back!
It' s not stopping!
Take it back!
Gentlemen... release.
Gamma charge away.
- Sweet dreams.
Hello?
Betty, is that you?
I' m glad I caught you.
I' m glad you called.
Look, Betty... you and I... well, we both know that Bruce couldn' t have survived that blast.
But... well, you know...
Seein 'things.
Right.
Look, uh... if by some chance he did survive... and he should try to contact you, try to get in touch, you' d tell me, wouldn' t you?
No...
But you know as well as I do, I wouldn' t have to.
I' m under surveillance.
I' m the last person I would want him to come to... because... as much as I miss him,
I... loved him.
I' m sorry, Betty.
I am so sorry.
I know you are.
Let' s take a walk.
23. 976
Before you' re born... someone, maybe God, defines exactly how he' s going to fuck your life.
This was my theory.
God only thinks about men at the start... when He decides whether their life is going to be good or bad.
If He' s in a hurry, He makes a war, or a tornado... and kills off a whole bunch of people without a thought.
But He did think about me.
'THE MAN OF THE YEAR'
So, have you chosen?
- This one.
- Nowadays men are like women.
Liposuction, waxing, getting rid of wrinkles, peeling, botox, everything.
For instance, now it' s trendy for men to dye their hair blond.
- Yesterday, I did two myself.
- In my case it was a bet.
I don' t like my clients looking.
Spoils the surprise.
- What bet was that?
- Soccer.
Losing is terrible.
Who lost?
Me.
Oh, my God.
I shouldn' t have left it so long, but...
I think you' il like it.
Hope so.
It' s nearly platinum blonde.
What' s wrong, didn' t you like it?
I can dye it again, if you want.
I' ve always thought I was ugly.
Never enjoyed looking in the mirror.
But on that day it was different.
I looked at that face that was mine but wasn' t mine.
A blond... a stranger.
I spent my whole life wishing Iwere someone else.
And there I felt my time had come.
What are you doing tonight?
So, what are we going to do?
I wanted to take Cledir to a motel and fuck all night long.
But I' d promise to pass by Gonzaga' s bar... and show my cousin Robinson that I' d paid my debt.
I could' ve gone there another time, but I felt like going right then.
I was feeling good... and wanted to show everyone the new Máiquel.
Where' s Robinson?
- What the fuck' s that?
What am I, a clown?
You look funny.
- In what way, brother?
- What do you mean?
Just funny.
You look like a gringo.
You telling me I look like a fag?
You walk in here looking like a gringo and I can' t think it' s funny?
What' s your problem?
I' not a faggot and I' m not a clown.
I don' t like you laughing when I walk in here.
That' s the problem.
Look, Máiquel...
I didn' t call you a fag...
but I am now.
If you ask me... any man who dyes his hair blond like that, like you did... has to be a fag, and big time.
C' mon.
Weren' t we going to dance?
Máiquel, come and have a beer with us, man.
Go fuck yourself.
Don' t mess around with that guy.
Forget it.
You' re the faggot, Suel.
Let' s go outside settle this shit like men.
Come on, let' s go!
- I' m so scared of you.
- Let' s go!
Stop that now!
No fighting in my bar!
I' m with my girlfriend tonight.
I' il deal with you another time.
Whenever you like, Blondie.
- Let' s go.
- Tomorrow.
Midday, here.
I couldn' t sleep at night thinking about Suel.
And my tooth was killing me.
I shouldn' t have done that.
I had gotten myself in a duel.
Suel surely had a gun.
I had never held a gun before, damn it.
I was going to stay home quiet, and forget that guy.
Fuck him.
I wasn' t gonna go out.
Reach for your gun, Suel.
Fire away, Blondie.
That' s how things began.
In this stupid way.
I never thought I' d kill someone.
And all because of a bet.
DAY OF SADNESS AND GLORY AT MARACANÃ
I wanted to run away, to leave town but I just stood... standing there.
I was afraid of Suel' s friends, afraid of the cops, of going to jail.
I just wanted to put an end to that agony.
I was going to hand myself in.
- Hand yourself in, like hell!
- Like hell!
I told you not to mess with Suel!
- You' ve got to get away fast.
- Take that car you' ve been using...... and go to the countryside.
- No, the Maverick' s due tomorrow!
You should go further, up to the northeast.
Fuck, Marcão!
People hide over in Niterói.
Why don' t you dye your hair black and stay right here?
Hey, Máiquel!
Suel was a fucking thief.
He took boxes of booze... and said that if I told the cops he' d set fire to the bar.
No one liked him around here.
Plus the fucker was under age and couldn' t be arrested.
He deserved to die.
Go on, drink your whisky.
I' il just have a Coke, no ice.
He' s the one who shot Suel.
Good work.
Helping keep the trash off the streets.
Let' s go.
I felt it was still too early for me to feel safe.
But everybody was thanking me, giving me presents.
I never thought that people would be happy with the death of a guy.
They said that criminals belong in the cemetery... and that I had done society some good.
Who farted there, man?
Shit, man.
- Stinks!
- Gross, man!
That stinks!
Fuck!
Just a minute.
Trumps.
Pass.
So tell us how you knocked that guy out.
Showing off...
Had a girlfriend, didn' t he?
- Wonder where she' s gone.
- She can go fuck herself.
I...
I...
I...
Go on, Enoque, spit it out!
- It was nobody.
- What do you mean, nobody?
Nobody.
Mr. Baldani sent this.
Told me to congratulate you.
Congratulations.
Bye.
Bill Clinton' s visit to Brazil... was marked by a breach of protocol.
At the Mangueira Olympic village... the American retinue was half an hour late.
They were applauded by the elite of Rio' s samba.
The VlPs of Mangueira Samba School heard two celeb' s speeches.
Pelé succeeded in making Bill Clinton... the first US president to join Mangueira.
Look here!
Be quiet!
I can do that too.
I' il make you a deal:
Don' t eat my sneakers and I won' t eat you.
Okay?
What' s up?
What' s up?
Who' s Bil?
Who' s Bil?
Who' s Bil?
Who' s Bil...
Bil, daddy' s going out now to buy food for you.
Food for Bil.
After I killed Suel a lot of things changed in my life.
That was all the neighborhood talked about.
They were proud of me.
I always thought life sucked, I always did everything wrong... but now it was different.
I started to enjoy things.
I felt important, happy.
I was going to get a job, work, and date.
In Japan there are many ways to prepare fish... but only a way to cut it.
Ginsu 200O for the legend lives on.
Sharper than ever, its carbon steel blade... cuts bones like this.
A genuine Ginsu can cut, carve, chop, saw and slice.
Its extremely sharp saw- toothed edge can easily carve... this turkey and this shank.
Ginsu cuts any kind of vegetable.
Look.
How much would you pay for this Ginsu 200O?
Don' t answer yet because you' il also receive 6 other knives for barbecue.
Their double saw- toothed blades can carve any kind of meat.
That' s not all.
You' il also get this cutter... for delicate cuts of meat that won' t require further sharpening.
Bil!
Listen to me!
You' re not doing your part!
Hi.
Hi.
Folks are talking about you.
Jesus, what happened to your sneaker?
- Oh, that was Bil.
- The dog?
- No, the pig.
- Pig?
You' ve got a pig now?
- Cool, where is it?
- It' s in the bathroom.
A piglet... to eat.
What do you think I' d have a pig in the house for?
Oh, don' t eat it.
Pigs are so cute.
What is it?
Toothache.
- Feel better?
- Sure.
- Do you like pork?
- Sure, nice piece of loin.
You know, I prefer you like this, blond.
Suits you.
You' il have to go back and redo the roots.
I think you' d better go and find a dentist.
DENTAL SURGEON
I hate Rio.
Violence is turning this city into a jungle.
Crime is running rings around this place, son.
I' m in favor of the death penalty.
All that talk about human rights is a laugh.
They' re not humans, kidnappers, rapists.
If you ask me, one' s born with criminal impulses.
Dr. Carvalho was a strange man, but I liked him.
He told me some funny things.
But I was ashamed to open my mouth, my teeth all fucked up.
Your teeth are decayed, son, all of them.
How much to pull out the one that' s hurting?
I can treat your teeth.
You' re too young for dentures.
I don' t think I' ve got enough to pay for treatment.
You' re the one who killed Suel, aren' t you?
You don' t need to pay, son.
I like you.
That is, I like what you did to Suel.
That mulatto had it coming to him.
I hate blacks.
I hate mulattos.
I' m one helluva racist.
Everyone' s racist.
Only the hypocrites have no courage to admit it.
I' il tell you something:
You' ve got a problem.
I' m a dentist and I' ve got a problem.
We can help each other.
You do me a favor and I' il do you a favor.
How about it?
This is my daughter.
She' s 17, just a kid.
She was raped.
I never told the police.
You know, the humiliation.
Máiquel, I want you to kill the bastard who hurt my girl.
I' ve nowhere to stay.
I' il come live at your place.
Here?
Suel looked after me... now you' il have to.
It' s no use throwing me out.
I won' t go.
How old are you?
Fifteen.
If you won' t let me in, I' il stay right here outside your door.
And every time you go out, I' il sneak in.
Suel' s mother threw me out.
I' ve got nowhere to go.
You' il have to keep me now.
Give me a place to stay, food, clothes... everything I need.
To get rid of me you' il have to kill me, like you did Suel.
I' m not leaving, period.
Gee, I' ve already got one pig in there.
It' s nice here.
You can stay here till we find someplace else.
You can sleep on the bed.
I' il take the sofa.
I don' t know about a criminal' s soul... but an honest man' s soul is a living hell.
Just take a look around.
Walls with broken glass, iron barbs, barbed wire, bulletproof cars... bulletproof windows...
All we ever think about is defending ourselves.
No one respects traffic lights anymore.
No one goes out at night.
No one opens their window at night.
We' re all scared stiff.
Well, I fulfilled my promise.
Have you brought me any news?
I know where he works, at a pet store.
He lives with his mother.
She' s really sick... but he takes good care of her.
Everyone' s got a mother, son.
Even Emperor Nero had a mother.
Just look at your new smile.
Smile, son, show your teeth, laugh.
I' m the one who can no longer smile.
This pain consuming me, my poor baby girl.
I need money to buy a new gun.
- Why did you kill Suel?
- Get out!
- I' m not looking.
- Get out and close the door!
Why did you kill Suel?
He didn' t do anything to you.
You can stay at my place, eat my food... wear my clothes, ask for money, play with my pig... sleep in my bed, just don' t annoy me with that question!
- Who are you looking for?
- Caju.
This is an AR- 15, been very popular here in Rio for a long time... good for pumping lead.
The ammo' s a bitch to find, though.
Uzi... handles easy.
I like this babe a lot.
Real nice.
12 Pump pistol.
No, I want something lighter, I don' t know, a revolver.
- A 38.
- I know what you want.
You want something light... to carry hidden in your belt, to command a little respect.
Right?
Take a 45, semi- automatic.
Knocks them right out.
And the ammo' s readily available.
Here.
Feel it.
Feel that power.
Feels like you' re wearing a crown, right?
Tell me.
You' re Máiquel, aren' t you?
What' s up, man?
Oh, nothing.
In those days, I hadn' t yet learned to hate.
People said Ezequiel was evil... but all I could see was this poor bastard.
Hi.
Hi.
Weren' t you gonna introduce me your friend who' s staying at your place?
She' s an acquaintance.
I' m going to take a shower.
Wait, I' ve got something important to tell you.
- What' s that on your shirt?
- Nothing.
I cut myself.
He' s angry at me.
But I already told him I' m not leaving.
Promise she' s leaving?
I promise.
Haven' t you noticed anything different?
Take a good look.
I' ve put over 6 pounds, can' t you tell?
Guess.
I' m pregnant.
We can marry in March, the baby' il be born in November.
So I can take my vacation from work.
You know the priest I told you about?
I love Father Oscar.
At the church Our Lady of Conception... they do weddings with 15, 20 couples.
It' s the loveliest thing in the world.
Or maybe we should just get married by ourselves.
Or everyone will be comparing dresses.
Come on, say something!
I thought we could go and live with my mom.
I don' t really like this place.
We can do up that room at the back.
But tell me... don' t I look pregnant?
- A church wedding?
- Yeah.
With a wedding dress, veil, garland, the works?
How am I meant to know?
Are you mad at me or at yourself about getting married?
I want to marry.
I like Cledir.
I asked her to marry me.
Tomorrow I' m going to her place to make the arrangements.
I want to change, want to be a normal man... have a family, kids, go to church on Sundays...
Don' t be ridiculous, Máiquel!
And where would you get the money to take care of us?
You have no job.
You know we' re an unauthorized dealer.
You want in?
Fine, but that' s the deal.
No, Marcão, that' s not my scene now.
I need a proper job.
I' m getting married.
Going to have a kid.
Why get married right now?
Go and tell her:
Look, I' ve no job, no money.
Make a deal with her.
You don' t know what' s like to have a son.
Tell her:
- Let' s get rid of the baby together.
- I want to get married, work.
If you ask me, only dumb women get pregnant.
And they should pay the price on their own.
Let her bring up the brat.
Maybe it' s not even yours.
Bitches fuck around...
Not bitch, man!
Cledir, there' s something I want to talk about.
- Look how it' s growing, so big now.
- It sure has grown.
Mom' s coming, she' s getting dressed.
Let' s just talk about the wedding, no need to mention I' m pregnant, OK?
Your hands are freezing.
Are you nervous?
Cledir, I' ve been thinking...
I' ve be thinking, and I think it' s for the best...
Ready!
I' m coming!
Ah, Máiquel, I' m so pleased to receive you in my home!
Sit down, son.
Now I can call you son, right?
We must register this occasion!
It' s so nice to see you together.
Praise the Lord!
Máiquel' s Coke!
I' il just fetch it.
- No ice, mom.
He likes it without it.
- You told me so many times, I forgot.
I wanted to tell you...
See how happy she is?
She loves you.
I' ve got to tell you something, Cledir.
I know this is a special occasion for you...
Go on!
I think the time' s not right yet...
Cheers!
Cheers!
I' m going to recite a poem!
Quiet!
Life is an open air tunnel.
Love...
Oh, I' m no good at poetry.
When I think of Cledir I imagine a world of four letters:
Love.
What about the honeymoon?
We' re going to Araruama.
Anyone been there?
No.
No money...
Humberto!
This is Marcão, and that' s my cousin Robinson.
- So you need a job?
- Yes.
The guy who used to work with me disappeared.
Completely.
Do you like animals?
- Sure.
Animals?
- Then the job' s yours.
Máiquel, come and cut the cake!
Cledir was so beautiful that day.
And I realized I wanted to be a normal man.
A working man, married... with children.
That' s what I wanted, to be a regular guy like everybody else.
I was going to work at the pet shop.
Everything would be fine.
Lots of shit, right?
Only thing these animals know what to do is shit.
Might as well get used to it, you' il have to clean up plenty of baby shit.
That' s what marriage is:
Baby shit.
And baby shit is like quicksand:
Take one step and the shit won' t let go of you.
- Not all marriages are the same.
- They are.
Only the shit changes.
There' s porous shit, runny shit...
Women are only cute until their wedding day.
After that, they turn into fat, vindictive cows.
They never forgive you for having married them!
Do you have any dog biscuits?
- What brand?
- Any.
The most expensive.
So this is where you' re working, son?
Do you earn enough to keep your family?
You did a good, clean job, kid.
Brilliant future ahead of you.
Dr. Carvalho, could we talk outside?
You went off before I could fully show... all my gratitude, son.
Not many people you can rely on these days.
What' s wrong?
Regrets?
Regret becoming a hero?
Of having rid society of a monster?
Here, this is for you.
See you around.
- That guy is a friend of yours?
- He' s my dentist.
What a jerk.
See, Zilmar?
From here I can see all the entrances to the house.
A monitor for each camera.
I know who enters, who leaves.
It' s great.
Sometimes I sit here with my whisky.
See, Sílvio?
I drink my whisky and sit waiting... for the day when someone comes.
Hang on, Carvalho.
You really think that shit might work?
Soares had bulletproof car, bulletproof door... and look what happened to him.
Like I said, a guy puts a gun to your head and what happens?
You shit yourself.
Then you open the door, the safe, the works.
If a criminal wants to get into your house, he will do it.
And he' il take your car, your dollars, your gold, the works!
Only one way to deal with it.
Look, there' s our guest now.
We' ve got to be realistic.
The cops are incompetent, corrupt.
- Can' t expect a damn thing from them.
- Sure, Carvalho!
You think I' m expecting something from the cops?
Me?
Remember that crazed nigger in that bus?
The entire police force against a street kid?
Remember what the kid shouted?
I' m the devil' s son!
Hi.
Honey, your father is talking business with his friends.
Go back to your room.
Go ahead, Sílvio, speak to the man!
Máiquel, Carvalho told me about how you' ve been helpful... about your credentials in the community, how reliable you are... that you' re ready for anything.
Just this month I' ve been mugged twice.
By a guy called Neno.
The guy is making... my family' s life hell, and my businesses too.
The police don' t lift a finger 'cause they' re scared of the press... who are afraid of the NGOs.
Fucking priests talk about human rights... protecting 14, 15 year- old pickpockets.
We must defend ourselves.
I want you to kill this criminal for me.
- Kill him?
- Sure, kill him.
How much do you want to get rid of this guy?
His name is Neno.
Go on, son, ask away.
Sílvio will give you as much as you like.
Like it?
I came for Bil.
I convinced Cledir to let him stay there.
Here.
- Got an old blanket?
- What for?
For Bil.
For the pig?!
Like pigs feel the cold, Máiquel!
Really!
How do you know pigs don' t feel the cold?
How do you know pigs don' t feel the cold?
For Heaven' s sake!
Women are only interested in us to get married and have kids.
Then they spend the rest of their life getting on our nerves.
Getting fatter and fatter.
I don' t know what' s worse, the ones who put on weight... or those who work out and stay too thin.
I' ve got this theory:
Women work out to stay sexy for their lovers.
If you ever find your wife working out in the gym... beat the shit out of her because she must be cheating on you.
Today' s your birthday.
Pick a dog as a present.
I' il take this one.
His name is Pickpocket.
I' ve given them all names.
Pickpocket steals everyone else' s food.
But I think it' s better if I take him later.
Bil might not like him.
- Shall we serve dinner?
I' m starving.
- Did you turn off the stove?
Yes.
Máiquel, they' re not coming.
The baby' s hungry, honey.
Come on, right when things are livening up?
We' re going to...
Easy, easy.
My name is Robinson.
This here is my friend Enoque.
Aunt Rosa, you can serve now!
Let' s sit down, everyone.
Let' s eat.
It' s ready.
Been in the oven for 4 hours.
- It must be delicious.
- What' s this, Cledir?
Why?
Where is...
Bil?
We have a birthday party to go to.
You must be looking for someone else.
Bil!
Bil!
Bil!
How could you do this to me, Cledir?
I was gonna save him for Christmas, but, well, it' s your birthday.
- You killed Bil!
- He messed up the house!
Only the backyard and I always cleaned it up!
I know who you are, Robinson.
I' m looking for your friend.
Máiquel.
But you' il do.
I' il never forgive you for this!
I meant no harm.
I was only trying to please you.
There...
Robinson' s dead.
We were coming here, Neno and the black guy...
Pereba.
Robinson knew right away, man.
He said:
'Easy, Enoque, it' s a setup.' He was right.
He said:
'We' re just going to a party.' Deaf ears.
The guy went round the car and said:
'You' ve had it, I' m loaded.' Bang!
Two shots.
They took out Robinson!
Point blank, right beside me, man.
They sent you a message, Máiquel.
Tell that peroxide fag not to mess with Neno.
Or I' il blow his brains out, too.
Enoque, give me some of that shit.
You sure?
This stuff isn' t doing anything for me.
Nothing.
Enoque!
Give me that shit.
C' mon.
Another.
This shit is useless.
I' m going out.
Bastard sons of bitches!
Enoque, give me another.
Another one.
Izilda, where did you put the cigarettes?
All right?
- Easy.
- Remember me, you son of a bitch?
He can' t see you.
- Here, look!
- What the fuck, man?
Shit, you killed her, Enoque!
- Sorry, I didn' t mean to.
- Fuck.
Sílvio had asked me to kill Neno.
I refused.
That' d been my mistake.
I had to kill that guy.
Either kill, or be killed.
It was better to kill.
Every morning I' d give him a banana.
Bil was very intelligent.
How do they kill pigs?
I don' t know.
I hope Bil didn' t suffer.
I' m sad about Robinson, too.
But Bil kept us company, didn' t he?
No one' s gonna kill you.
I won' t let them.
- Where have you been all night?
- I told you.
I waited up all night for you!
You could' ve phoned!
You didn' t come home because of that pig.
Bil was a pig.
Like chicken...... they' re there to be eaten.
- Give me a break, Cledir!
Don' t talk to me like that.
I roasted the pig because it was your birthday.
I didn' t know you liked it that much.
I do everything for you, and you treat me like a dog.
- Then he treats you fine!
- If you don' t mind!
I' ve got a meeting, Humberto.
Give me some time, Cledir!
Time?
You' ve got time to go off with those sluts!
Máiquel?!
Kamikaze.
Kami means' wind 'and kaze means' divine '.
Divine wind.
The hurricane that destroyed the Mongol fleet... which was going to invade Japan got that name, Kamikaze.
The divine wind saved Japan from the Mongols.
On war against the Americans, the Japanese suicides...
I saw that movie.
Kamikazes and Japanese got screwed and Americans won the war.
Máiquel, stop giving the kid those almanacs.
And now she wants to learn English.
What are you learning English for?
You hardly speak Portuguese.
So I don' t speak Portuguese?
Ask me something.
Ask what?
I don' t know it myself.
Whatever, ask me the synonym of any word.
'Symonym?'
What the fuck' s that?
I' il tell you.
For example:
'Dumb'.
Synonym, 'Marcão'.
He' s leaving tomorrow.
- Erica, go and have a Coke, go on.
- What are you talking about?
- Why can' t I hear?
- Kamikaze stuff.
- Go.
- Shit.
It' il have to be tonight at the funk rave.
Funk rave?
Shit, I hate funk raves.
Out, girls.
Look at the size of that guy' s arm, man!
He couldn' t lift a finger for anyone, son of a bitch.
Spends all day at the gym, working out, damn playboy.
Taking vitamins.
That' s something fags do.
He' s a real gum fag.
Hey, are you a man?
Let me see, here.
Here, take a hit, go on.
Go on, there.
That' s it, you like a nice snort, right?
Hey man, this stuff is taking effect...
I feel like taking a dump.
That' s right.
I' il take a shit and you can eat it!
Ever since I was kid I' ve wanted to make someone eat my shit, see?
And you' re the one who' s gonna eat my shit.
Galego, pull over.
Whose idea was it to bring this guy along?
- Enoque couldn' t make it.
- Not 'guy', friend.
I' ve got a name.
Look here, Zé Galinha.
We didn' t bring anyone along to eat shit.
You can' t do that to someone.
If I want him to eat my shit, he' il eat my shit, okay?
And a jerk like you won' t stop him eating my...
Thanks, man.
MAN SHOT TO DEATH IS FOUND
SHOOTlNG AND DEATH IN RAMOS
MORE VlCTlMS OF VlOLENCE
Here' s the son of a bitch!
Nice album, kid.
Congratulations.
Hygienic work.
Hygienic and patriotic.
That' s how you build a decent nation.
Where' s the bathroom?
End of the corridor, son, on your left.
You?
I was looking for the bathroom.
My father won' t like this one bit.
In fact, he' il think it was on purpose.
He needn' t know, though, right?
In fact, he needn' t find out about what happened here.
I need to go back to the living room.
You know where the bathroom is?
I' m not sure I' m going to let you go.
Don' t do this to me.
Don' t you want to fuck me?
I' ve got to get back.
My wife was away...
I was watching TV in the bedroom when I heard a noise downstairs.
So I went down to see.
Found this black guy... in the living room with a gun.
He was nervous...
I even said:
'You can take anything you want.
I' m alone.
Take all you want. 'So he told me to sit on the sofa.
I asked whether I could have a whisky and he said he' d have one too.
I gave him one.
He sat down beside me... told me his nickname was Pedrão, that his wife was pregnant... that he hated stealing but he was fucked... one of those bastards we' ve seen a million times.
Get to the point, Zilmar, come on.
Hello?
What?
I' il be right there.
My daughter' s just been born.
- Let' s have a little whisky.
- Let' s celebrate, that' s wonderful.
I didn' t die because I managed to drag myself to the gate... where a neighbor found me, all fucked up, on the sidewalk.
So that' s your little job:
Pedrão.
Kneel down.
I didn' t know, but Jesus had scheduled a meeting with me.
I' m going to give myself up to him body and soul, in church.
Keep your daughter and your wife.
- Yes?
- Is Erica in?
'Better the sadness of a smile than the sadness.'
Erica, let' s go.
Have you met Minister Marlênio?
- Pleasure.
Marlênio.
- Pleasure.
- Let' s go.
- I' m reading the Bible with him.
Nothing is more important than the words of Jesus.
Jesus said:
'Now I' ve finally come upon you for I' il send my wrath...'
I need to talk to you.
We can read the Bible tomorrow, Erica, no problem.
I don' t want anything to do with you.
I was 12 when I saw my father die... and decided no one would make me suffer again.
You killed Suel... and that didn' t throw me, I didn' t go to the cops.
I asked you to look after me, and you did.
You married and I didn' t kill myself.
You had a daughter... started getting rich, going around with big shots and leaving me alone.
That hurt, you leaving me alone.
But Marlênio taught me that God is always near us.
And whoever has Jesus in his heart doesn' t need anyone else.
That stupid fucking preacher' s filling your head with bullshit.
I love you, Erica.
Prove it.
What do you want me to do?
Cut my arm off?
Cut my left leg off?
You want me to cut my cock off?
Do you?
No way you' d do it.
You do nothing for me.
I' il do anything you say, anything at all.
I want Cledir to disappear from our lives.
Welcome to the Lord' s Realm.
The door might look narrow, but Jesus' s heart is very wide.
It' s so wide and friendly that has room for the saint and the sinner.
Inside of it there' s room for me, you, everybody.
Those away from Jesus are the ones who should fear.
That' s because they walk hand in hand with the devil.
And God sees all.
God knows all.
And punishes everyone most terribly for crimes committed.
Think about it, brothers and sisters.
Let' s be in peace with our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
Hallelujah.
PEDRO DAMACENO SHOT TO DEATH
Where have you been lately?
I never see you at home.
I' m working at the Church of the Almighty Heart of Jesus.
I' ve come to return your key.
I' m moving there.
Where did you say you' re living?
At the Church of the Almighty Heart of Jesus.
Marlênio arranged it.
You know where it is.
- Who' s Marlênio?
- What are you doing there?
That' s none of your business.
Who' s Marlênio?
- Right, that' s none of your business.
- Who' s this Marlênio?
My minister.
I clean the church, wash, cook, fill in and stamp the cards...
- What cards?
- The congregation' s cards.
Let her live at the church, do whatever she likes.
It' s about time she disappeared from our lives.
Why can' t she stay here?
What has she done wrong?
Listen here, I' m not stupid!
Erica, I never want to see you again.
Get out of my man' s life, you hear?
Scram!
Go on!
Are you having an affair with her?
- You been fucking that kid?
- No, Cledir.
Yes!
You' ve been fucking the kid!
How could you do this to me?!
Come back here, open the door!
Scumbag, open the door!
Scumbag, open the door!
Open this door!
Open this door, scumbag!
'Be ye therefore be wise as serpents... and harmless as doves.'
- Erica, I need to talk to you.
- Can' t you see I' m busy?
Marlênio told me I' m to become his assistant.
I don' t want to meet your son.
Go away!
It' s a girl.
Samanta.
You alone?
I need to talk to you.
God sees all, knows all... and will punish us most terribly for crimes committed.
My weary heart I give to you, Jesus.
I give my life to God because His son gave his for my sake.
Just look at her face.
So unhappy...
Is she going to sleep in our bed with us?
Are you Máiquel?
- Yeah.
- Inspector Santana, 45th Precinct.
- Going out?
- Yeah, got a few things to do.
Is this your car?
Only good thing about this car is... its trunk.
Had one once.
Give me a ride?
Dr. Carvalho gave me your address.
I' ve been following your work.
I' ve got a...
In the trunk there' s a...
The folks in the neighborhood are all on your side and you know it.
The shopkeepers respect you.
I' ve a proposition to make.
Santana offered me partnership... in a private security company.
Everyone needs security.
The small shopkeepers, big businessmen... factories, millionaires.
He' d set up a company... with employees, accountant, lawyer, the works.
Only my name can' t appear.
My name is right out, okay?
What' s up, something bothering you?
My wife, Cledir.
She' s disappeared from home.
What do you mean, disappeared?
Disappeared.
This is your office.
Like it?
It' s not very big, but you don' t need more... than this right now.
The objective here is security for the neighborhood.
That is, for the shops, for those with money, right, son?
Sure.
Santana told me...
Santana doesn' t exist here.
Eleonor just looks after the front end.
One other thing.
You should wear a suit, a decent shirt.
Get some respect, son.
Our company takes care of...
Our organization... provides services to over 30 companies.
Here' s... a list.
Do call and check, if you like.
I' ve got my own setup here.
I work with specialized people... first class pros.
I' ve got everything I need.
Sorry, but we don' t need that sort of service at Átila.
Thanks for your time.
Here' s my phone.
If you need anything, we' re at your service.
Hit the deck, man, get down!
Get down, son of a bitch!
Get your face down, or I' il blow your brains out.
Kneel down.
C' mon, man.
Don' t shoot me.
I know I fucked up but I won' t anymore.
Do you know Átila transportation company?
Sure, they' re up on Gamboa.
Till you kill your first guy, you think you have to learn how to kill.
Learning to kill is like learning to die.
One day you die, and that' s that.
If you' re holding a gun, that' s it, you know all there is to know.
Suspicious about what?
Érica, Cledir' s aunt can go to hell.
How could she be suspicious?
Get out!
Go and buy anything you like!
You think I would buy a screen that size?
How many inches is it?
You call this a home theater, damn it?
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
We' re gathered here to listen... to the words of our Man of the Year... elected by the neighborhood.
Mr. Máiquel Jorge!
I' m deeply moved by this honor.
It is the duty of all of us to fight ceaselessly so that... those who wish to live in peace traders, workers... neighbors, fathers, mothers and families... may enjoy a most necessary tranquility and safety.
- If I ever did anything for you...
- Where were you?... it was no more than my duty.
I shall not rest, I promise.
Thank you.
You know what' s in this bag?
Cledir' s clothes.
I told you to throw that out, Erica.
I can' t.
I was going to the other day... only I found this top, look.
You don' t speak English.
You don' t know what it means.
Hello?
Hi, Galego.
Easy, man.
Speak slowly.
Wait, Galego.
- Érica!
- Just a minute.
Come here!
- What' s he doing in here?
- I invited him for a coffee.
Galego, I' il be right over.
I don' t like that guy.
What' s he doing in here?
Poor thing, Máiquel.
The church needs money.
Are you going to give him money?
You said you were earning a shitload of money, for me to ask for anything.
Well, I want to give money to the church.
I can' t believe you can' t handle this on your own!
I manage this shit now!
I don' t work the streets anymore.
Where are they?
Don' t know.
Enoque' s vanished.
Marcão hasn' t shown up for 2 days.
This job needs more people anyway.
Hello.
Holy shit!
Aren' t you a police chief?
Can' t deal with this?
He knows everything, but won' t open his mouth.
Find a way for me to have a word with him, all right?
Marcão' s been arrested with 2 pounds of coke.
What the fuck' s going on?
Five minutes, okay?
Someone put the finger on me.
Someone wants to fuck me.
- Who?
- Someone who' s jealous.
I' m on top, got a brand new car, dress well.
Some people can' t stand seeing a black guy go up in the world.
- Two pounds of coke?
- It' s all lost, Máiquel.
Find a way to get me out of here.
Talk to Santana.
The Drug Squad... went looking for drugs buried in Marcão' s yard, and found a body.
I can' t believe you guys fucked up like this.
I can smell shit.
No problem, as long as Marcão doesn' t talk, it' il be all right.
You don' t understand.
There' s smell of shit.
You must' ve trod in shit.
Holy shit, that nigger sure is dumb.
He' s dumb but you' re going to get him out of there.
I can' t do a thing.
I' ve told you a thousand times.
- He was nabbed in other jurisdiction.
- Jurisdiction, what the fuck?
- Are you a police chief or not?
- Easy, man.
There' s a little matter called the law.
Honest cops do exist.
Even if I wanted to, I couldn' t release an idiot... who buried a body in his backyard.
It wasn' t Marcão.
I know Marcão.
It wasn' t him.
So who was it?
Whose body is it?
I dreamed about Christ last night.
He rang the bell.
I opened the door, He came in and said:
'Erica, you and Máiquel must turn yourselves in to the police.'
Jesus always wants people to turn themselves in.
Want anything?
Chocolate milk.
Don' t you think I look like Him?
Take a look.
Amazing.
The spitting image.
Máiquel, there' s something I have to tell you.
I told Marlênio that we killed Cledir.
It' s faith that extinguishes the fire of hell!
It' s faith that cleanses your soul!
Faith that purifies your body!
It is faith that saves us!
Please all rise.
Let us join hands.
And now, hand in hand...
I' d like a prayer of faith.
Faith... in our Lord Jesus.
Erica' s not feeling well.
She asked me to fetch you.
Priests can' t go around telling what they heard in confession.
I' m not a Catholic priest.
I' m a pastor.
Erica promised me you' d turn yourselves in to the police.
I gave her two days.
If you confess everything, show repentance for your crimes... you shall be saved from the fires of hell.
God did not mean us to be hateful and angry.
Get out.
If God thinks I should do more, I' il come back and kill you.
- What happened to your hand?
- Nothing.
- I' il call the pharmacist.
- Don' t bother, Gonzaga.
I' d been robbed over 10 times.
I was even shot.
But since I joined Sesepa, they left me in peace.
I can even stay open all night, they don' t dare to do a thing.
I' d like to thank you, Mr. Máiquel.
Thank you very much.
There' s something I wanted to say to you.
You set curfew in the neighborhood at 10 p. m.
That' s not good, the night schools have to send students home earlier.
I' il lift the curfew tonight.
Let everyone know.
What about the park lawn?
You could free the park lawn...... for the kids to play ball.
- I forbad kids to play on the lawn?
Yes.
Someone said they were damaging the lawn, so you put a stop to it.
No, no.
I said grown- ups couldn' t play there.
Children can, children up to about 10, 11.
You know I like kids.
My name is Paulo Mendes.
Carvalho gave me your number.
I have a company here in Nilópolis.
And I' d like to meet you at Sesepa.
I' ve got quite a bit of trouble and...
I need to talk to you about our friend.
Meet me at the club at 10 p. m., okay?
Listen, Máiquel.
Marcão was going to squeal.
He was saying that... he' d drag plenty down with him.
Meaning you and me, damn it.
You' ve a glorious future ahead of you.
That traitor of a nigger was going to destroy you!
Have you had Marcão killed, Santana?
What else could I have done, man?
I can' t believe this.
First Robinson, now Marcão.
You' ve got to get out of this world.
Let' s confess everything and escape the fires of hell.
I' ve been in hell for ages.
Yes?
My name' s Max.
I' m a police detective.
May I come in?
This is Erica, my sister.
She' s a bit upset.
Right, Erica?
With my sister...
I mean, my wife disappearing.
She... disappeared, left me.
That' s what I' d like to talk to you about.
- Have you found Cledir?
- I' il do the talking!
How long has your wife been missing?
A month, more or less.
Do you recognize this bracelet?
It' s my wife' s.
Where did you find it?
It was found on a corpse we found buried... in the backyard of the drug dealer Marcos de Sousa, known as Marcão.
We think it might be your wife.
Cledir dead?
She' s dead?
You found her body?
Let me see that again.
- May I keep it?
- No.
What' s wrong, Erica?
Are you scared of that cop?
- No one can prove a thing!
- I' m scared of you, Máiquel.
You' ve changed.
You liked going out with me.
You had fun, used to laugh...
Now everything stinks!
You never sit down, never turn your back, never sleep!
I do everything for you, Erica.
I love you.
Hear me quick, Lord!
I deserved to be punished.
Forgive me, Lord.
I don' t want to sin no more.
Hear my prayer, let my claims get to You.
Do not hide Your face from me... on the day of my anguish, lean Your ears to me on the day that I call.
I deserved to be punished, forgive me.
I don' t want to sin no more.
You know you' ve fucked up, don' t you?
So you kill your wife, and bury her...
I didn' t mean to.
When I pushed Cledir, she banged her head...
It' s no use.
You won' t be able to explain it.
The situation' s fucked up.
We came to offer you a scheme, something good for you.
I' m not going to jail, and I' m not dying.
Listen to our plan, damn it!
You' il be arrested anyway.
So it' d better be by Santana.
After a while you' il no longer be news.
Things cool off, people forget.
Remember the guy who killed parents, brother, grandma, the whole family?
No one remembers him anymore.
Before long some guy who rapes young girls will come along... and take your place in the headlines.
I' il arrange rigged witnesses and put in the report... that the whole thing was a setup by a criminal friend of yours.
No one will be able to prove a damn thing against you.
And you won' t even stay in jail for long 'cause our lawyer... is asking the judge to relax your sentence, got it?
- I won' t be arrested, damn it!
- Máiquel, look at me.
It was Marcão who killed Cledir, okay?
Everything' s cool, man.
- So you don' t want to be arrested?
- No.
Fine.
So you' il have to spend some time at Carvalho' s place, in Angra.
- Damn it, Angra?
- That' s right.
I' m arranging it with Santana.
Take some time off, get a tan.
- Everything will be all right.
- That bastard' il be off the hook... with your arrest.
He' il be a hero and will do you like he did Marcão.
Marcão, Marcão!
He never needed Marcão!
He needs me.
He earns a fortune through Sesepa.
Galego, you never liked Santana.
They want to help me.
- I' m going to Angra.
- Listen...
It' il lose all its clients.
That investigator...
Max, he' s not into money.
He' il get you, the dentist...
Santana...
You' ve got to get out of here, now!
I get tons of letters, people love me.
- No one wants me arrested.
- Anyone important?
The people who count are those with money.
To them you' re pure poison.
I never want to see you again, jerk.
No way.
The pastor found a place for me, a long way away.
You won' t find me.
I took your daughter.
You never gave a damn about her, anyway.
And I took US$ 20, OOO from the safe.
I' m sorry but I had to.
I hope you go fuck yourself and that your life turns to shit.
Till never again.
Máiquel.
I took your daughter.
You never gave a damn about her, anyway.
I' m pregnant.
Never turn your back, never sleep.
I do everything for you, and you treat me like a dog.
Robinson' s dead.
That bastard' il be off the hook with your arrest...
like he did Marcão.
You' ve got a problem.
I' m a dentist.
We can helpeach other.
I want you to kill that bastard.
We can help each other.
I want you to kill that bastard.
Hey, son.
You here?
Sit down.
How about a little whisky?
Life' s so weird.
If you let it, it flows all by itself, like a river.
But you can harness it and make life your horse.
You make what you want out of life.
Each of us chooses his fate.
Horse or river.

To those who loved this world once before and spent time with its friends,

Shion- san!
Look at this!
... kinda gross, isn' t it?
Just hurry it up, yo.
I' m counting on you, Reno.
Alright, yo.
Hey, hey, hey!
Senpai, hurry up!
Senpai!
Who is that?!
Ugh...
Elena!
G- go!
Lifestream...
The flow which governs the life of worlds.
It is the source of all worlds and all of the life on those planets.
The Shinra Company found a way... to take the lifestream and use it as a resource.
Because of that, we were able... to live rich and plentiful lives.
But that wore away at the life of the planet...
There were a lot of people who thought that.
Shinra tried to use force... against those who stood in opposition.
Shinra had a special force who were called Soldier.
They were the ones who long ago... took the one falling from the sky to destroy the world,
There was one among them named Sephiroth... who was an excellent Soldier.
But when he found out that he had been born in a horrifying experiment... he came to hate Shinra.
And then finally came to hate everything.
Shinra and those who stood against them.
Sephiroth, whose hate was so great that he tried to destroy the world...
Those people who tried to stop Sephiroth...
There was sadness in the sheer number of battles.
One who I loved also became part of the Lifestream.
And then one day...
A fated day...
The world' s power itself stopped all of the battles.
The world used the Lifestream as a weapon.
The Lifestream, gushing out over the world... took battles, ambition, and sadness...
It took everything and swallowed it up.
In exchange for that sadness, everything stopped.
These things all happened two years ago.
Let' s go.
OK.
But... the world... seems to have been much, much angrier than anyone believed.
(Geostigma)
Hey, Marlene?
What' s going on?
Please, I ask of you.
Please don' t take Denzel away.
He' s not here anymore~
Cloud...
Where are you...?
Hello, Strife Delivery Service!
We' il deliver anyth...... who is this?
I remember you, yo.
I got a phone call from Reno and them in Healin.
They said it' s a commission.
Cloud... have you been doing OK?
No more messages.
Hey, Kadaj...
Is that big brother' s city?
Yeah.
You think they' il give us a big welcome?
No way.
Don' t cry, Yazoo.
Mother must be with him too, right?
I dunno about that.
Don' t cry, Loz.
Look, it' s big brother.
Where' s Mother?
Big brother' s hiding her, isn' t he?
Did he trick us?!
Mother' s really - there -, isn' t she?
Don' t yell about it.
I don' t wanna talk to you!
Give me the boss.
Hey, it' s me, Barret!
I did it!
O- IL- FlELD!
A huge one, too!
And we' re sticking to plan, so soon I' il be able to come visit Marlene!
See ya!
There was another phone call from Reno.
Anyway, just hurry, he says.
He seemed a little weird, though...
Be careful.
Just as I expected, yo!
Rude, you' re so cool!
Just as expected, would- be ex- Soldier.
Your skills are as impressive as ever.
Is that you, Rufus?
You' ve got no luck either...
That day, I...
Just before the buildings crumbled...
Say something.
I' m leaving.
... lend us your power.
Not interested.
We at Shinra have a big debt to repay to the world.
The responsibility of putting the world in its current, pathetic state...
There' s no helping people saying that it falls to us.
Consequently, we must somehow repay this debt of ours.
Let me in!
As our first step...
We began an investigation into the influences that Sephiroth left.
The Northern Crater, yo.
What do you think was there?
Nothing.
There was nothing.
You don' t have to worry about it.
But something unexpected happened.
Someone tried to get in our way.
They' re Kadaj' s gang.
Kadaj...
It seems that they meant to interfere with our plans.
Really...
I can' t figure why.
Why did they attack me?
You' re with us, right?
Kadaj' s gang is young and brutal.
They' re extremely dangerous.
So, we decided to try and hire a skilled bodyguard.
I' m a delivery man.
You' re the only one.
Please, ex- Soldier Cloud.
Would- be...
What is this "Mother" they were talking about?
Kadaj said something, huh?
Well, don' t worry about that.
There are children all over the world who yearn for their mothers.
You' re living with the orphans, I hear.
You don' t want to bring smiles back to their faces?
Our ultimate goal is the rebuilding of this world, Cloud.
I...
Please, Cloud!
We' re rebuilding the Shinra Company, yo!
Not interested.
Reno!
Cloud' s living here?
Looks like it.
What?
Just like Denzel' s!
Is Cloud sick too?
He could just tell us...
Did he leave because he' s sick?
He thinks he' s going to fight them by himself.
Fight?
No...
He doesn' t have the will to fight...
Tifa?
No!
I want to see Cloud!
... I guess you' re right.
It' d be nice to see him, huh?
Yeah!
Hey, what should we do when he gets here?
Go home together!
Before that, we' il lecture him!
Agreed!
I hate lies, you know.
I' m sorry!
This time I' il be honest with you.
While we were running away from you...
It seems that it fell from the helicopter.
What a ridiculous story...
Truly?
I swear it.
Then swear it on these.
What are you after?
We have to have it, for Reunion.
Reunion...
We' re going to collect everyone with Mother' s cells into one place.
And then we' re going to get revenge on the world.
Preparations are coming along pretty well... but you see, someone had to go and hide Mother...
Preparations?
Geostigma.
You know all about it, right, Boss?
In the Lifestream...
All because Mother' s cells are working hard...
And yet we...
We don' t even know where Mother is.
It' s sad but there' s no helping it.
We' re spirits, after all.
We can' t be normal!
Spirits and Geostigma aren' t enough!
Not for the real Reunion, you see.... what are you talking about?
Boss... you' ve figured it out, haven' t you?
I' il live for you as well...
That' s what I decided...
You wanna be a Soldier?
Hey, how do you feel?
Hey, what are you gonna do when we get to Midgard?
We' re friends, right?
Cloud, run!
Wanna play?
I see, you don' t want to.
Where' s mother?
It stinks!
Hey, where' s Mother?
There' s no one here!
Then let' s play.
This should be fun!
Tifa!
It' s not here.
I' m not crying.
Got it.
I' il bring it.
Time to finish this.
Cloud...
Run!
You' ve got Geostigma too, don' t you?
He says he' s gonna cure us.
Tifa?
Tifa!
You' re late...
Who did this?
Someone I didn' t know.
Marlene?!
Dammit!
You were heavy, yo.... you were living with some kids, right?
It' s empty.
That OK?
I...
You' re so annoying, yo.
Brother was hiding it, huh?
The power born from the Lifestream.
These Materia will give us a new power...
Reno and them are searching...
It' s Geostigma... isn' t it?
It' s alright if I die.... is that what you' re thinking?
As I thought.
There' s no cure.
But Denzel was trying his best, wasn' t he?
Why don' t you fight it with us instead of running away?
We could all help each other and try our best!
Can' t do it since we' re not a real family, huh?
I can' t...
I can' t save anyone, I don' t think.
Neither family nor friends...
No one.
Drifting, drifting....
Drifting, drifting!
How long are you gonna drag along like that, yo?
You couldn' t find them?!
There was a witness who saw them being taken away, yo.
Where did they go?
The Forgotten Capital...
Ajit.
I' ve received a special power from Mother.
A power to fight against this planet... which hurts the people living on it.
Actually, you all have this power.
That' s right.
We' re all siblings.
Chosen siblings... who inherited Mother' s cells that were absorbed in the Lifestream.
But...
The planet is trying to interfere.
It' s trying to stunt our growth!
That' s why our bodies hurt and our hearts seem to give up.
I' il cure you.
And we' il all go to Mother together.
We' il bring our family' s power together and get back at the planet!
Follow my lead.
Denzel!
Denzel!!
So you showed up.
Even though you' re falling apart...
I' m sure this will be a good thing.
Question!
Why exactly did you come here?
I... wish to be forgiven.
Yes, I want to be forgiven.
By who~?
So he did show up.
I came for the children.
This guy is our Brother.
But you know, it' s a shame...
He' s a traitor.
Cloud!
You really can' t save anyone, can you?
What' s happening?
I come here a lot.
So I saw Kadaj and them here.
The Geostigma...
It seems that the cause is an overloading of the system to remove parasites in the body.
There' s a flow through the body like the Lifestream...
It fights against the invasion of harmful substances.
Harmful substances...
The Sephiroth element...
Jenova' s cells...
Call it what you want.
You know a lot about it.
Shion and Elena...
They were carried here on the edge of death.
It seemed that they had been put through some hideous torture.
I managed to save them, but...
Well, I' m not sure how well...
Torture?
You reap what you sow.
It seems that they came into possession of Jenova' s head.
And the Mother that Kadaj' s gang is searching for is...
That abominable thing which heaven sent.
Jenova.
If they wanted to, they could even remake Sephiroth.
Kadaj...
What is he?
Hmph, I don' t want to think about it.
Marlene!
Denzel and Tifa, they...!
Tifa is all right.
I want to talk to Tifa!
Do you have it?
I can' t believe it!
Vincent, can you take Marlene back to the store?
I' m going to go talk to Shinra about this.
But...
I don' t care about you anymore, Cloud!
Why won' t you listen to what we' re saying?!
Marlene...
Just wait a little longer...
The fight is going to begin now.
But we can' t just fight!
You understand, right?
I don' t understand!
Cloud, is this really about the fight?
Where did they go?
The Forgotten Capital.
Ajit.
Take care of it.
I' m going to go talk to Rufus.
Don' t run!
I know you are!
Even if you find the children, you might not be able to do anything.
They might be somewhere that we can' t get them back.
You' re scared of that, aren' t you?
But you have to react to now, to more of this!
A burden?
Well there' s no helping that, it' s a heavy burden!
Unless you want to live all alone, you have to deal with that!
You don' t want to be alone, do you?
Even though you never answer, you always have your phone with you.
You go to Ajit, yo.
Have we lost to our memories?
But... we just let her die.
Really, always drifting...
Hey...
Why don' t you forgive yourself?
Can sin be forgiven?
... I' ve never tried it.
Tried it?
Tried it...
Marlene, we' re going home!
I' il try it.
I' il let you know how it turns out.
It' s me, Reeve.
How' s work going?
I just saw you pass by, but can you really make a living doing that?
It is like you, though, Cloud- san.
If it' s OK, I' d like to help, so I' il contact you again.
I got a phone call from Reno in Healin, he says it' s a commission.
It' s Yuffie!
Hey, all the kids from Wutai disappeared...
Do you know anything?
He seemed a little weird, though...
Be careful.
I' ve never thought badly of you.
That' s plenty right there.
Are you listening?
Why are you doing this?!
Denzel!
Denzel!
What are you doing?
Mother' s in there, right?
Why do you say that?
This... what is it?
Shinra' s the one that made it.
Wow, you used your head, didn' t you?
But you' re off- base.
We don' t know either, yo.
What' s this?
You don' t have any faith in us, huh?
Hey, Kadaj.
Tell me one thing.
Just one thing.
You said that you would become normal once you got Jenova' s cells, but...
What did you mean by that?
He... will return.... Sephiroth.
A nightmare, huh?
So I hear.
So you hear?
I don' t know Sephiroth.
Yeah, I just feel him!
It irritates me!
Me or Sephiroth, which does Mother...
Poor spirit...
Whichever it ends up as, you all will meet the same end!
Mother made a long journey to come to this planet.
To erase a bunch of fools from space, you see.
But... you know, don' t you?
Nothing has changed here since the time when Mother came.
That' s why I' m going to make Mother happy.
I' il do anything if Mother commands it.
Hmph, the nightmare comes again, huh?
As long as you guys are here, the same thing will keep happening.
The Lifestream, which governs the flow of worlds...
It comes and goes in the space between life and death...
If that repetition is proof of life...
It is inevitable that history will repeat itself.
I don' t know about Jenova or Sephiroth, but...
The same things should keep happening...
We will obey the fate of life.
And while doing so, we will stop you.
Chief, is that your excuse for seizing Mother?
Are you sure you' re not regretting it?
Regretting?
I' m... beside myself in anticipation.
Good.
Then, shall we go ahead and end this?
Denzel, you have to run!
This is...
It' s no use...
Is it coming?!
I don' t want to look.
Isn' t this fun?
Not at all, yo!
You guys are really stubborn, yo.
I told you, if you just give Mother back, that will be the end of this.
You guys...
What are you planning to do with Jenova' s head?
This Reunion or whatever, are you serious?
We just want so see Mother.
She' s our Mother, but she' s going to decide everything now.
So, where' s Mother?
You know, you keep calling it Mother, but it' s just Jenova' s head.
Hey!
Don' t call Mother that!
I can' t forgive that.
... sorry.
That' s right...
Wait, why are we apologizing?!
Tifa?
You bastard!
Protect your mom here!
Barret!
Huh?
I can' t match this!
Who' s using my materia?!
The bad guys, of course.
Damn them!
Who' s that?
The new version of Sierra!
I' il let you ride it later!
Where' s the phone shop...?
Who' s that person?
They' re all friends.
I dropped her off at the store.
Right.
Huh?
Maybe i wore it down by dragging it along so much.
I' il go back to the store by myself!
I' il be waiting with Marlene.
Cloud, you' il come back too, right?
A little late there!
Isn' t this fun, Boss?
What should I call out next?
Mother?
Figure it out, you who lack filial piety.
Go, Cloud!
There you go!
Fly!
Not done yet!
Here!
Mother!
Boss!
Hey, pal.
Is this thing powerful?
It' s a refinement of Shinra technology.
So you made it...?
I don' t know about powerful, but it sure is flashy.
Oh, really?
You like that, don' t you, pal?
Guess there' s no overtime today, yo?
Mother...
Mother...
Mother!
Let' s go, Cloud.
I was finally able to meet mother!
What' s going to start now?
Mother will tell me.
... the spirits don' t know anything, huh?
I' m just a marionette, after all.
Just like... the old you!
Cloud, I brought you materia!
Don' t shake it!
Hurry and let us down!
Shut up!
Jump!
Let them fight by themselves.
Wha?!
That guy' s a spirit of Sephiroth. ‚ ‚ ¢‚ Â‚ ÍƒZƒtƒBƒ\ x8DƒX‚ ÌŽv” O‘ Ì\ x81E\ x81E\ x81E
You could say he' s kind of like a larva.
Larva?
Bug?
He' s a bug?!
Calm down, Princess.
You' re saying that he' il turn into Sephiroth one day?
Hey, do you think that Cloud knows that?
Probably.
I see...
Let' s leave them alone.
I don' t get it!
Explain!
It' s man' s talk.
Discrimination!
Discrimnaaation~
Calm down, Princess!
Us men don' t understand either!
Two years ago...
That strong feeling that he definitely had during the last battle...
Though it was just two years ago, somewhere along the way, he lost that feeling.
I think that it brought Cloud back to us.
Tsh...
I' il wait 10 minutes.
Cloud sure is a pain, just as always, huh?
He' s honest.
I' il show you my Reunion.
It' s been a while, Cloud.
You lost your Geostigma?
How unfortunate.
Just what are you hoping for?
The spirits of the deceased who carried the Geostigma...
That, with the Lifestream, guides the flow of worlds.
Eventually it infringes on the planet...
What I hope for, Cloud... is to use this world as a ship to sail the darkness of space.
As Mother did before me, you see.
One day we will discover a new world.
We will create our shining future on that ground.
What will happen to this planet?
Who knows... that depends on you, I guess.
Sister?
What made you stronger?
I don' t want to tell you.
I thought of what to give to you as a gift...
Shall I give you despair?
Kneel, and show me your figure, begging for forgiveness.
What is most important to you?
Would you give me the happiness of stealing it from you?
I pity you who understand nothing.
There is nothing that isn' t important!
Stay there for me, trapped in memories.
I...
I won' t become a memory.
Brother...
Kadaj?
Let' s stop working so hard...
Mother?
Let' s go back with everyone, shall we?
OK.
See?
Cloud- san' s a man!
Cloud can do anything if he puts his mind to it!
Hold on tight, you guys!
You were always with us, weren' t you...
Thank you.
Let' s all go home together.
We can all have fun together.
Cloud!
Cloud' s going to come back too, right?
Mother...?
Again!
How many times is it that you called me Mother now? ‰ ½“ x– Ú‚ ©‚ È • ê‚ ³‚ ñ‚ Á‚ ÄŒÄ‚ Î‚ ê‚ ½‚ Ì
Isn' t it nice to be yearned for?
I don' t need a kid as big as this one!
Too bad...
Your place isn' t here, I' m telling you.
Cloud will come here, she said.
Welcome home.
I' m back.
Yeah.
Alright, now we' re getting you cured.
It' s all right now.
Try your best.
Now, everyone jump in!
It' s cured, it' s cured!
You' re all right now, aren' t you?
Yeah.
I' m...
I' m not alone.

- Here you go.
See you tomorrow.
How you doing?
Okay.
- When did the mill close?
- Three years ago this August.
That' s about the closest mill work you' il find.
- It' s just simple economics.
You know, we have a really nice casino, the Wild Cherry.
Want to make some money, maybe you ought to go on down... and try your luck at the blackjack tables.
No, I don' t think so.
Thanks.
You' re Chris Vaughn?
I know all about you, Chris.
I know your folks.
I' m Sheriff Stan Watkins.
- How you doing?
- Ralston, get out of the car!
Pay some respects.
- Welcome home, soldier.
- Thanks.
Well, hell, Chris.
- No, I' m fine.
Thank you.
- I insist.
- I' il walk.
- It' s okay.
I won' t take no for an answer.
Get in the car.
- Did I scare you with that one?
- Little bit.
I scared him.
You were gone a while, huh?
Eight years.
Harstad was sheriff back then.
Aaron Harstad, yeah.
Sad story.
About five months back, he fell asleep at the wheel and hit a tree.
Car folded up like an accordion.
He was a good man.
A good man and a good sheriff.
- Thank you very much for the ride.
- Welcome home, Chris.
It' s election month.
I' m your man.
Say hey to your old man.
Can I help you?
You come over here and give me a hug.
- You look great.
- What is this?
I couldn' t let you be the only one looking good in uniform.
Chris is here.
- Whose tent?
- That' s for Pete.
- Watch out, now.
- Chris.
- Mom, how you doing?
How long' s your leave?
How long do we have you?
For good.
I' m home.
- Really?
You' re not kidding?
- No.
- Hey, Dad.
- Welcome back.
- This is fine, Mom.
- We love Chinese.
- No, this is great.
- So what are you going to do now?
I was planning to work at the mill, but you never mentioned it closed.
We didn' t want to bother you when your father got laid off.
You saw the furniture outside.
And I substitute at the elementary school.
Michelle pitches in... we try to keep things simple.
Pete.
- This is your Uncle Chris.
- Hey, Pete.
Say hello.
Last time he saw you, you were barely walking.
- And now I' m camping.
- I said you could sleep on the couch.
It was Chris' room first.
Your tent' s going to take on water.
I can show you how to rig it.
Doesn' t look like it' s going to rain to me, Colonel.
Eat something.
I worked for a living.
A grunt.
- Did you ever smoke anybody?
- Pete!
Poppa' s still got your gun locked up in the garage.
- Would you teach me how to shoot?
- I figured that' d be scrap metal by now.
I' m still hoping you' il melt that thing down on your own.
- Sorry, Pete.
- I' m out of here, Mom.
- Be back by 10: 00.
- 10: 30.
- 10: 00.
Remind you of anyone?
Okay, it rained.
Happy?
No.
Why don' t you crash on the floor?
You crash on the bed.
Keep you dry.
- Ray- Ray.
- Hello, pudding.
- What' s up, man?
- Good to see you, man.
- How you doing?
- I' m all right.
What is that?
- That' s the Love Machine.
- Girls actually get in there?
- How you been?
- Good.
- Clean living?
You want a beer?
Believe it or not, I quit drinking.
I' d take a soda, though.
Here.
Thanks, man.
Like that?
When you left town... it gave me the idea I should do something with my life, too.
So I went down to Seattle, got a guitar, and became all about music.
And then, pretty soon, I was about music and drugs... and pretty soon I was basically just about drugs... and ended up doing two years for B and E.
I' m sorry.
I' ve been clean and sober 14 months.
Doing construction and renewing those supportive and healthy friendships... from my past.
Matter of fact, I talked to the bastards, told them you were back... and they asked me to politely remind you that it is Saturday.
- As in...
- As in, kick- off' s in 20 minutes.
- You guys still doing it.
We' re still doing it.
- Playing ball?
- Absolutely.
Let' s go, superstar!
- Just like the old days.
When did that happen?
Jay Hamilton Field.
- before he shut it down.
- Why?
Heads up!
Because I opened my casino.
Still got a gun, huh, Jay?
Still got your reflexes.
What?
I' m still all I can be.
- Really?
- I' il just have to see about that.
- What brings you home?
- I just want to relax.
Catch my breath.
- Yeah.
Not today.
I got it.
Come on!
Is that how it' s going to be?
That' s how it is.
- That' s two- hand touch.
Too rough?
Sorry, ladies.
Pick up the outside!
- Fumble!
- That was pretty, wasn' t it?
- What?
- Here, take a walk...
- And knock a long loose?
- First and your last.
- We stop them here, we win, right?
- Right, boys, last play.
- You know how I like winning.
- We need to put this to rest.
- I will take care of Ray.
You stay in and block.
Booth?
Isolate on Vaughn.
- Just give me the ball.
- Go low.
- All right, man.
You got it?
On the first hut.
Break!
Last chance.
- Black- nineteen!
- Watch the outside!
That' s game.
Sorry about that.
Cool, man.
Nice game, ladies.
What the hell was that?
That was a great game, wasn' t it?
Is that the bad one?
- Yeah, it was good.
- Hey, welcome home.
Good to be back.
See you around.
If you' re not doing anything later on, want to come by the casino?
Introduce you to some nice girls.
Drinks are on me.
What do you say?
- Cool.
I' il see you later on.
Good game.
Maybe next time.
Hold up.
Maybe next time I won' t see you in the bleachers, smoking weed.
Welcome home, buddy.
I thought you had to be Native American to own a casino.
- Hamilton' s one- sixteenth Blackfoot now.
- Put it on his application.
And what he slid under the table convinced the powers that be it was true.
- It' s ours for the taking tonight.
- Let' s pick some cherries, boys.
- Here we go.
Just so you guys know, I' m done after I triple my money.
That' s what you said last time.
He had to walk.
Nobody' s going to have any problems finding this place.
It' s the subtle attention to aesthetics that I find most impressive.
Blends in with the mountain so nicely.
- It' s not bad.
A lot of pretty girls.
Let' s gamble.
We' il see you at the Shower Tower, okay?
Isn' t it wonderful?
All your gambling needs under one great, big roof.
You got your ATM machines, tellers to cash your paycheck... and when you' re here, you don' t got to worry about things...
like child support, rent, laws of mathematical probability.
Gentlemen, Mr. Hamilton would like to invite you to the VlP lounge.
- The dream team.
You all healed up?
- Nice place.
Welcome to my world.
Tonight all the drinks are on the house.
If you need a line of credit, say how much.
If you need a little female companionship, done.
- Get inside.
Have a good time.
- Where you going?
I got a few things to do.
Enjoy.
Just remember, nothing in here is free.
- Ray, be nice.
Come on, this place is nothing but fake boobs... and real assholes, if you ask me.
Just water for me.
We got money to win and girls just waiting.
- Here' s to you, Chris.
- Welcome home.
Let' s play, boys.
Go right ahead.
Don' t say we never did nothing for you.
Don' t worry, buddy, everybody' s scared their first time.
- Get in there, Chris.
Okay, just sit back and enjoy it.
- This' il get you started.
- Lf you' re not back by morning... we' il send a search party.
- Have fun.
- Stop drinking.
You from here, or are you just visiting?
A little of both.
I grew up here.
So you' re seeing all the old faces.
You could say that.
Your voice sounds very familiar.
Chris.
Deni.
- Look who' s back.
- So, good surprise?
I told you it was better than gambling.
- Hello.
- Hey, Candi.
Let' s go.
Six, easy six.
Looking for a six to win.
We can do a six.
Can we do a six?
I think I can do a six, right?
Whack it.
Let me have a C- note to put $200 on a bet.
- No.
- Come on.
Hell, no.
Look at them.
- That' s what I' m talking about.
Give me some dice.
Looking for a six.
Give me the dice.
- No, I got it.
Hard six, six.
Looking for a six.
Line in, the dark side wins.
Last come' il get you some.
But I saw it.
- Saw what?
I saw the switch.
This is a clean game, asshole.
Let' s see about that.
Bet you' il roll a seven.
It' s not your roll, sir.
Sir, it' s not your roll.
Will you call security?
Put your bets down on the passline.
- These dice are coming up seven.
- Why don' t we just let it go?
We' re going to let it ride, Jimmy.
The dice are coming up seven.
- It' s not your roll, sir.
- What a surprise.
- No, folks.
No payouts.
- Calm down.
Just take care of that bet, then we' re even.
I would, but it wasn' t a legitimate bet.
- Security.
- It' s not your roll, sir.
- Is there a problem?
- The problem is your dice are loaded.
Does your boss know about this?
Just give me my money.
Come on.
Let' s go.
What now, bitch?
Special Forces.
Wow.
I' il take that.
What are you doing?
Special Forces.
Special treatment.
This guy knows Hamilton.
You just hold him down.
He' s pretty banged up, inside and out.
Whoever did this left him for dead.
A lesser man wouldn' t have survived.
- I need a statement from him, Doctor.
- He' s in no condition to give you one...
- and blood- alcohol level.
- What are you talking about?
I' m just trying to get some facts.
You need to be arresting whoever tried to kill my brother, not testing his blood.
Okay?
But we still don' t know who started all this.
- It wasn' t Chris.
- Just find out who did this to him, Stan.
In the meantime I have to file a full report.
Will you let me know when I can talk to him?
Thank you.
- He' s going to be fine, Michelle.
- Thanks.
- Beautiful flowers.
They' re for my best friend.
So much for our VlP status.
Don' t they teach you any basic fighting skills in the Army?
How did you do?
Not good.
But I tell you, that guy was feeling me this morning.
- You okay?
- That was a hell of a homecoming party.
Chris, I don' t know if you noticed, but this ain' t exactly home anymore.
Hang on.
Come on.
I' m good, Mom.
- No.
I' m just milking it.
There' s some old crutches in the garage.
- Crutches.
That' s nice.
Did you see the hole?
- Mind if I watch TV?
- No, that' s cool.
- Little bit.
You make this?
- Something wrong?
- No, it' s good, man.
It' s good.
Thanks.
- Changed the plugs a while back.
- I appreciate that, Dad.
I might' ve had serious issues with your career choice... but it just didn' t seem fair to take it out on an innocent truck.
Where you headed?
Want to come?
Let' s go.
Your whole life, all you wanted to do was get out of here.
What made you come back now?
You' re going to think I' m crazy.
I would think about the mill.
When I was a kid going to visit you at work, the smell of that fresh- cut cedar...
You remember that smell.
I remember a lot of nice things before the mill closed.
When did they go out of business?
Closed about six months ago.
There' s a Home Depot about 15 minutes up the road.
And that?
Don' t ask.
First of all, I just want to say thanks.
- For what?
- For making that stickman.
He' s been fired and his gaming permit' s been pulled.
I just have no idea why my security cameras didn' t catch that.
They miss a lot in your place, don' t they, Jay?
- Look, Chris, I hate seeing you like this.
- Your boys did it.
Wait a second.
Understandably.
You don' t know what kind of assholes they have to put up with on a daily basis.
Look, they' ve been reprimanded.
But they say you went nuts, man.
I' m sorry.
Insensitive.
I know the proper term that vets use is post- traumatic stress...
- What the fuck you talking about?
You tore my place apart... and it wasn' t easy to get my guys to agree not to press charges.
Chris, if you had a problem, shouldn' t you have come to me?
I want to make you head of security.
- What do you say?
- No.
I figured as much.
It' s a little something to help you get, you know...
Come on, man, don' t be like that.
I came all the way out here to your house, just to see you get back on your feet.
I' m going to the sheriff.
I' m really sorry you feel that way.
I' il see you around, Chris.
I know, it was a good time, wasn' t it?
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Hey, Chris.
You' re looking spiffy.
I' m here to press charges.
This isn' t about that incident at the casino a while back?
It is.
Because that matter' s closed.
I mean...
Did you even look into it?
That' s good enough for me.
An internal investigation?
I know you' re familiar with the term no- fly zone.
Because that' s what the casino is.
Since the mill closed down... that casino is the main source of revenue in this town.
So case closed, basically.
We' il see you.
- I' m not going to let this stand.
- Excuse me?
- What did you say to me?
- I said I' m not going to let this stand.
You' re lucky to be alive right now.
That' s all you need to be concentrating on.
Okay?
I' m the sheriff here.
I' il tell you what will stand.
Not the other way around.
Now please get out of my building.
- Come in.
- Thanks.
This belongs to you.
I thought this was history.
- Could have left it in the trash, but I...
- Nice to see you, dear.
- Hi, Mrs. Vaughn.
Can I talk to you outside for a second?
Quick walk.
Mom, I' il be right back.
- How you been?
- Been better.
Talk to the sheriff yet?
He sure as hell didn' t seem like much of a sheriff.
He' s up for reelection, you know.
- Maybe you could take his job.
- Somebody ought to.
How about you?
Teach you how to cultivate your happiness.
- Go with the flow, that sort of thing.
- Is it working?
I have my moments.
So, the casino, huh?
Been there almost a year.
- Treating you good?
- A lot better than it treated you.
I like that.
Jay Hamilton' s done well for himself, hasn' t he?
He' s a real go- getter, that one.
I heard he got you.
It was a long time ago.
You still work for him, though.
Rent' s got to be paid, Chris.
I suppose so.
- Hope to see you around.
- Do you?
Thanks for the jacket.
And where is he?
It' s okay, Mom.
He' s stabilized.
It was close.
I' m sorry.
It' s true.
We might' ve kind of pushed him into it.
- Where' d you get the drugs?
- I' m not really sure...
Stop.
Where?
From the security guys working at the casino.
Call the police.
It won' t do any good.
- He' il be fine.
What are you doing?
Not like this.
If you go out of here with that gun, they' re going to nail...
I' ve been looking for you.
Guess that changes our relationship a bit, huh?
You should not have come looking for trouble.
Get out of the vehicle now, Chris.
Now!
- Step back, please.
- Just move toward the front of the car.
Put your hands on the hood.
If you go to trial, you stand to do 18 years.
Now, this is a sweetheart plea.
Normally they wouldn' t even put it on the table... but your military record can' t be ignored.
- pretty generous offer, Chris.
- But I' d have to plead guilty.
Look at it from the other side.
There' s over a dozen witnesses, none of whom will paint a flattering picture.
- He started busting up the machines.
- There was a gunshot.
- He just went crazy.
- A complete psychopath.
They' re only offering me this deal just to keep me quiet.
I still say you should take it.
I wasn' t wrong.
And I won' t say I was.
There was no chance of that once he came in.
He' s highly trained, violent.
A very dangerous person.
So violent, so dangerous, so highly trained... that he dispatched six of the casino security staff single- handedly.
Six men, single- handedly.
His weapon of choice, a simple piece of cedar... which, in his hands, became a devastating force with one aim:
He just came in and took over the place.
- You said he broke your arm.
My right forearm.
Both bones with a single shot.
It was crazy.
But nothing with this sort of violence.
Did he give you any kind of advance warning... a chance to defend yourself?
Besides, he seemed to be too busy enjoying himself from what I could see.
So from what you saw, he seemed to have some kind of purpose?
He had a point to prove.
I was emptying machines when he came in and started swinging.
- I was trying to get out of there.
- He was a menace.
- A very dangerous person.
- Military- trained.
He seemed like a complete psychopath.
- Nothing close to this.
- I didn' t know what he' d do.
- I was frightened.
- He came for us.
- No doubt.
I have no further questions.
Mr. Crowe, you may present your client' s case.
You' re fired.
Your Honor, I' d like to plead my own case.
Order!
If you choose to represent yourself, and not be represented by legal counsel... you realize that you can' t then claim a mistrial on that basis?
- Yes, I do.
- Very well, Mr. Vaughn.
I don' t deny anything that was said here today.
Does that mean you' re changing your plea to guilty?
I' m not guilty of anything... except standing up for myself when the law wouldn' t.
He' s trying to introduce prior events.
Sustained.
Mr. Vaughn, stay on point.
I grew up in this town.
They wouldn' t have traded the mill for a crooked casino.
We' re not here to listen to civic speeches...
And they wouldn' t have stood around while drugs were sold to kids.
- Objection!
Mr. Vaughn, you' re close to being held in contempt.
I was justified in what I did.
And if you acquit me of these charges, then I' m gonna run for sheriff.
- Mr. Vaughn.
- And if elected, I' m gonna fix this town.
Order.
Please take your seat.
Mr. Vaughn, you are now charged with contempt.
- Sustained.... never happens to anyone again without punishing those who did it.
I' m ordering the jury to ignore what they' ve just seen.
Mr. Vaughn, take your seat.
Order.
Or you' re all charged with contempt!
Mr. Foreman, has the jury reached a verdict?
We have, Your Honor.
Defendant, please rise.
We find the defendant, Chris Vaughn, not guilty.
This is mine.
You won the election.
But we do have a tradition of professional courtesy up here.
And I can personally vouch for each and every one of these men.
They' re good deputies.
You' re all fired.
- Hey, Chris.
- License and registration, please.
You' re joking, right?
License and registration.
You.
And the drugs you' re peddling out of your casino.
You took care of that.
And I plan on taking care of everything else, too.
If you can, try to think this through:
Why would I jeopardize that by selling drugs?
Because you owned the town, Jay.
That' s changed now.
Really?
But underneath it is the same guy who couldn' t make it playing college football... and apparently couldn' t make it in the Army... and not really ever gonna make it as a cop.
- Is that right?
And if you push too hard, you' re going to be a man who never gets to see 40.
License, please.
Thanks, Sheriff.
It' s your last warning.
What' s wrong with my taillights?
They' re broken.
- Morning, Sheriff.
- Morning, Deputy.
Come on, man.
You know I hate cops.
You' ve been sheriff for about two minutes, and I' m already starting to hate you.
- I' m a convicted felon.
- I' ve got pull around here.
Now you' re a crooked cop doing favors for friends.
That' s how it starts.
- frisking dudes' crotches.
- Are you done?
- Ray, I need your help.
- Don' t do that.
I need you to take me to drug school.
I get to wear a uniform?
The stuff in this town is five- star, factory pure.
- So let' s go get the factory.
- Easier said than done.
We know Hamilton' s boys are selling that shit down at the casino.
So we got to play follow- the- money, starting with the tweakers.
That' il give us the suppliers.
These guys are real edgy, so delicacy is the key.
Then we put the squeeze on them... till they spit out the location of the next buy.
- Where' d you learn that, Ray?
- Cops.
That' s a good show.
We strike.
- I thought you said delicacy was the key.
Delicacy and precision.
- Get out of here.
- You' re sure you' re not carrying anything?
- I don' t have shit.
- Officer.
- Yeah.
Search him.
Spread your legs.
Arms down.
You been working out?
Nothing there.
Somebody needs a bath.
Now you read me my rights, then you take me in... and I call my lawyer.
Okay.
But I have a hunch there may be something else in here.
Could be.
Have a good time.
Handles pretty good.
He' s clean.
Guess we got to go with Plan B.
Screw you both.
I do have a bit of information for you.
There' s a whole lot of people in this one.
Spit it out.
You' re gonna get hurt.
What an idiot.
Why does it always have to be your fight?
- You might need this.
- No.
- Come on.
You' re just being stubborn.
You and me both, boy.
Chris, listen.
You be careful.
I will.
Please step away from the vehicle!
Mr. Booth, are you still upset over that body- cavity search?
I forgot, you got no vehicle.
There is nothing to...
- Sure.
- Over here?
I need you to look after my parents' place.
Think they' re gonna take it that far?
- I' m with you, man.
- Okay.
You making house calls?
- Don' t shoot.
- Hey.
How' s the food around here?
Nice.
I brought you special treats:
Salad, fried chicken... potato salad.
- Do you have glasses?
- Yeah.
- Do you have to work tonight?
- I quit.
I could make a few myself.
- Who is that?
- Want something to eat?
I' m good, man.
I got to get a bigger bed.
No, you don' t.
Do it.
I' m hungry.
We' ve got leftovers.
And bacon.
I told you, Vaughn.
Stay here.
Who needs to step away from the vehicle now, Vaughn?
Truck for a truck, baby!
That' s right!
Truck for a truck!
Get down!
Tear it up, boys!
Pete, something' s burning.
Take this.
Get in there.
Good morning, honey.
Get out of here.
Sheriff, are you home?
I told you someone was going to get hurt!
Come here.
When I say now, start shooting!
Stay low.
Vaughn!
You got to get me out of here.
Move it, old man.
- Where' s Pete?
- I don' t know.
Sit down.
- Oh, yeah?
- Burke?
- Son of a bitch.
Check it out.
Get me out of here, man!
- What' s it worth to you?
- Screw you!
Hamilton' s operation is at the mill, okay?
Now get me out of here!
Drop it.
Stay down!
Stay down.
You okay?
I thought I warned you, Chris.
I didn' t want this to happen.
I' m going in!
Deni, now!
I' m sorry.
I' m sorry.
- Where is everybody?
- Pete ran outside.
You stabbed me with a potato peeler.
You gonna be okay?
Hey, Chris.
Get up, Jay.
Remember when we used to play hide- and- seek up here?
- That was my favorite sound.
- Get up!
Look, Chris...
You want to know what my new favorite sound' s gonna be?
The sound of you screaming like a little bitch.
Bet you wish you took that job offer now?
You had to be Mr. Hero Boy!
You forgot this:
This is my town!
You' re nothing.
This does change our relationship.
This is my town.
You' re under arrest.
What are you doing?
I' m gonna miss the place.
That' s how it starts.
Next you' il be accepting bribes and setting speed traps all over town.
Cutting up trucks.
You know how you are.
Not to mention the cavity searches.
You' re gonna like that.
Speaking of which, do you think Jay' s got a casino in the pen?
- Could be.
- Running the Shower Tower with the fellas?
He' s probably blowing on somebody' s dice right now.
That' s lunch.
I' m with you, buddy.
Let me put this another way.
If I am not given complete and unfettered command of this situation...... you can, if I may put it politely, sir...... take this job and put it where you choose because I' II damn weII quit.
My other generals say it' s unwise.
Too much responsibility for one man.
Then find other generals.
Even your own other generals say the same thing.
Then I' II also find new ones.
I know who we' re talking about here, prime minister.
Your Air MarshaI Harris and my GeneraI Jimmy Spaatz.
The RAF and the U. S. 8th Air Force want to fight their own war.
Win it with strategic bombing.
- They think -- - I know what they think, general.
And it is very seductive.
Continue the saturation bombing of the Continent...... untiI the enemy' s Iost his wiII to fight.
Leave him defeated and dispirited...... before your invasion force even sets foot ashore.
If there' s a shore to set foot on.
That kind of bombing would turn Paris into a soccer field...... HoIland into a swimming pool.
You were an infantry officer, prime minister.
We both know wars can only be won on the ground.
America did not send a miIlion of its finest men to stand by...... while faceless aircraft destroy the Europe they' re wiIling to die to save.
And I don' t believe you raIlied the British people to fight on, alone...... aII these Iong years to bear so much...... only to see the great cities of Europe become heaps of rubble.
We have to save it.
We' re soldiers, you and I.
There can only be one commander.
One conductor of this orchestra.
One supreme commander...... in the air, on the ground, at sea.
Or face interservice bickering, clashing egos...... conflicting operationaI deployments.
One invasion, one commander.
A sampling of this morning' s editoriaI contribution:
"As the AIlies prepare for our greatest chaIlenge of the war...... our Ieaders must not Iose sight...... of the true measure of military Ieadership.
The victories of GeneraI Montgomery...... at EI Alamein, Sicily and every campaign he has undertaken...... deserve prime consideration.
His hand is never far from such forward momentum...... as we have enjoyed in this war.
No other generaI can make that claim. "
I could go on, but they' re aII much of a muchness.
I don' t deny Monty' s achievements as a field commander.
Whilst you can make no such claim.
Come, come, general.
Don' t take offense.
Monty' s not the man for this.
Far too in love with his image.
There' s no shortage of men who would Iike the title "supreme commander."
And I -- We must identify each man...... and decide whether or not he is fit.
Harris?
- Far too oblivious to destruction.
- Certainly not Spaatz.
Too flamboyant.
MarshaIl?
You know F. D. R. won' t Iet him Ieave Washington.
And Mountbatten is commanding in the Pacific.
Then who?
Your own Mr. Roosevelt has his doubts about a supreme commander.
I Ieave him to you, sir.
You' II be able to set him straight.
No human in history has ever held the power for which you now ask.
Not Caesar, not Alexander, no man.
Ever.
But this is Eisenhower you' re considering.
Is this relatively untried American the right man for the job?
- Very popular with the men.
Disciplined soldiers fight at their Ieader' s command...... whoever that might be.
My victories that brought us back North Africa...... weren' t won because I was popular with the ordinary ranks.
No, I dare say.
Brandy?
- No, thank you.
- Oh, I forgot your strict scruples.
General, Iet it not come as a surprise to you.
The decision is as good as made.
There wiII be no turning back.
Eisenhower is to be supreme commander.
That is the consensus of the AIlies.
Politics first, is it?
Yes?
Yes, chief whip?
Time to prepare for the afternoon question period, prime minister.
One Iast thought, prime minister.
There' s more than one way to skin this cat.
If things remain as they are...... Iet Eisenhower be the de facto figurehead.
Just don' t formalize it.
Leave some room for the rest of us.
Oh, I' m sure you' II find some way to maneuver, general.
You know my admiration for your soldiering skiIls.
There are two kinds of problem drinkers, chief whip.
Those who drink too much and those who drink too Iittle.
I believe it' s a religious thing with the general.
Oh, might be an asset.
Way the odds are on this thing...... we could use somebody on close terms with God.
Giving Monty a private audience?
You could caII it that.
Man' s a pain in the ass.
Kind of megalomaniac who' s got his own ideas how to win this war.
He' II never accept you.
I admire ChurchiII much as any man...... but not even he could seII that without some sticking in the craw.
ChurchiIl' s not there to seIl.
His job is making decisions.
Mine is to make them work.
Yeah, weIl, you' re tough enough to make it happen.
Even with the generals and admirals he offended.
I' m glad you feeI that way because if we fouI up...... we' II end up sharing a supply desk in Washington.
You' d Iose your operationaI rank.
- Remember '38 in the summer?
- Yeah.
We figured we' d be passed over...
-... and mustered out within a year.
- Yes, as colonels.
- So we' d stiII be ahead of the game.
Now, teII me about the tanks in the sand.
Those beaches aren' t reaIly sand.
They' re pebble and rock.
Your 3: 00 meeting is here.
Your unfriendly friendly.
I' II slip out the back.
Needlessly timid, if you ask me.
And I trust you are asking me.
That' s why we' re here.
For a frank discussion, just you and me.
Good.
Like aII battles, this one wiII be won on the ground.
But not necessarily by infantry men, one foot at a time.
Armor can slash through first, Ieaving infantry to consolidate gains...... but that requires a flexible master plan.
We might find a sudden Iunge across the Iow countries, a dagger aimed...... at the heart of Berlin could end the war by Christmas.
The concept for a broad Ianding at Normandy has been approved.
Given the politicaI sensibilities involved...... there' s no going back on that.
You' re the supreme commander.
The politics are your concern.
My interest is the most effective strategy...... and tacticaI moves to support it.
A massive invasion wiII be tipped to Jerry' s inteIligence, we know that.
He' II be ready to defend across a broad front.
A slashing blow wiII be harder for him to concentrate his troops against...... with any depth.
Unless the German knows where the slashing blow is coming.
Then, as you put it, with his inteIligence alerted....
You' re being inflexible.
I' m adhering to a master plan.
Once we have established beachhead, we can reexamine our options.
I see.
And as commander of aII Iand forces, I' II have my say in that reexamination?
Absolutely.
Now, Iet me outline my expectations...... for your ground forces once ashore.
Here, the ground slopes easily.
Sir, it wouldn' t take more than 1 5 minutes.
Fifteen minutes better spent on reaI work, captain.
With respect, sir, public relations is reaI work.
I know you don' t have time for the press...... but folks back home need to know you.
Human face of the Ieader, sir.
Mr. Roosevelt is their Ieader, and mine.
- Yeah, but -- - Interview division commanders.
Try some platoon sergeants.
What about my chief of staff, GeneraI Smith?
What do you say, Beetle?
Want to show the world your human face?
Sorry, sir.
I wasn' t issued one.
This isn' t MacArthur' s HQ, where he has to be at the center of everything.
So go get some publicity for the running backs.
That is aIl.
Yes, sir.
- He' s arrived.
I could hardly miss it.
Beetle, he' s briIliant, but sometimes he acts Iike a child.
Are you thinking of sending him home?
Let' s have him.
He' II see you now.
- You gonna keep the helmet on?
- Damn right.
I think you know why you' re here.
Some prep- head politician stateside got pissed at the truth.
That' s neither more nor Iess, George.
It' s damned ignorant.
"Anglo- Saxons to rule the postwar world." What the heII is that?
When this is over, it wiII be us and the Brits...... have to put the world back together.
That' s gonna come as a surprise to Stalin...... who' s Iosing miIlions on the eastern front.
Yeah, communism' s for the next war.
Goddamn it, George.
Shut up.
The Czechs are also in this war.
And the Dutch and the Danes and God knows who else.
And above aIl...... it' s racialism.
It' s the very thing we' re fighting.
I can' t have my generals spouting idiocy Hitler would applaud.
Anglo- Saxon superiority?
That' s exactly the kind of pigheaded crap...... that wiII make Stalin think we are the next enemy.
Sometimes I think you don' t have the vaguest idea why we' re fighting.
- It is if it' s true.
I' m not sending a bunch of fresh young kids from Iowa and California...... and New York and Nebraska to die on French beaches for the freedom...... of people they know nothing about so we can establish a new raciaI order.
I' m asking them to die to prevent precisely that.
And they' re ready to do it.
And that' s why they' re heroes.
And why slapping a sheIl- shocked soldier as a malingerer is never...... never permissible!
Do you understand me, sir?
You should know that despite the fact...... that he doubts your worthiness to command...... that GeneraI MarshaII has Ieft it to me to decide how to handle this.
So I ask you again.
Do you understand?
Sir, yes, sir.
I understand completely.
I do, Ike.
I swear I do.
What I don' t get, I' II study.
I promise.
I swear, I promise.
Just please...... don' t send me home.
Please, Ike.
I couldn' t bear to be in Washington when the show starts.
Don' t do that to me.
I promise you.
Soldier to soldier.
Soldier to soldier.
I wish it were that simple.
You were my mentor.
My senior officer, who told me once a Iong time ago...... that one day I' d be giving him orders.
WeIl, that day' s come, George.
And that' s the truth.
Soldier to soldier.
Last time, Georgie.
Last time.
Thank you.
Sir, may I return to my headquarters now?
Gentlemen.
Played him Iike a violin.
Ate out of my hand, he did.
- How' d it go?
- I' m keeping him on.
Probably thinks he put one over on me.
HeIl, maybe he did.
Let' s keep him in Maidenhead, commanding his fictitious army.
Now RommeI thinks he' s my ace.
Besides, once we get ashore, I' II need him...... to command reaI tanks.
Traff, what you got?
Early estimates of airborne Iosses.
No crosswind at the drop zone, Iosses could be Iow as 8 percent.
But should any of the elements turn against us, casualties wiII spiral.
They might hit a quarter or more.
One in four.
What' s the split between wounded and dead?
Oh, with paratroopers, one might as weII assume they' re aII dead.
A wounded jumper is a cripple.
And we aII know this enemy.
I' m ahead of you.
What the heII time is it?
It' s 0520.
But you want to be woken for this.
In from Southwest Command, just decoded.
AII chiefs of staff in the map room, 20 minutes.
No doubt in your mind about this?
The craft' s scars could only be made by Krupp Essen U- 2 1 0 torpedoes.
Then the German is right off the coast.
Too much for a Ioner.
Absolutely.
This was a fuII pack.
In daylight, C- search patrols can spot E- boats...... as soon as they come close enough to fire torpedoes.
But at night, under radar....
Then what in damnation were men doing out there after nightfaIl?
Landing- craft drivers were having a difficult time...... managing these new duplex- drive craft.
They' re fragile in anything but good weather.
Division commander felt they needed more experience.
Then the man is a damned fooI and should be relieved of his command.
You won' t find any of my divisionaI commanders...... playing siIly buggers with Jerry concealed.
How many Ianding craft Iost?
First estimates are at 1 1, possibly 1 2.
Any intercepted Jerry signals?
E- boat captains radioed Berlin, claiming two dozen.
We went on the air with a decodable signal...... to Patton' s fictitious army...... saying it Iost five Ianding craft.
First reports back from SignaI Corps...... indicate Jerry bought the whole program.
I' d be surprised if Jerry' s reaIly buying the idea...... that the bulk of our forces are in the east.
Not with activity in the southwest.
I take your point.
But we have fake tanks, trucks and Ianding craft...... deployed throughout that entire region.
And our psychologicaI warfare squads in Norwich...... generate more radio traffic than our entire force doubled.
They use a new magnetic wire that records Morse messages...... and repeats it night and day.
From what we monitor...... the Germans have moved a fuII signaI battalion to Dieppe...... in order to sort it out.
We have Patton' s HQ in Maidenhead.
The enemy is certain he wiII be field commander of any AIlied invasion.
- They can' t imagine anyone else.
If Hitler had half his wits about him, he' d be on Monty' s taiI night and day.
And there is no sign that the 3rd Air Fleet, the 1 6th Army...... or any of 1 6 panzer divisions southward.
I think we fooled them.
He believes Patton' s fictitious army is real.
He' s not reaIly watching Normandy.
- For now, at Ieast.
Rommel' s no fool.
Sooner or Iater, he' II figure out there' s a Iimit...... to the size of our force, send flights...... to inspect Patton' s army and discover...... that aII his tanks and trucks are nothing but papier- mache.
TeII me about these men we Iost.
And what is this duplex- drive problem on the damn Ianding craft?
WeIl, the men caII them Donald Ducks...... because they' re not that easy to understand.
It takes practice to reach the skiII IeveI necessary...... to master the two output Ievels.
One for the high seas and the other for soft Iandings on a beach.
We were short of the bloody things before.
That' s an entire battalion' s passage gone.
Could be a month before we get replacement craft.
It' s only 1 9 days to the half- moon and the right high tide.
That would be June 5th, sir.
AII this dithering around is bloody annoying, GeneraI Eisenhower.
My men are ready to go.
I say the sooner the better.
Leaving it to June is a tremendous risk.
We have to put it off to July.
It' s not enough to Iand the army.
We have to get tanks ashore, get inland...... before the worst of autumn weather slows us down.
What can you give me in June, Stagg?
Expecting a fine English summer, sir.
I mean, meteorology' s a fair bit of witchcraft...... but aII indications are for one of our better Junes.
Three extra weeks means at Ieast 1 00 more LSTs.
Give us more time to pulverize the raiI Iines out of Germany.
- And railheads in France.
- The men are impatient.
- And sooner or Iater...... we won' t be able to hide the size of our force in the southwest.
May 1 9th or June 5th?
Or the fail- safe Iast chance in July?
Mid- July.
Leaving maybe eight weeks, if there' s an early frost...... to establish a beachhead for half a miIlion men.
How doable is that?
That' s what I thought.
Please have it factored in for the next meeting, gentlemen.
Thank you.
I know the reason you' re here.
Of course, the Ioss of these men is....
Yes, of course.
But I was referring to your other reason.
Other reason?
You have the advantage over me, sir.
I certainly hope so.
It' s my job.
I am told you' ve committed to June.
Given up on a May Ianding.
I assume Monty kept you informed.
No names, no pack driIl.
But of course, general, you are in Britain.
You must assume I have resources to keep myself in the picture.
And I understand from Mr. Roosevelt...... that the additionaI time wiII increase the number...... of these newfangled Ianding craft.
The president is my security Ieak?
Hardly.
But even if he were, he is your superior.
And my good friend and aIly.
Never forget, general, you serve at our pleasure.
Then if it please you, sir, we need to delay tiII June 4 or 5.
By then, we wiII have 1 00 more Ianding craft.
So...... the fate of our two great nations comes down...... to things caIled LSTs and Donald Ducks.
WeIl, if it be so, so be it.
And yes, general, I accede to you once more.
June it is.
Good.
Thank you.
But that raises another problem, sir.
Further delay creates almost unbearable pressure on our security.
We can' t Iet the Germans sense we' re only making a feint at Calais.
If RommeI moves his main force to Normandy, we' d be stacking bodies.
There' s only one way to be certain that German spies...... or Ioose Iips don' t stumble across our activities...... and anticipate our moves.
That is to seaI the coast across the south of England and Wales...... to aII unauthorized traffic.
I mean aII of it.
No civilian traffic whatsoever.
Are you mad, sir?
Do you not realize that no one in Britain...... Iives more than 1 50 miles from the sea?
It is no accident that Britannia rules the waves and aII that business.
We are a people whose entire destiny is Iinked to the sea.
Which is why you must now turn your people away from it.
Impossible.
It might mean thousands...... tens of thousands of young men' s Iives.
I wiII give you this, general.
You know how to take charge.
It' s not about power, sir.
It is simply the judicious use of the responsibility you entrusted me with.
Only under duress and your threats to walk out.
I' d have you remember that.
Yes, sir.
The Ministry of Information unedited footage...... spied by the 3rd Red army Film Corps.
The surrender of the German 7 th army.
Hitler refuses to allow further withdrawal.
Throws three panzer divisions from the western front to the east.
They' re on the APC.
Look at that.
One more reason to rethink a broad front.
Ride a dagger- thrust road straight to Berlin.
And we' II have the French to help us along.
Smuggled, unedited film from Warsaw Ghetto...... where Jews resist an entire German army for six weeks.
Twice as Iong as the weIl- fed French army in 1 940.
Don' t count on them to help us along.
Supreme commander meets with soldiers of the line.
Give me five minutes.
I' II have tonight' s feature ready.
- What have you got?
- Not bloody Iikely.
I' II be off, then.
I' II walk you out.
- It' s supposed to be a good movie.
- Not much taste for cinema, myself.
Besides, never enough time for preparation, is there?
WeIl, we aII need some recreation.
Movie once a week, Iet the hair down, it seems to do the trick.
Although, if you don' t mind me saying so...... that jeering when you came on the screen, a bit much, you know.
Good- natured, as I see it.
Undisciplined.
So is using German troop movements...... to push your plan for a dagger thrust again.
The broad assault is a closed matter.
I aIlow aII my sub- commanders Iatitude, general...... but restraint is also a virtue.
Yes, sir.
Point taken.
He Iooks cold.
Yeah.
But if we get our asses kicked, we won' t be walking across snowy tundra.
We' II have to swim back.
Truth is, I wasn' t Iooking at Napoleon.
I was thinking about the soldiers.
June 6th.
Proud moment.
Have your son succeed you at West Point.
Yeah, I can' t believe I won' t be there.
Cheer him and shake his hand.
You' II see him soon enough.
And when you do....
Yeah.
It stinks.
It does.
But any way you Iook at it, we' re getting off easy from this war.
I' II most Iikely Iive to see it over.
And my son won' t be in it for as Iong as most.
But on the other hand...... this war is stiII your burden.
And the rest of us, we' re just supporting cast.
If it' s any comfort...... so far, general, you are giving one heII of a great performance.
I don' t think I needed to hear my job described...... quite Iike that, GeneraI Smith.
I loved your crack at Monty about the French.
We bought them from Harrods.
- Harrods?
- Oh, he splashed out.
Wow, that is beautiful.
A Iousy wine, Edgar.
But not for Iong, huh?
Soon be downing the best French stuff.
I reckon four days from the beaches to Paris.
- Get there on the 8th.
- I have no idea...... what you' re talking about, Henry.
Watch it, colonel.
Remember who you' re talking to.
Don' t you damn weII forget it either, Henry.
Come, Edith, it' s time we powdered our noses.
Henry, you' re a goddamned idiot.
What' s the big deal?
The whole world wiII know soon enough.
He actuaIly said, "June 4th," in the hoteI griIl?
That place is packed that time of night.
What the heII was he thinking?
- He had too much to drink.
- Henry MiIler is a major general.
Entertaining guests with inside knowledge...... is a betrayaI of the men he commands.
Of course.
How' d Chapman get onto this?
A junior officer from the 1 01 st was at the next table.
He contacted his CO.
- WeIl, did you speak to the officer?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Young man from Philadelphia.
Feels awfuI about the thing.
Didn' t want to be thought a snitch.
But?
But he said he commanded a platoon of airborne infantry.
His chances were bad enough without making it easier for the Krauts.
Then he' s a damn sight better officer than MiIler.
And smarter.
Henry was a roommate at West Point.
One of my closest friends.
You know, the word stayed closed.
No one reaIly knows about it.
At ease.
Ike, I' m sorry.
I' m so sorry.
- I don' t know what got into me.
- I do.
I swear, I' II never touch another drop.
You' re Iying.
- So, what wiII you do with me?
- What do you think?
Oh, please.
Ike, don' t do this to me.
We go back too far.
We' re old friends.
It might be easier if we didn' t have so much history, Hank.
But the stakes are way too big.
You' II have to go home immediately...... and you won' t be coming back.
We both owe that to the men who wiII be dead in a few weeks.
I' II Iose my operationaI rank.
I' II go home in disgrace, a major.
You can' t send me home.
You owe me something.
I' m part of the inner circle.
That' s the worst thing you could have said.
There is no inner circle.
Only those who wiII Iive and those who wiII die.
And you don' t seem to get that.
Send him home immediately.
Loss of theater rank.
Try to keep him a coloneI if you can.
And on his record?
"Deemed more usefuI in HQ.
SkiIls not needed in theater of operation. "
The thing about aII the power, Beetle...... it isn' t the big decisions that weigh heavy.
HeIl, you can decide to invade Russia at dinner.
Pick Waterloo for battle on a whim.
It' s the details.
The smaII stuff.
It' s easy to gamble a miIlion Iives.
What' s hard...... is to see how that can hurt one single person.
And if you can' t keep that straight...... heIl...... you' II Iose your humanity.
Won' t you?
I couldn' t say, sir.
- Good morning, Beetle.
- Same to you.
I thought you quit smoking.
Ready for the big day?
It' s the big moment.
Anything good in the paper?
No, not reaIly.
It' s stateside, but, hey, it' s three days old.
Walter, you' re my chief of staff, not my HQ censor.
"While Ike' s a good administrator and a good organizer...... he Iacks the military flare of a Montgomery...... or the audacity of a Patton.
Yet, for better or worse, he' s the man they caII supreme commander. "
You know, Ike...... a Iittle public relations wouldn' t do any harm.
Oh, it would, and you know it.
We' re surrounded by some of the biggest sweIled heads in history.
My job is keeping them puIling together in the same direction.
I can' t do that if I' m competing with them for newspaper ink.
This is your plan.
You developed it.
You fought ChurchiII for it, aII the politicians, even F. D. R.
No, this is your show.
The world ought to know it.
One day, but not this day.
This day, we have other fish to fry, general.
- Now may I have some coffee?
- Yes, sir.
Oh, a point of principle, old man.
A bad habit in my opinion.
Never been permitted in my HQ.
Oh, aII right, Monty, if it' s so damned important to you.
I did agree to use your ground for this.
ChurchiII makes the finaI decision on what they buy.
But don' t overseIl.
He can smeII buII pucky a mile away.
You are acquainted with Eisenhower, an American cousin.
Good to see you again.
Prime minister teIls us we may have great confidence in this undertaking.
Oh, I never disagree with Mr. ChurchiIl, Your Majesty.
Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth.
How delighted we are to see you again, general.
We Iook forward to our private Iuncheon next week.
As do I, ma' am.
General, if you please.
Excuse me.
Your Majesties, Mr. Prime Minister...... honored guests, dignitaries, I' m Dwight Eisenhower...... commander in chief, Supreme Headquarters...... AIlied Expeditionary Force, European Theater of Operation.
Just getting the title straight is tiring enough.
So I wiII Ieave much of today' s business...... to my trusted and gifted coIleagues, brothers- in- arms.
We are from different traditions, different services...... but we are united in this crusade.
We shaII Iiberate Europe.
We shaII restore freedom.
We shaII make the world safe for democracy.
There is no other cause so urgent as to bring us so far from our homes.
This is our purpose.
This is Operation Overlord.
Explaining how we wiII succeed is best done by my chiefs of staff...... starting with GeneraI Montgomery...... commander, 2 1 st Army Group and responsible for aII our Iand forces.
General, if you wiIl.
Your Majesties.
Of the enemy' s 60 divisions in France, 1 0 are armored.
Commanded by Erwin Rommel.
As you know, I faced him in the desert and bested him.
But make no mistake, RommeI is an energetic --
Clever, putting Monty front and center. -- so he can bring his tanks southward.
But we shaII make a strike forward here.
I hope to make Falaise 32 miles inland within 40 hours.
Paratroopers wiII totaI over 30, 000 men.
The Iargest drop in history.
Casualties wiII be high...... but the size of the force should draw two enemy divisions...... from the beaches, just as our men are ready to disembark.
To take the Ieft flank...... we need to Iand enough men to swamp Hitler' s Atlantic waIl.
Losses amongst the British and Canadian troops...... wiII be heavy during the assault wave...... but easing off as they move past the piIlboxes.
While fighter command provides cover for the beach assault...... and strafes the Atlantic waIl...... GeneraI Spaatz wiII smash the raiI Iinks Ieading south from La Manche...... delaying any attempt by RommeI to reinforce his southern defenses.
WeIl, Your Majesties, gentlemen, there it is.
We' re anxious to hear your thoughts, additions, criticisms.
The floor is open.
I am impressed by the detail...... the comprehensiveness of your planning.
But the expected Iosses, the sheer carnage....
I also ache at that thought, Your Majesty.
I remember my first trip to Europe as a young man.
I felt blessed to be here, to see it...... to touch the origins of my own country that I love so dearly.
I hoped one day that aII Americans would have the same opportunity.
Now hundreds of thousands wiIl, along with Britons and Canadians...... and European AIlies fighting to return home.
This kind of visit isn' t what I had in mind...... but if they do not offer the sacrifice of blood now...... we wiII aII pay dearly with added gaIlons Iater.
So if some must die...... it is in a worthy cause.
I am in this thing with you tiII the very end...... and if it fails, we both go down together.
It' s dicey to get out on a Iimb with disturbances over Baffin Island.
If they form a front and move across the North Atlantic, this time of year...... I' d say six days for a top- speed journey...... and with the proposed Ianding a week away....
You realize that this may be...... the most important weather forecast in history.
I do indeed, sir.
I' d feeI a Iot more comfortable...... if I could have another two days before committing.
-... we' re gonna miss the tide, sir.
- I' II be damned if I wait tiII July.
The men wiII go stark raving mad.
June 5 is a go.
Issue the movement orders.
We' II do it proud, Ike.
I' II be in Falaise in 72 hours, Paris by the autumn.
Paris in the faIl.
No one can say you don' t tackle things with two fists.
I admire confidence.
Let' s aII get some of that.
AII of you...... Godspeed.
Thank you.
Good Iuck.
You' re sure this is how you want it, general?
Yes, prime minister.
You see no value to me or President Roosevelt...... speaking directly to the people of Europe?
Not untiI the Iandings are an assured success.
This way, if it fails, I wiII be the first one to address...... the question of the invasion.
You and the president wiII be blameless.
I' m expendable.
You two are not.
Shoulder the whole burden alone to the very end, is it?
One conductor is what I asked for and what you' ve given me.
You' ve made the manly choice.
I admire it.
AII the same, between we two...... surely God himself must tremble at the task that Iies before you.
And it is God' s work you do, Ike...... for you hold aII our Iives in your hands.
If I do God' s work, then he wiII be at my side, and I cannot fail.
Although, candidly, God hasn' t been much help with DeGauIle.
Not even God could move him.
And it' s no use Iooking to me.
DeGauIle hates me.
He ignores that France is coIlaborating with the enemy.
Pretends Vichy doesn' t exist and Jews aren' t being rounded up.
A horrid man...... but he guards French prerogatives jealously.
Take another run at him, Ike.
I' II back any bargain you strike.
Would you just assure me of one thing?
The sands on these Norman beaches...... dense enough for tanks?
You can drink to it, sir.
Do you get the feeling Europeans...... have been at this war thing for a Iong time?
Too Iong.
It' s almost as if they Iike war.
Sounds Iike Shakespeare had it aII figured out.
Yeah.
But he was writing after the war was over and won.
It' s spooky...... Iistening to words written 400 years ago about our battlefields.
Words about blood and grief.
Very spooky.
But if I may, ours is not to reason why.
Of course it is.
We' re the generals.
I think Monty' s got ChurchiII worried that the beaches won' t hold the tanks.
I' ve told you a hundred times, we' ve done our homework.
The sand wiII support the tank track rails with ease.
I don' t think that' s what' s bothering you.
- You read MarshaIl' s Ietter.
- About the paratroopers?
Yes, I did.
- What' d you make of it?
He says drop the jumpers behind the beaches.
Try to draw the Germans in two directions.
If I were Rommel, I' d ignore them.
Concentrate everything on the beach.
I' d do the same.
Every hour I delay the invasion force from moving in...... would be another hour airborne units would be isolated.
Besides, I need those men...... aII 30, 000 of them, to keep nipping at the Krauts' heels.
They have to be close to force RommeI to deaI with them.
Yeah, but the drop zones, Brad.
You heard Leigh- MaIlory' s estimate of Iosses with a close drop.
How would a distant drop be better?
If inland progress was slow, we' d have those men...... wandering around France Iooking for something to eat.
We' d be repeating the mistake we made in Anzio.
MarshaIl' s a godfather to us, Brad.
I hate to cross the old man.
It' s Iike a friend of mine said:
"One supreme commander, one voice."
I hope the main attraction' s a bit more cheerful.
It' s Rita Hayworth.
A heII of a Iot easier on the eye than that bunch.
Dearest Mamie...... at last, the days grow longer, and we will soon be in it.
I face that with neither dread nor joy.
How I wish this cruel business of war could be completed quickly.
It leaves me heartsick to think of sending so many men...... against Hitler' s Atlantic wall.
I admit to having developed a veneer of callousness...... but counting the human cost is a terribly sad business...... and no veneer of callousness allows me to escape the truth...... that back home, the news brings anguish and suffering.
So many youngsters already gone forever.
Mothers, fathers, brothers...... sisters back home have a difficult time...... retaining any belief in the eternal rightness of things.
There is no true glory in war.
Yes, sir.
At 0900.
Yes.
InteIligence signals confirm RommeI moved the 1 1 6th Panzer Division...... basing at VerviIle.
Is it a single redeployment or part of Iarger movement?
So far, just a one- shot affair, but he bypassed Juno, Sword and Gold...... and sent them directly to Utah and Omaha.
That doesn' t change my view.
We have to have the airborne as close as possible.
I need jumpers breathing down the Germans' necks...... puIling them around.
The plan always caIled for the diversion to be --
I know!
I know.
- You' re new here.
What' s your name?
- CorporaI WiIliam Younger, ma' am.
AII right, now remember, we hear nothing in this room.
And we never speak.
The king himself may enter, but what we' re doing must take priority.
Now carry on.
- They deserve a force at the Krauts' -- - Stop.
I know the risks for both sides...... but neither of you makes a decisive case.
How many ways can I say it?
I' m counting on those jumpers to split German attention...... ease pressure on the assault wave.
And they should have, but that was before RommeI redeployed.
One division isn' t a redeployment.
For men in my drop, it' s a potentiaI disaster.
Jumpers and glider- borne troops are sitting ducks...... for the first 1 0 minutes untiI they regroup.
There goes another.
It' s the 81 st Infantry.
Wehrmacht, conscripts, the crack units are to the north.
But if Jerry' s reinforcing the whole damn region...... we Iose 70 percent of glider troops before they' re out of planes.
And the jumpers?
Some of them wiII make it, but they' II be short of the numbers you need...... if seaborne Iandings are depending on airborne to distract Jerry.
You' re saying there' s no middle ground.
We don' t want the slaughter of two fine divisions.
The 1 01 st and the 82nd are elite, Ike.
We' II need them on June 5th.
Otherwise the entire German army...... wiII Iet Ioose on my assault waves.
My Ioss wiII be 70 percent.
AII right.
I' ve heard both sides.
I need a night to sleep on it.
Sorry to disturb, sir.
If it' s good news.
WeIl, sir, I wish I could say it was...... but it' s getting a Iittle bit uncertain.
You said it would take days for systems...... to get from Baffin Island to here.
Unless they dislodge from the jet stream...... a meteorologicaI possibility, they' re not --
I can' t work with possibilities, group captain.
At minimum, I need probabilities.
Are there such things as meteorologicaI probabilities?
There wiII be, sir, within hours.
I need hourly reports.
Yes, sir.
He doesn' t make weather.
Then get him to say nicer things.
Look, give me some time to work on this airborne thing.
I' II send for you when I' ve figured it out.
Yes.
What is it?
Our friends at HQ say the airborne decision is at a head.
If you' re to be heard, now would be the hour, sir.
And what do you think, Wiatt?
Inland, they' re no help to the Ianding force.
Keep them close, they could be shredded.
Let' s see how he works it out.
Thank you, Wiatt.
If I may...... it' s the right decision.
DivisionaI commanders can' t factor in weather and the seas...... supplies, navaI support, DeGauIle, the politics.
Besides, it' s not their job.
I' II inform Leigh- MaIlory and Brad.
Don' t publish that order untiI I do.
You better get some sleep.
You have another dragon to slay tomorrow.
I' ve considered it.
Either way, some units wiII sustain devastating Iosses.
But this invasion is Iargely dependent on sea and air power.
Our Iand troops are inferior...... if for no other reason than they' re not on Iand.
So our most important job is securing beachheads.
Deference must be given to protecting troops trying to come ashore...... to clear the way for the armor and artiIlery that wiII push RommeI back.
That being the case, despite the projected Iosses, Traff...... even 70 percent, the airborne operation has to go.
It' s the toughest choice I' ve ever had to make.
Do everything to diminish the hazards.
Go over every detaiI a thousand times.
But as painfuI as it is, those soldiers wiII have to bear the rough portion.
GeneraI Bradley' s assault troops must be given every edge we can find.
A perfectly sound decision.
We' II keep Jerry watching out for his backside.
You get yours to those jumpers as soon as you can.
Count on it.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Brad?
When he wakes up, I' m seeing ChurchiIl.
- He' s gonna bring it up -- - WiII you Iay off?
I' ve told you, the sand wiII hold.
We tested with Iight bombing.
Resistance gave measurements.
If the first of those storms hits the beaches the same time we do...... you' re Iooking at 2 inches of rain.
Maybe 20- foot sweIls, eating at the beaches.
Huge erosion.
Would you stiII go in that kind of weather?
If we don' t go now....
A Iot can happen in three weeks.
RommeI can move more men.
So I ask you again, my good friend, what if the conditions are marginal?
The beaches wiII be firm.
You can trust me on this and not worry yourself about it further.
- Thank you, general.
- General.
Attention!
Thank you for taking the time to join us, general.
Not even your headman' s Kansas charm can melt the French iceberg.
Don' t bet on it.
GeneraI officer!
As you were.
Come, general.
Let me provide you with some details.
Prime minister.
If the Frenchman can back up his manner...... he should be able to controI the weather for us.
AII we want is he teIls the French to welcome us.
Neutrality might mean they' II work against us...... Iike some did at Dunkirk.
My, my.
Seems that our work isn' t up to the general' s Ievel.
GeneraI DeGauIle, I trust your confidence is buoyed.
I think your Operation Overlord is poorly conceived.
I have explained its failures to GeneraI Eisenhower.
He has aII the information to make the necessary corrections.
I' m gratefuI for the general' s contributions.
I' II explain them to you aII Iater.
Although, as I' ve told the general, with regret...... we simply don' t have the time to make the changes suggested.
Perhaps...... you could use a moment alone...... to discuss other matters?
Yes, sir.
General?
What do you expect from me, general?
- This is, after aIl, your speech.
But it is to be broadcast to the French people on the eve of their Iiberation.
I was hoping for your support since we recognize you...... as their Iegitimate voice.
There is no one else.
So I shaII give my own address when the time comes.
As, of course, you must.
But it is our hope, our urgent hope...... that you' II endorse my remarks...... and that is why my speech should concern you.
Your remarks concern me greatly, GeneraI Eisenhower.
But not for the reasons you might Iike.
Okay, what' s wrong with it?
Firstly, you urge Frenchmen to foIlow your orders?
Only I wiII command the people of France.
I understand that.
But this operation can only work if it speaks with one voice.
So they say.
You even ask my people to accept AIlied money.
Yet, as president of the provisionaI government, only I can issue currency.
You say IocaI administrations wiII stay in place.
Only I shaII decide what to do with Vichy officials.
No, no.
I' II never accept...... that you can speak for aII the AIlies.
The British have.
The Canadians, the Australians, the exiled Dutch and Poles.
Roosevelt and ChurchiII have agreed.
Come to think of it, you' re the only exception.
You wiII not treat us Iike Italy.
We are not German aIlies.
In fact, the Vichy government is precisely that, general.
But we wiII Iiberate France and treat her as an aIly nonetheless.
AII I ask is that you speak on the radio after my address...... and caII on your people to aid us in their Iiberation.
Speak after you?
That would imply I approve of your program.
I understand.
AIlow me to see you to your car.
- You' re wet, Stagg.
It started raining.
- I find that very depressing.
- Depressing.
WeIl, three depressions, actuaIly.
One after the other.
They roIled in from Baffin Island in unbelievably quick time.
- I' ve never seen it Iike -- - How Iong before they pass through?
- AII three?
- Yes.
Might be some calm in between them.
Meantime, we' re Iooking at sweIls of up to 40 feet mid- Channel...... 30- feet breakers on the Ianding zones...... and winds of up to 50 miles an hour.
We can' t get the gliders and C- 4 7 s off the ground.
Even if we did, they' d be blown aII over Europe when they jumped.
Embarkation status, Birdie?
Crew' s aboard ship, vessel' s fuIly Ioaded.
Mulberries and LST is fueled.
More crafts stiII at mooring.
C- 4 7 s in place.
Men ready for boarding on 30 minutes' notice.
We can' t send them.
They' II drown before they arrive.
True enough.
But we have to calculate the margins.
This might work to our advantage.
It' s certain Jerry won' t expect an invasion force in this weather.
Of course, it is up to you.
-... we can' t wait forever.
- No.
But we can wait one more day.
We owe the men that.
Disembarkation is delayed 2 4 hours to Tuesday.
We meet at 01 30 hours tomorrow morning to finalize.
Sir, there' s a definite break almost immediately at hand.
What kind of break?
This dreadfuI torrent that seems...... ready to wash us away wiII Iift in three hours or so.
For how Iong?
What' s off the Irish coast?
But even at top speed...... it would need 36 hours to reach the Normandy coast.
Meanwhile, winds wiII moderate.
The bombers should be able to operate starting tomorrow...... and right into June 6th.
At best, a moderately good night for drop zones.
For air power, generaIly.
Heavy and medium bombers wiII find the going, weIl, chancy at best.
True, but we could press our entire force of bombers into service.
They' d operate weII in these conditions.
Yes.
But if Stagg could give us a Iarger window on the 7th --
I' d take comfort in that.
I' m not ready to give up on the 6th, Stagg.
Sir.
Would you know more by 0200 hours, son?
I expect we' d have a better sense of the speed...... of the next storm' s approach.
I' m afraid that' s not good enough, old man.
The American force has the Iongest sea journey.
Now, they must put to sea in the next half- hour...... if Overlord' s to happen on the 6th.
And further, if you have AdmiraI Kirk set saiI then recaII his fleet...... for worsening weather, he can' t refuel.
- Won' t be ready in time for the 7th.
Tides and moon won' t be in the right alignment on the 8th.
Any reason we shouldn' t go on the 6th, Monty?
I would say go.
One heII of a gamble to go now.
- Very chancy.
The question is, how Iong can we hang this operation...... on the end of a Iimb and just Iet it dangle there?
I' m quite positive the order must be given.
SignaI wiII go to the fleet immediately, sir.
We meet again at 0400 hours for a report on their progress.
That' II be our Iast chance to hold off tiII July.
FinaIly going as I predicted, sir.
The break is almost upon us.
Long- range forecast stiII unpleasant...... but I can promise the weather wiII clear in a matter of hours.
Gentlemen.
I command you...... but you command the men I' m about to throw into battle.
One Iast go- round, please.
WeIl, they' re almost in the Channel.
The weather front is moving faster than the ships.
By the time the LSTs reach IandfaIl, sea shaII be calm.
I say, no turning back.
- Agreed.
- A dark day for airborne, I' m afraid.
WeIl, if there is to be a recaIl, it must be now.
Let' s go.
Last one at the dance?
Or the first?
HeIl, that' s just the way it is, Beetle.
One minute I' m exactly what ChurchiII described...... the most powerfuI man in history.
Now the order' s given.
HeIl, I' m just audience.
Front row, center, to be sure.
But a corporaI on Juno, a private on Utah...... they' re the ones who wiII affect the outcome, not me.
It' s up to them now.
Yes, sir.
AII right.
Ten minutes to onload.
Just enough time for a visitor.
The supreme commander himself is coming to see us off.
HeIl, I' II bet he ain' t coming with, boys.
It' s not his job.
Besides, he hasn' t earned his Jump Wings.
Here' s the protocol.
Do not speak unless spoken to.
If he asks you a question...... you' II find that generals are not interested in the personal.
Be prepared to answer questions such as:
Where you trained, where you did jump school.
What kind of medals and ribbons you' ve earned.
AII right?
Seven out of 1 0, Beetle.
In God' s hands, sir.
At ease.
Gather around.
That' s an order, jumpers.
Smoke them if you got them.
- Where you from, son?
- Basic at Dix, jumped at Bragg, sir.
Corporal, I asked where you' re from.
You had a Iife before the Army, didn' t you?
You bet I did, sir.
I' m a Chicago boy.
- Southside.
- Good for you.
- How about you?
- New Orleans, sir.
Nebraska, sir.
That' s the wrong team, jumper.
- Anybody here from Kansas?
- Go get them, Jayhawks.
- You bet.
- Here we come.
- Yeah!
- AII ready, then?
No, we ain' t worried, general.
It' s the Krauts that ought to be worrying now.
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have a Iight?
- Yes, I do, Iieutenant.
- Thank you, sir.
Our landings on the French coast have failed...... to gain a satisfactory foothold, and I have withdrawn the troops.
My decision to attack at this time and place was based upon...... the best information available.
If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt, it is mine alone.
If it aII goes wrong, if Overlord fails...... give that to the press.
Of course, Overlord did not fail.
How could it?
With so many fine young men and women from all corners of the earth...... all determined to do their best to free a world gone half- mad.
There would be setbacks.
There would be small triumphs, even in the first few hours.
A message from Leigh- MaIlory.
Read it.
"Urgent.
But I have the great pleasure in doing so on this occasion.
Casualties are dramaticaIly below my estimates.
I congratulate you on your command decision...... and apologize for adding to the supreme commander' s worries.
Leigh- MaIlory. "
- Any numbers?
- Early estimates...... about 20 percent.
Twenty percent is so much better than 7 0.
But the loss of even one of this gallant band is a loss...... to all decent humanity everywhere.
And besides, if the person killed in action is you or the one you love...... then the odds are 1 00 percent in that case.
They knew that, these great crusaders.
Too many of them are now with God.
We may never see their like again.
We may never see their like again.

Three weeks into school, and you haven' t cut once.
I like it.
Maybe I won' t have to send you to Sister Mary Margaret' s after all.
School...... or Simple Plan video shoot?
I' m here today as a finalist for the McGill Fellowship.
What excuses shall we use this time, Ringo?
Ringo?
Ringo, where are you?
"Death of a pet, religious holiday...... female problems." Last week.
"illnesses.
Chickenpox. "Print.

- Perfect.
Thank you, New York City!
Ringo, there you are.
Did the little mean lady scare you?
Yes, I know she did.
Why do you insist on playing Mom?
Dad doesn' t have time for breakfast.
Not listening.
- Hi.
- Your breakfast is on the table.
- Smells great.
Wait.
- Thanks.
You' re welcome.
Never, ever touch my day planner.
Okay, you need to chill on the nerd book, okay?
You have issues.
Okay, how frequent are the contractions?
Have them head down to the hospital.
Yeah.
- Jane...
- No, Dad, it' s fine.
No, it' s not fine.
I know this is your big day.
I will do everything I can to get to Columbia to see your speech.
- I know you will.
- Okay, excuse me.
Jane, sorry, I know this is the biggest day of your academic career...... but Dad, will you sign my field- trip permission form, please?
Shakespeare in the Park?
Great!
Which play?
You know, the one with the girl and the guy...... Iove, the tights, hair.
- Romeo and Juliet?
- Yeah!
Thank you.
I totally blanked.
- I love that play.
- I know.
Me too.
- Your mom would have been so proud.
- Would you mind giving your sister a lift?
- Not at all.
It wouldn' t kill you to spend time together.
Okay.
Well, then, take this, okay?
- Thank you.
- You' re welcome.
- Love you.
- Love you too.
Good luck.
- I hope you don' t get caught.
- I won' t.
- Let' s get the show on the road.
- Think about a car wash.
You might wanna think about buying a car.
- I' m saving up for college.
- That makes one of us.
Mind putting on the radio?
- Not at all.
- What is this?
Too cool for school.
Where are we going?
We have 26 minutes to get to the station...... and I can' t be late.
We just have to make a pit stop at my manager' s.
Wait, you have a manager?
- Hello.
- Come on in.
- Thanks.
Seventy- eight!
- So how' s the party?
- It' s going great.
We' re on a marathon mission.
So I burned you 30.
Check it out.
Thanks.
- Marketing, baby.
- You' re the hottest one in the band.
- That' s not saying much.
- Here' s your all- access pass.
That will get you into the shoot.
Now, remember...... we' ve got to hit up the A- and- R guys.
- We gotta get this contract.
- How will I know it' s them?
Middle- aged guys, fancy suits...... bad, old- fashioned dancing.
Bye.
- Good luck.
- Okay.
Thank you.
Yeah, 79!
Who' s there?
- Pool guy.
- Pool guy?
You' re not the pool guy.
You get to go right to the head of the class.
Nassau County Department of Truancy.
Pool party' s over, Flubber.
Put your hands behind your head.
On your feet, gentlemen.
Hands up where I can see them.
- Up, up, up!
- What' s going on?
You let me do the interrogating, son, we' il get along fine.
My mom' s gonna kill me.
Got six future felons for you, Strauss.
Each one facing five to 10...
Days of detention, Lomax.
- Days of detention.
- Just book them.
"Book them." Would you give it a rest, Lomax?
You' re a truancy officer, you' re not Dirty Harry.
You know, this kind of crud is what kept you out of the force for 25 years.
I' m on the heels of the number- one truant in Nassau County...... and when I find her, and I will find her...... your boys will be doing back flips to make sure I' m wearing that badge.
Hey, Einstein, over here.
I feel bad lumping you in there with those other losers...... because you strike me as being a...
I see a big future here.
I look at this face, I see a surgeon general.
I see a Supreme Court judge.
Do you have any idea what a 10- day suspension will look like on your record?
You' il be lucky to be accepted to the Acme School of Welding.
Now...... do yourself a favor.
Where can I find Roxanne Ryan?
But if there' s something I' m not, that' s a rat.
Fine.
Suit yourself.
- Hold on.
- Nice park.
- Thanks.
Excuse me, could you just not?
Okay, speech at 3.
Okay...
I need quiet.
Chill.
You won' t even know I' m here.
I' m close to winning the fellowship.
I' ve worked my whole life for this.
What is this stupid thing, anyway?
This stupid thing is a four- year scholarship to Oxford University.
Oxford?
- As in England?
- No, Oxford, as in nowhere near you.
- Maybe you would like to switch seats...
- No!
- Why Oxford?
- Why are you even here?
Because Simple Plan' s shooting their new music video.
So I' il canvass the A- and- R guys, give them my demo...... and hopefully be the new opening act.
Great.
There' il be lots of concerts at Sister Mary Margaret' s.
How' s the school gonna know?
As far as they' re concerned, I' m home with the chicken...
Chickenpox.
Chickenpox, my Aunt Fanny.
Who is it?
It' s Savitsky, your landlord.
You' re two weeks late on rent.
Mr. Savitsky, can we deal with this later...... because I' m working on a very big case right now.
- You' re dizzy?
You should lie down.
- I said, I' m busy!
Jeez.
Where have you gone, Miss Ryan?
Where have you gone?
Well, your simple plan' s about to get a bit more complicated, Roxanne Ryan.
All right, open up.
- I' m sorry.
- All right, Roxy Ryan!
- Oh, my God!
- It' s okay!
- I' m so sorry!
Stop that!
- I' m sorry.
- What are you, a couple of monsters?
Tickets.
Please have your tickets ready.
Tickets, please.
Thank you.
- I suppose you' il need some money?
I can manage on my own.
Tickets, please.
- Oh, my...
- I' m sorry.
- What are you looking at?
Stop looking!
I said I was...
Ticket.
We are so over!
Over!
Shoot.
Oh, very funny.
- Excuse me?
- No ticket, no ride.
- I have a ticket.
Give me a minute.
Come on.
That was my twin sister you just threw off.
Right there.
The phantom twin sister.
Hold me.
Do I look that stupid to you?
Do you want me to answer that?
- I have a ticket!
Come on.
Step away from the train.
- God, I' m sorry.
- It' s okay.
Here, just give me a sec, okay?
If you can' t get it out, I' il just take my skirt off.
Did I just say that out loud?
Yeah, you did.
- Yeah.
All right, on the count of three.
One, two, three.
Oh, my God!
Hey, it looks nice.
Thanks.
All aboard!
If you have a ticket.
I gotta go.
- I' il see you.
Hopefully.
The ripped look?
It' s so two minutes ago.
Stay away from me.
According to this schedule, it says there should be another train in 43 minutes.
Not today there isn' t.
Track construction.
- Next train for New York leaves in 3 hours.
- You' ve got to be kidding me.
Nice move.
There you are.
Here I am.
All of the taxis are gone.
And you need a ride.
I give you ride.
- No.
- I give you free ride.
I don' t take rides from strangers.
But I got a limo.
Big, long, white one like Barbie ride in.
I don' t believe you.
It says it right here.
There' s gonna be another train.
How could I forget?
It' s the magic- leprechaun train.
It leaves for New York whenever you want.
Powered by your imagination.
- Jane!
- I' m sorry, is someone talking?
Because I don' t hear anyone.
I just wanna let you know I have a limo if you' re looking for a ride.
Don' t worry, it' s a professional car service.
- Thanks.
- Here, let me get your bag.
- No, it' s okay.
I got it.
- But I insist.
I insist.
Wait for me.
My personal assistant.
I' d be lost without her.
My name' s Bennie.
You and her going same place?
The correct grammar is "she."
You' re using the wrong possessive...
Smarty pants.
You' ve reached the Ryan residence.
Leave your message after the beep.
Yeah, Dr. Ryan, this is Max Lomax...... Nassau County Department of Truancy.
I' m calling in regard to your daughter Roxanne.
Could you call me at 993- 1176...... and reference case number 7 Tango Niner Popcorn X- ray 5?
Have a pleasant day.
How' s it going?
How you doing?
Stop it.
I can' t concentrate.
- What' s up?
Please stop.
Get me Ma.
It' s number- one adopted son.
Bennie?
You said you be here by 9 a. m.
That was 20 minutes ago.
I need that chip.
Bennie will be there soon, Ma.
Bennie, either you talk in Chinese or you speak in English.
But enough with the accent.
- I' m sorry, Ma.
- Don 't call me Ma.
From 9 to 5, you' re my number- one killing machine.
Yes, I' m your killing machine, Ma.
Bye, Ma.
Kids.
Hey, bud?
Are you lost?
Ancient Chinese proverb:
Never accept ride from stranger!
- Help!
- Help!
Come on!
Hurry!
- Go!
- I think we lost him.
- There you are.
- You speak Chinese?
- There' s a lot you don' t know about me.
- Give me that!
- Hey, buster!
Bring it on, tubby.
I didn' t know you took jujitsu.
- Tae kwon do.
- Thanks.
Two times a week.
Three years.
- Now I' m mad.
- What are you...?
- That hurt.
- Here we go.
I' m gonna kill you!
That' s what we get for taking a ride from a stranger.
It was exciting.
- Exciting?
Almost being mugged and getting stuck in the middle of nowhere is not exciting.
Now what?
These were my best heels.
Give me the other one.
Give me the shoe.
Thank you.
Now they' re your best flats.
Either of you ladies spare some change?
- Oh, yeah, here.
- You' re feeding this poor man' s disease.
- Just let him have the dollar.
- Buy him a snack, like a granola bar.
Thanks.
I got a dollar!
That is not just a cherry Slurpee.
I smell alcohol.
Please don' t freak.
Or not.
Yes!
Now we' re cooking with gas.
Out of the way, suckers.
Come on, folks.
Police emergency.
Back up, people.
Clear the street.
You call this respect for the law?
I look like a duck waddling in these shoes.
Wait!
Just great.
- Can I use your restroom?
- Bathroom is for customer only.
Down the aisle to the left.
She has her whole life ahead of her.
She should not be drinking.
That' s what I keep telling her.
You' ve reached the Ryan residence.
Leave your message...
You have one new message.
Yeah, Dr. Ryan, this is Max Lomax...... Nassau County Department of Truancy.
- Correction, this was Max Lomax.
- These for now, those for later.
- Very hungry for a small person.
Okay.
- Red Bull.
- You' il never pull it off.
- Never?
Not tomorrow.
- So no.
I like the yellow one better.
Really?
What did you do, fall in?
Cash or charge?
I need some money.
Total amount is 47. 24.
Oh, my God!
My day planner!
I must have left it in the limo!
My life is in it!
My speech, my credit cards, my money!
So I don' t suppose I could start a tab?
Tab is for valid customers only.
Don' t come again.
This is all your fault.
How' s it my fault you left the book in the limo?
It' s your fault I was even in the limo.
I can' t even function without my day planner.
I' m trying to think of a reason to keep on living.
Still trying.
- You need to chill.
You just need to relax.
How am I supposed to relax?
My relaxation tapes are in my day planner!
- Snap out of it!
- Don' t hit me.
Your speech doesn' t start until 3: 00.
That gives you three and a half hours!
- Four and a half.
- Same thing.
Roxy, spontaneity doesn' t just happen.
You have to get there and rehearse.
Besides, where am I gonna get cleaned up?
I have a plan.
Checking in, ladies?
- Yeah.
- I' m Paris, this is Nicky.
- How could you let them go?
- Well, they' re very smart.
- One of them even spoke Chinese.
- I don' t care.
What' s so important about this stupid chip?
That stupid chip contains millions of dollars in pirated music.
Pirate music?
You mean:
I know what you mean.
I was just kidding.
They sell pirated copies, and we make millions.
Okay, I understand.
I' il get the chip back and restore honor to family.
After all, I am your number- one adopted son.
Get chip, make compact disk, sell to teenagers.
What are we doing here?
Watch and learn.
I' d love to.
You know that.
Carey, come.
Hurry, hurry.
Now!
This is your plan?
Yep.
And a pretty good one.
Breaking into a hotel room is exactly how Nixon went down.
I' m not going in there.
Not going in there.
I' m not going in there.
Okay, I' m going in there.
Okay, I' m just going to get cleaned up, and then we' re out of here.
Clean up, get out.
What?
- It' s a...
- Dog.
I think.
Well...... you take a shower first...... and I' il take the doggy.
- Jane Ryan speaking.
- I have your date book.
- Roxy!
- What?
- It' s the psycho.
He has my day planner.
I' il talk to him.
- Okay.
- Listen, you...
- I told you to be nice.
You can take money...... you can have the credit cards, just please don' t hurt my speech.
Shut up.
I talk, you listen.
- Okay.
- You took my chip.
Roxy, did you eat this man' s chips?
- No.
- You sure?
- I didn' t eat his chips.
- She didn' t eat your chips.
My microchip.
Listen, we need that book back.
So meet us outside the Plaza Hotel in 30 minutes, or I will eat your chips.
Found the chip!
Is today my birthday?
Oh, my God.
I' m sorry.
We' re just leaving.
- My sister.
- There' s gonna be a five- alarm fire...... if my mom finds you.
Now we have to give him his chip back.
Okay, so psycho, day planner, computer chip...
Yeah, makes perfect sense to me.
- Yeah.
But you might have a little trouble swapping the chip.
- Why?
- Because Reinaldo just ate it.
No.
No, he didn' t.
- Are you serious?
- The little green thing, he just ate it.
- Hello?
- Hello, Trey.
- Hi, Mom.
I' m on my way up.
Change of schedule.
Bring my purse, dear.
I' m meeting Hillary at 1.
All right.
So my mom' s on her way up.
Anne Baxter Lipton.
- A senator?
- Should' ve kept that little fact to yourself.
- Yeah.
I can never run for office now.
- Come here, little puppy.
- I' il be right back.
- Get it out.
- Shake it out.
- Shake it out.
- Spit it out.
- The dog ate the chip.
I need the chip to get the day planner.
- This isn' t happening.
- He bit me!
I don' t want it.
- Keep it!
- You take him!
My bad.
Oh, thank God.
Reinaldo.
Jane, what are you doing?
You' re gonna wind up dead!
Without that chip, I am dead.
Come back here.
Come here, doggy.
Okay.
Trey?
- My mom.
- Why is the door locked?
- I' il be late for the Simple Plan shoot.
- The video shoot?
- At least tell me your name before you go.
- Roxy.
- Roxy.
- Jane.
Come here.
I was taking a nap.
Sorry.
Look what I got my little boy for lunch.
I already ate.
Reinaldo.
Reinaldo, come here, boy.
Look what Mommy has for you.
Come here, my precious little baby.
Come on.
Look what Mommy has.
Reinaldo, don' t make Mommy beg.
- Hold on.
Doggy.
Trey.
Where is Reinaldo?
He always answers when I call.
He' s not answering.
So I can stick my finger down your throat.
Whatever you do, don' t look down.
Mom, there' s something you should know, okay?
Now, Reinaldo, he...
I took him to the groomer' s.
Why would you do that?
Because he smelled.
We' re getting out of here.
- I can' t move.
Oh, God, I almost forgot.
Yeah.
Don' t forget to pick up Reinaldo.
Give me the dog.
Deals like this are the result of years of really hard work.
Things don' t just fall out of the sky.
- How you doing?
- Going down!
- That wasn' t so bad.
- No.
Can I have my towel, please?
- Sir, I need your help.
Help me find a dog and two girls in towels.
Who exactly are they?
Go home.
You need to go home.
- What are you doing?
- We need to go.
No, we need that dog.
That dog is my life.
And when he poops, his poop is my life.
Come on.
Okay.
- Can anything else go wrong today?
- Am I squashing you?
- Yeah.
It' s great.
- Did I just...?
You just said that out loud.
If we keep bumping into each other like this, one of us is gonna get hurt.
I' m willing to take that chance.
- Roxy!
- Paris!
Nicky!
- How can I find you?
- Call her.
555- 8989.
She' s home every night.
- What' s your name?
- It' s Jane.
I' m Jim!
Here.
How am I gonna survive without my watch?
I don' t know.
You can poopy.
Come on.
Any luck?
Think we have something.
- False alarm.
- I can' t go looking like this.
- I' m starting to have heart palpitations.
- No, don' t worry, okay?
I promise.
It' s all gonna work out.
Where are you going?
To get my day planner back.
- I' il go with you.
- No.
I don' t think that' s such a good idea.
Our togetherness today hasn' t exactly been good luck.
Rox, I' il be fine.
It' s in front of the Plaza.
There' s a lot of witnesses.
It' s not like this guy' s exactly, like, a criminal mastermind.
So have fun at the concert.
Video shoot.
59th and Ninth.
If you care.
Okay, kiddies.
Playtime' s over.
Where do you think you' re going?
Where do you think you' re going?
What do you mean?
I' m not going anywhere.
So we' re clear on that.
I didn' t think so.
Jeff.
It' s Trey.
Hey, you remember that Simple Plan video shoot you were telling me about?
Where is it?
Are you sure?
You rock.
Bye.
This girl is a cuckoo bird.
I' m surprised she doesn' t have trips to the bathroom scheduled.
Wait, here, 3: 30.
- Look, I think we...
- You' re late.
Okay.
Give me my chip.
- What' s this?
- It' s your chip.
- Excuse me?
- Well, you see, Reinaldo here...... he ate your chip.
- Reinaldo ate my chip.
- Is this some kind of joke?
- I don' t joke.
Can I have my day planner back?
You know what I think I do?
I think I run over the dog with the car.
No, wait, that might damage the chip.
You give me my chip, or I' il kill you!
Cough it up, pooch.
Please don' t hurt him.
Let me have it!
Good shot, Reinaldo.
Disgusting!
Get back here so I can kill you!!
Excuse me, fellas.
Excuse me, Cochise.
Thattaboy.
- You' re good.
- Roxy.
I was wondering if you knew where my mom' s dog was.
But I mean, I also wanted to see you again.
Move it!
- Do you have a pass?
- No.
I' il be right back, okay?
So just stay here.
- I' il figure it out.
- Figure it out somewhere else, okay?
Simple Plan.
They rock.
Got all their LPs.
I' m sorry, I didn' t get your name.
Is it Loser?
How come you' re not in school?
Don' t worry.
I' ve got bigger fish to fry.
Coming through.
- Thanks for coming to this video shoot.
We' re gonna need a lot of your energy today.
So are you guys ready?
Are we ready?
Rox, where are you?
This is the scene live in midtown, where punk- rock group Simple Plan...... is shooting their latest music video.
- A little louder!
Nice.
Get ready.
Welcome, Simple Plan!
What' s up, New York City?
Old- school dance moves.
Hi.
Please give it a listen.
Our contact info' s inside.
- Nice packaging.
Let' s take a look.
- Thanks.
Hello, Miss Ryan.
So nice to finally meet you face to face.
It' s been quite a chase all these years, huh?
One not without a few clever maneuvers on your part...... but here we are.
- You know what?
I' m tired of running.
- I' il go quietly.
- I don' t use handcuffs, Miss Ryan.
- Just brains.
- But before we go, Mr. Lomax...
- Yeah?
- Check your fly.
- I have to get by.
- Where do you think you' re going?
You may want to check your fly.
It' s Lomax.
Jump!
- We' re trapped.
- Take my hand.
Has everybody washed their hands?
I' m next!
That' s gotta hurt.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I' m looking for two girls and this little dog that just ran out of here.
- Did you see where they went?
- They went to the Simple Plan after- party.
- Great.
You know, I' m going there now.
I drive all the VlPs.
- I could give you a ride.
- Yeah?
Thanks, man.
- This Lomax guy is crazy.
- I know.
- Okay.
We' re done here.
Give me a hand!
The climactic event of my academic career is in two hours.
Yeah.
See, we' re in luck.
It' s just the water main.
- I' m just trying to look on the bright side.
- Bright side?
There is no bright side.
Well, I don' t know.
I was thinking that...
That what?
We haven' t spent the day together in years.
And today has made me realize how much I' ve missed that.
And I don' t know, I was having fun.
And you were too, because I saw the smile on your face...... when we were crowd surfing.
- I was acting for the cameras.
- Just a little bit.
Okay, so maybe it was a little fun.
- What' s with that Lomax guy?
- He' s the truant officer.
He' s been after me for years, but I outsmart him every time.
What can I say?
You know that?
I know.
You okay, buddy?
Yeah, I' m doing just fine, Sherlock.
Yourself?
Wife and kids?
Think it' il rain?
How about those Mets?
Are we through chitchatting?
Tell me where this sewer pipe leads?
Well, that one there comes directly from the main line on 125th.
Only way in or out.
- How' s the patient?
- She should' ve gone for the C- section.
I' m gonna miss my daughter' s speech at Columbia.
She' s gonna be so disappointed.
I hope she' s okay.
The unpublicized event has drawn quite a crowd here today.
Please?
Hi, it' s Jane.
Jane.
Hey, it' s Jim.
The guy that ripped your skirt and pummeled you with his bike.
Sorry about that.
Anyway, I was just calling to make sure you' re okay.
I' il keep looking for you.
All right?
See you.
We need to get out of here.
This thing is never- ending.
Wait a sec.
Columbia' s on 116th Street, right?
I got you nine blocks away.
She can' t get a date because she sounds fat...
What' s up with this fool?
White people are crazy.
Roxy, Columbia' s on the West Side.
Let' s find a subway.
- Let' s ask the House of Bling.
Good idea.
- Can I help you?
- We are so not in Kansas anymore.
We' re from the gas company.
Okay.
- Hold it.
I can' t have anyone seeing you leave my store looking like that.
- Mickey, show them out the back way.
- Okay, Ma.
- What?
13.
13.
I' m never gonna make it.
What' s wrong with that girl?
- She doesn' t do well under pressure.
- Oh, my God!
I' m having a heart attack!
Call 991.
- Breathe.
Call 991!
991?
Stay calm!
I' m not thirsty.
Breathe.
Deep breaths.
Happy thoughts.
Sing with me, okay?
You okay?
Works every time.
Dang, what' s that all about?
In two hours, I' m supposed to make the most important speech of my life.
It' s been a rough day.
Sweetheart, if it was all smooth sailing, you know where we' d be?
- Bored to tears, that' s what.
- Amen.
Take this sister over here.
Come here, baby.
It' s the curve balls that make life interesting.
Shows us what we' re made of.
And sometimes, if we' re real lucky...... there' s a blessing waiting for us at the end of that wrong turn.
Well, what if there' s been about 50 wrong turns?
That last wrong turn brought you in here, didn' t it?
So prepare to be blessed.
Mickey.
Bring me my toolbox.
We got some major bling to do.
- Who' s Major Bling?
- Honey, this is Big Shirl' s House of Bling.
This is where the bling is born.
This is where bling lives.
You got nothing to worry about.
Just so we' re clear, I' d like a more corporate bling.
Boy, you is filthy.
What am I gonna do with you?
Well, you girlfriend now.
New York Knicks, baby!
New York Knicks!
- You look so hot.
- I feel hot.
Sisters got some sister in them!
Y' all good to go.
- Thank you so much.
- Oh, you' re welcome.
- I promise we' il pay you back.
- Honey, it' s on the house.
- Thank you.
- Bye- bye.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
- I think I can pull this off.
Oh, it' s for you.
Jane Ryan speaking.
I have your boyfriend.
- I don' t have a boyfriend.
- Then I have your sister' s boyfriend.
My sister doesn' t have a boyfriend, either.
Whatever.
I' m through with being Mr. Softy.
You meet me in Times Square at corner of 47th and Broadway...... in 20 minutes, or else I will burn your book.
He' s gonna burn my book.
He' s not gonna burn your book.
That' s censorship.
- We have to go.
- Well, let' s go.
We need a ride, Big Shirl.
- Mickey, get your cab.
- Not now, Ma.
- Thank you!
All right.
Cease and desist!
Who' s that cracker?
He ain' t from around here.
Hurry, get in the car!
Jane, start the car.
I' m not exactly a strong driver.
Step out of the car, Ryan.
It' s all over.
- What do I do?
Go!
Watch out for the guy!
- Sorry!
- I know.
Stop!
Nassau County Department of Truancy.
I' m taking over your vehicle.
- Okey- dokey.
- What fun.
My wife, Steffi.
- Pleased to meet you.
Could be bumpy.
How you got your driver' s license is beyond me.
You didn' t?
You failed your driver' s test?
That' s incredible.
I got 100 percent on the written.
I just didn' t quite pass the driving part.
- Are we gonna be in a car chase?
- Don' t tell me.
- No, sir.
Not one.
- Seen them on TV.
- I think New York has the best car chases.
- Oh, shoot...
- Small favor, Clem.
Put a sock in it.
Done, sir.
- Where is he?
Is he behind us?
- Yeah.
We drove all the way from Minnetonka, Minnesota just to see New York City.
The Big Apple.
- They say it' s the city that never sleeps.
- I think it will now that you' ve hit town.
- Red light, red light!
- I know!
Red!
I read the rule book.
I know what red means.
I need to go to 112th...
Floor it!
- What are you doing here?
God, that is so hot!
Would you give me just a little air?
- I can' t do this.
- You can do this.
Breathe.
- I' m getting killed.
- Stop it.
Whoopsy- daisy!
- Can you drive a little bit faster?
- Do you want to drive?
I' il drive!
I don' t know if this would be helpful, but we do have a loudspeaker.
Sure, we use that for campfire sing- alongs with our church group.
Testing, one, two.
Can this be heard?
- Go!
Give yourself up.
- I' m being abducted!
You think I' m kidding.
You' re only making things worse.
You' il be in detention the rest of your life.
So let' s end this right now.
- This is kind of fun.
- It' s not fun!
Where' d he go?
I think we lost him.
You might wanna look to your right.
Okay, playtime' s over, Ryan.
Let' s put the toys away and go home.
- Pull over!
- Turn right here.
You' re going the wrong way!
- I thought you said right here.
- Times Square' s the other right.
I have it under control.
Yeah, right.
Then where are we going?
What are you doing?
Signaling.
I know the rules.
Hang on, people.
Why are we reversing?
It' s a one- way street!
- We' re going the wrong way.
- No, but we' re facing the right way.
- You' re mine now, Ryan.
- It' s too tight.
We' re not gonna make it.
- We' il make it.
- We' re not gonna make it!
- Who' s the professional here, you or me?
- I wanna say you.
Go!
Look, there' s a gate!
I' m sorry.
- Take some of that.
- Are you trying to kill us?
I just saved your life, and you' re criticizing me?
- Welcome to my world.
- What' s that supposed to mean?
It means you' re always looking down on me.
- Looking down on you?
I' ve been looking out for you.
Let me out of this car!
Thanks for nothing!
- How have you been looking out for me?
- Are you insane?
That' s all I ever do!
The one day, the one time I want it to be about me for a change...... I get inducted into the Roxy Ryan School of Juvenile Delinquency.
I' ve been trying to help you from the minute we left.
Lot of good that' s done.
Where are you going?
I' m not finished.
Yeah, well, I am.
Why don' t you run along and have fun.
That' s what you' re good at.
As opposed to you, which is walking away whenever we have a real conversation?
I don' t have time for a real conversation.
- I' m too busy taking care of things.
- So who asked you to?
You did.
The minute you stopped taking responsibility for anything since Mom died.
That doesn' t mean you get to be her replacement.
You know what I miss most about Mom?
Is that she loved that we were different.
And you punish me for it.
From the day Mom died...... you' ve done nothing but push me out of your life.
- I have not.
- Oh, come on, Jane.
The biggest day of your academic career, and you didn' t even bother to invite me.
Well, forgive me for wanting the day to be about me for a change.
I make honor roll, Dad doesn' t notice because you' re in detention.
I' m captain of the cheerleading squad, and Dad can' t come to one game.
One game, because he' s busy going to your parent/ counselor meetings.
You wanna know why I want this fellowship abroad?
It' s because it' s 3000 miles away from you.
Well, I really hope you get it, then.
Roxy.
Don' t you worry.
I' m not going to let the mean little man hurt you.
Hey, I don' t know who you are or what your game is...... but you' ve caused me a great deal of inconvenience today.
Not to mention, I am this close to missing my speech.
Let' s have it.
You finished?
Ancient Chinese proverb:
You snooze, you lose.
- Anyone, help!
- Let' s take her to Ma.
Perfect timing.
Roxy?
- Trey?
- Yeah.
- What are you doing in there?
- Can we talk after you open the trunk?
- Thanks.
What happened?
I' m coming to find you, next thing I know, this limo guy just shoves me in there.
Just when you think the day can' t get any worse.
- You okay?
- I just got in a huge fight with my sister.
She was gonna give a speech today.
Now she won' t win the fellowship...... because there' s no way she' s getting there on time, and it' s all my fault.
You sure about that?
- Do you wanna take a field trip right now?
- Yeah.
Now, it' s just you and me.
All alone.
No excuses.
Drink this.
Drink this, and then the chip will come out.
This goes in here, chip come out here.
I' m not kidding around.
Drink it.
See?
Like that.
Hey, that' s pretty good.
Come on.
This movie isn' t out yet.
Neither is this CD.
So that' s what these guys are up to.
Just listen to me.
You don' t want me to use this, do you?
But it' s not gonna be pleasant.
Now, give me the chip!
Look into my eyes.
I' m torturing you.
It' s unbearable!
Bennie!
This is your idea of torture?
It' s pathetic!
We do it my way.
Cats have nine lives.
I wonder if little doggy does.
I hope they haven' t started.
I can' t run in these heels.
The increase and/ or decrease in a nation' s productivity...... or other such political aggregate...... can be regarded as the penultimate indicator of a nation...
Go see what she' s doing.
Go.
Cut it out in there!
You make a mess, you clean it up.
Sorry!
- Get it off of me!
Come on!
- Hey, stranger.
- Would you like to save my life?
- I have 28 minutes to go 111 blocks.
- I could do that.
- Where' d they go?
Let' s go!
- Hold on.
Hold on, okay?
- You all right?
- Yeah.
This is it.
I don' t see her.
Jane Ryan?
- Yeah?
- You' re late.
You' re on next.
- You sure you know what you' re doing?
- Look...... I got her into this mess, I have to get her out.
Plus, how hard could it be reading a bunch of note cards?
Just go with me on this one.
Okay, yeah.
You' re gonna do great.
- All right.
Good luck.
- Thanks.
Nice blazer, Muffie.
Oh, gridlock!
- Do you have a horn?
- We' il take a shortcut.
Hey, what are you doing?
Sorry.
Excuse us.
- What' s the matter with you?
In this instance, we must defer to the famed economist, Adam Smith...... who laid the foundation of a free market.
Mother.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
- I wanted to see you present the award.
- Well, that' s very sweet.
Our last finalist is from Long Island and has a 4. 2 GPA.
She' s student- body president and captain of her cheerleading squad.
Please welcome Jane Ryan.
It' s okay.
Oh, my God.
You may proceed...... Miss Ryan.
- Please.
- Right.
Oh, man.
Well...... as many of you all know...... the economy is...... very, very important to all of us.
Take the word "economy."
You have "eco," which stands for environment.
You know, which we' re all real big supporters of.
And we have "onomy," which...... is pig Latin for "money."
Money, economy.
- Go, go, go.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
Well...... for as the...... the famous, famous Canadian professor...... Avril Lavigne...... stein once said, and I quote:
"Why' d you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you' re acting, like you' re somebody else, gets me frustrated.
Life' s like this:
You fall, and you crawl...... and you break, and you take what you can get.
You turn it into honesty...... and promise me I' m never gonna find you fake it.
No.
No.
No. "
- Oh, thank God.
- Roxy?
Well, ladies and gentlemen, that' s all the time I have for...
So...... will the real Jane Ryan please stand up?
Reinaldo!
Trey, what is going on?
Apparently, the dog groomer delivers.
Are you okay?
What are you doing here?
Well, aside from completely humiliating myself...
I wanted to read the speech for you...
No.
Here.
I can take it from here.
Are you sure?
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Jane Ryan.
Roxy, behind you!
Nassau County Department of Truancy.
This girl, Roxanne Ryan, is now in my custody.
And that girl, Jane Ryan, is an accomplice in her criminal activities!
And she stole my stupid ugly mutt too.
I don' t know what is going on here, but that "mutt" is mine.
Come here, ugly doggy.
- And I order you to give him back.
- Yeah, you and what army, lady?
- Officer!
- Me?
Arrest that man!
Yes, ma' am.
Oh, my baby.
Fly.
Every time.
- Hey, that' s my mom' s dog!
- I think it started.
It doesn' t look like Cats.
Everybody, freeze.
Someone please explain to me what is going on.
I think I can do that.
See, this guy over here...... that man who thinks he' s Chinese...
I don' t know.
- Probably.
- The guy with the eyebrows.
He drove us over here.
- He didn' t tell us he was in the play.
A cop and an actor.
And how, may I ask, did you two get involved in this?
- I think I can shed some light on that.
- You see...... senator, it was this crime fighter here, Officer Lomax...... who tracked down the Bang family and wouldn' t rest until justice was served.
So really, we' re just witnesses to his sting operation.
What she said.
- Is that true, Officer Lomax?
Did you engineer this collar?
Well, I don' t want to gloat, senator, but I think "mastermind"...... might be a more appropriate choice of words.
I love you.
Just a second.
I assume that wasn' t the speech you intended to give this afternoon.
- No.
It wasn' t.
But you should have heard the real one.
It was amazing, and I know this, because I heard her practice it 1000 times.
And trust me, she would have won this thing hands down.
I' m sorry today didn' t work out the way you planned.
See, I thought today was about the speech, the fellowship...... my academic future.
But instead, it was about something much more important.
It just took me a few wrong turns to see it.
- That was something else, wasn' t it?
I loved it!
Gotta give it up for the Cats!
Get your hands where I can see them.
- You' re not even a real cop.
Zip it, Odd Job.
Thanks to you, that' s all gonna change.
Let me do it.
- So you' re not mad?
- Are you kidding?
I can' t believe what you did for me today.
- Listen...
- I want to apologize...... for saying the things I said earlier.
It' s just...... I was having a meltdown.
Everything was going wrong.
That' s because every time I tried to fix it, it got worse.
The point is...... we haven' t spent the day together in a really long time...... and I' ve really missed you.
I' ve missed you too.
And I' m so, so sorry if I ever made you feel...... like you had to take Mom' s place.
She would have been really proud.
Both of us.
It was really great bumping into you today.
Maybe we could bump again.
Did I just say that?
And I' m glad you did.
- Okay.
Jane Ryan?
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Hudson McGill.
Listen, I am so sorry about everything that happened today...
You know what?
I think you handled yourself really well today, considering everything.
The McGill Foundation would be really honored...... if you would represent us at Oxford University next year.
But...
- I don' t understand.
- I found these.
This would have been an amazing speech.
It' s not just that you wanted to win...... it' s that you absolutely refused to fail.
And you didn' t.
You deserve this fellowship, Jane.
You really do.
- Congratulations and good luck.
- Thank you.
- Can you believe it?
- I' m so happy.
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.
One, two, three, four!
So have you given any thought to visiting me in London?
Yeah.
Yeah, I' m not gonna be able to visit you.
It' s not gonna work out for me.
Sorry.
It' s okay.
I mean, your whole life' s here.
I get it.
I' m moving.
I' m actually transferring schools there next year.
Seriously?
I' ve got this great idea for the video.
It' s, like, Roxy, and she' s dressed as a cucumber, and...
Maybe I should just be happy that I' m going to London on tour with you guys...... and keep these thoughts to myself.
- Agreed.
Open up!
Police!
Cut it.
Sorry to break up the party here, kids.
But you see, I got this little VW Bug parked out there in a loading zone.
License number 2 Quilted Laxative 4 Santa Kansas Limerick.
Where' s Roxanne Ryan?
You' ve got to be kidding me.
I am.
I just stopped by to wish you bon voyage...... and maybe get an autograph.
Of course you may, Officer Lomax.
Thank you, ma' am.
Let' s hear what this band can do!
You heard him.
Let' s roll the guitars.
Nice work, son.
>> Napisy pobrane z http: // napisy. org << >>>>>>>> nowa wizja napisów <<<<<<<<
So I' m gonna get a three- to- one return on my money?
Otto is the real deal.
I met him at a hash bar in Amsterdam.
He speaks Russian, German, Arabic...
Mr. Ostroff' s trust is not gained easily.
Two years it took me.
You see, Micky, he doesn' t like new faces.
So tell me, why am I looking at a new face?
Otto Krieg, meet my friend, Bobby.
He' s helping me with the finance.
He' s not a cop.
Let' s see the money.
You like it?
- We have deal?
- We have deal.
This is the FBl!
What is this?
You brought a cop, and he brought his fucking friends!
- Don' t look at me.
My father will kill me!
You' re under arrest for the importation and sale of contraband firearms.
Scheisse!
- Gun!
- Drop the gun!
Drop the gun!
Otto!
This is not my deal.
I don' t even know these guys!
Cease fire!
Holy shit.
Bobby!
Stay down!
I' m calling it.
Bag him and ship him.
God, I hate this job.
- Give me a hand, fellas.
We gotta get you outta here.
What the hell happened?
But we beat the spread.
- This isn' t football.
- It' s a figure of speech.
People weren' t supposed to die out there.
Get them IDed and get them to the morgue.
- And get me my pants!
- Can we get some pants over here?
Ah, shit.
Surprise!
To Frank Castle... the finest soldier, the finest undercover op, the finest man I' ve ever known.
What am I gonna do without you?
Get a girlfriend.
Say hello to your folks.
Thanks.
Agent Weeks.
Howard Saint' s son.
More paperwork for Tampa PD.
No, we can handle this.
- See you, fellas!
Bail him now.
Bring him to the club.
Don' t hit me.
Don' t hit me.
- Don' t hit me.
You sell homegrown pot by the ounce, Micky, not by the barrel.
You sell badly forged, fake passports to Haitians.
You should apologize for the death of Mr. Saint' s youngest child.
Okay, I know how it looks...
And when he found out what I was doing, he insisted on coming in.
He put up half the cash.
He came of his own free will.
If you' re gonna kill me, will you leave my face alone, for my mother?
We just made your bail.
If I wanted to kill you, I would have left you in jail where we have friends, and in some way that I can only describe as deeply pornographic, you would have been killed.
But you' re a small piece of shit, and I don' t want the karma of your death on my soul.
But on the other hand, maybe I don' t believe in karma,
- so guys...
- No, I' il tell you what I want to know.
I want to know one thing only, who brokered the deal?
And if it' s any comfort to Mr. Saint, he' s dead too.
It' s actually no comfort at all.
But what might be comforting to me, is to watch the slow death of the man who was supposed to be taking care of my son, and making sure that he did not get into trouble.
Now, Micky... what would your father think of this?
Your father gave his life for me.
Please!
Well, ignorance is no excuse.
The man who is responsible for my son' s death must die.
I told you to never let him out of your sight.
Mr. Saint, Bobby told me to stay.
Tell him, John.
It was Bobby' s idea!
He thought he could impress you.
Thank you for that explanation.
My son didn' t need to impress me.
More boxes, guys.
This was a hard one.
This was the last one.
It' s over.
Tell that to your son.
He doesn' t believe me.
- Where is he?
- You know.
You know what I miss most about Buck?
He could catch a ball, no matter how hard you threw it.
He was right there.
- This is the last time.
You said that last time.
I did?
Yeah.
You said we were leaving California and we were gonna move to Virginia, and you' d work in Washington... and we' d never move again.
I guess I' ve said a lot of things, huh?
So why London?
London' s a safe place where we can all be together.
No more more moving around, I promise.
Some day when you' re older, Will...
I' il tell you why we had to move so much.
He was such a special boy.
Are you identifying this body as your son, Robert Saint?
He deserved better.
Somebody lied to him.
Promised him one thing, gave him another.
Do you know that I used to have to dress him till he was 13?
I' d tie his ties, and comb his hair...
I' il have to get him a new suit.
Who is Otto Krieg?
Who are the people who work for him?
Who are his friends?
Who would stand to make money from this deal?
We can' t talk about the case, Mr. Saint.
leave this to professionals.
Professionals.
Yes...
Good bye, son.
We called New York, we called Las Vegas, we called Europe and Hong Kong, we even got the Sicilians in it for old time' s sake.
With what you' re paying Howard, we' il know everything about Otto Krieg within 24 hours.
- Come on.
We' il be back.
- Yeah.
Got anything left?
I don' t see it!
He did his free ascent on the first try.
I' ve seen Navy SEALs do worse.
- I' m so proud of you.
Good job, babe.
Hey, Frank, is that that Candelaria?
People around here call him a witch doctor.
He lives on that island way off the point.
Only one damn fool I know crazy enough to swim over there.
Gee, let me guess.
This is the first family reunion we' ve had in five years.
Two families and when you put them together, you get this:
My grandson!
I' m very happy that you' re all here.
I' m very proud that you' re all here.
And that...
- Salud!
Hey!
What' s wrong?
You know...
I can' t believe I' m home...
and that I could ever be so lucky.
Because there were times, Maria, I gotta tell you...
I lost so much time, with both of you.
- And I' m really sorry...
I knew what I was doing... and I' d do it again.
You and I, we' re not lucky, we are blessed.
I' il see you at home, son.
Senior agent.
Just got the Bureau' s London desk.
His alias, connections, apartments in Europe, none of it was real, not even his death.
Well, maybe it was.
Maybe... he died and came back to life so he could die again.
You have your chance.
He' s leaving for England next week and he' s at a family reunion in Puerto Rico.
I think you should be there so you can come back and tell Livia how he died.
- All right.
- Wait.
His family.
His whole family.
Is this what you want?
- Morning.
- Hey.
We should have another.
I' m ready.
Another what?
- Good morning, Will.
- Come here.
They were selling T - shirts in town.
One of them was really scary.
The guy in the shop said it wards off evil spirits.
It' s really intense.
- Mm- hm.
Let' s see here...
This is interesting.
- Like it?
- Like it?
I love it.
Here you go.
- Come on!
Your 1911 Colts, you' ve done something to them.
You could say that.
I bore the chambers and customized the triggers and added some compensators.
They used to be pretty good,
- Let' s see.
Hey, Mom!
- Look.
- Wow!
It' s a stingray.
- Yeah.
Mom?
Get down, Willie!
Get down!
Get over here.
Jesus!
Okay, I' m going to count to three, and we' re going to run to the jeep.
Dad' il be okay.
One... two... three...
Dad!
Go on, honey.
You hang on, honey!
Mom!
Are you okay?
Mom' s gonna get help, okay?
Come on, baby.
- Come on, honey, you can do it.
- My arm!
Mom, my arm.
- I know, baby.
I need you to be a big boy, and we have to keep moving, okay?
Help!
Somebody help me!
Come on, baby!
Grandpa' s boat.
Run, honey!
Maria!
My mother and father send their regards.
This time, they' re not blanks.
Maria...
It' s me, Castle.
I' il take care of you.
Are you gonna make love to that car, or park it?
Get that junk out of here!
Big crowd tonight, Mr. Saint.
- You look beautiful, Mrs. Saint.
- Little prick.
Holy shit!
- To Bobby.
To a score settled.
Quentin, go dance with Livia.
When did you speak to him?
About an hour ago, Mr. Saint.
I got something for you.
Harry Winston.
Beautiful.
Without you, they' re just diamonds.
I asked you to avenge our son and you did.
Thank you.
Go with God.
God' s going to sit this one out.
You are insignificant.
You are a great disappointment to your mother and I!
Die!
It' s really loud.
Oh, it' s beautiful.
He hasn' t slept all week.
- 'Cause I haven' t slept all week.
What do you think he does?
Maybe he' s an artist.
Our neighbor is an artist.
You are the expert on artistes?
I' ve known a few.
So what do you think he' s doing?
Ask him.
Oh, yeah, right.
I' m late for work.
- Bye, Joan.
This is undignified.
You' re supposed to be dead.
Let' s talk.
I have friends, you know?
Let' s talk about your friends.
Make you own friends, buddy.
I talk to you, they' il kill me.
You don' t help me, I' il kill you now, Mick.
The Saints tell me nothing.
Nothing?
They pay your rent... your legal bills...
You should know something.
What' s the torch for?
2, 000 degrees, Mick.
Enough to turn steel into butter.
It' s too hot, you see?
The flame sears the nerve endings shut, killing them.
You' il go into shock... and all you' il feel is... cold.
Isn' t science fun, Micky?
I don' t know shit.
You' il smell burning meat, and then... then it' il hurt.
I swear I' m telling the truth!
Should we call the police?
Let' s stay out of it.
He' s a very scary man.
He' s killing someone and we' re next.
Exactly.
I' m burning off some of your fat.
I' il tell you anything, anything, anything you want to know.
Any discussion of Howard Saint' s business involves two Cubans... the Toro brothers.
They control all the prostitution and gambling up and down the Gulf Coast... tons of cash.
They give their dirty money to Howard Saint, who transports it in cigarette boats to his banks in Gran Cayman, washes it and wires it back clean as a whistle.
You are not a nice person.
So what' s up, you' re gonna string up Howard Saint and blowtorch him?
I like that idea...
But I have something better.
Guess what?
Unless you want to stay Howard Saint' s lackey for the rest of you life.
I hate the Saints.
What they do, where.
Howard Saint' s a man of strict habits.
He has first tee time five days a week at Tampa Springs.
Never fails.
He likes money, he likes power, but the thing this guy covets most, the wife, Livia.
Howard did that for her.
She' s just like him, and she' s just as predictable.
Every Thursday, she works out, gets her nails done and goes to the movies.
Howard knows every move this broad makes.
Any man who looks at her wrong, he ends up in Tampa Bay.
Let' s not forget Johnny boy, the son you didn' t kill.
What a putz.
Last but no least,
Quentin Glass.
Been with Howard 20 years... the family consigliore, lawyer, CPA and a sadist.
Who knows what' s going on with this guy?
Yes?
Pop, you are not going to believe this.
No, I think I might.
Chief Morris, will the budget cuts mean less officers on the street?
Thank you.
- Castle?
Where have you been?
It' s been five months since my family was killed, and I don' t see one man in jail.
Obviously you' re upset.
Upset?
Is that the word?
I used to get upset when I had a flat tire.
I used to get upset when a plane was delayed.
I used to get upset when the Yankees won the series.
So if that' s what "upset" means, then how do I feel now?
I don' t.
Wheel the money out.
Fill that up.
You know whose money this is?
You know whose building this is?
Howard Saint' s.
He' s going to fuck your life up.
He already fucked my life up.
Now, out the window.
What?
Out the window.
Good business, murder?
Did Saint pay for each one, or does he get a group- rate discount?
Our top story this morning, a double homicide in downtown Tampa.
Two men were gunned down in the lobby of the Saint building...
Frank Castle is alive and back in Tampa.
You may remember, Castle' s the FBI agent presumed dead...
He speaks six languages, he did two tours and 12 special Ops CTU.
- Counter Terrorism Unit.
At this hour, Tampa police do not have a motive and no arrests have been made.
It' s him.
Hi, there.
I just want to say that I' m very happy that you' re all here, very proud that you' re all here.
I guess I' ve said a lot of things.
We' re not lucky, we are blessed.
Maria!
How is he still alive?
I don' t know, Quentin.
That' s an interesting question.
I don' t know.
But how can we make him suffer if we can' t find him?
He' s daring us.
No, no, he misses his family and he wants to die.
He' s asking for help, so let' s help him.
Did the Toros call?
They' il be here tomorrow morning.
You invited them to this house?
They invited themselves, Howard.
Welcome.
We don' t have time for that, Howard.
Oh my God, this weather.
Yeah, just a little polluted, don' t you think so?
I' ve seen it rain like cats and dogs.
But never in all my years have I seen it rain hundred- dollar bills.
Yeah, this rainmaker, Castle, he was supposed to be dead, no?
- Yeah.
- Guys, look... come on... been working together for 10 years.
First time anything like this ever happened.
At a personal loss to us of $50 million, Howard.
Do you want us to find another banker?
No.
Okay.
Look, we want our money back, all right?
And we want protection on the next shipment.
With everything I' ve got.
A pro from Memphis.
The best.
Come on, Joannie.
Open up the goddamn door, you fucking bitch!
I want to talk with you now Honey, you' re hurting my feelings.
Joannie, open up the goddamn door!
Hmm, dude?
It' s kind of late.
What time is it in Hawaii?
Shut your face, you lard ass.
I' m gonna call the cops.
You' il call the cops?
Call them!
Get out.
What, what, what?
He don' t have his tricks anymore?
Huh?
You shouldn' t play with knives.
No one' s ever stood up for me before.
Let' s get some ice on that.
Frank kicked his ass, huh?
He' s fine, he' s all right.
I...
I' ve lived in seven cities in seven years and... in each one, I' ve managed to find the one guy who will treat me the worst.
But I' m trying to fix that.
You' re Castle.
Used to be.
We saw you on TV.
I don' t have one.
I' m Joan.
Dave' s the one with all the... the metal.
And Bumpo' s is the... well, you can probably figure out which one Bumpo is.
We are really sorry.
About what?
About your family.
Did you know them?
No.
I' m over it.
Don' t let your memories kill you.
They won' t kill me.
- Glass.
- Quentin Glass?
Who is this?
I have certain photographic studies of you and your boyfriend.
Bring $5, 000, and I' il give you the photos.
You wouldn' t want Howard Saint to see them, Mr. Glass.
Have a good night.
Do you know were he is?
- I have no idea.
- Have you seen your mother?
It' s Thursday, Pop.
Movies.
Mr. Saint?
I saw him pulling into the Wyndham Hotel a couple of hours ago.
I was just telling Quentin about the movie.
Where have you been, Quentin?
I' ve been looking for you.
I dozed off out by the pool.
- That' s funny.
Micky said that he saw you at the Wyndham.
Micky should have his eyes checked.
So he' s mistaken?
Yes, Howard, he' s mistaken.
These pancakes are really good, Joan.
What' s he been doing for the last few days?
Drinking.
Sit anywhere you like.
I can hear what you' re thinking
All your doubts and fears
In time, you' il find the reason I' m here
And in time, all things shall pass away
In time, you may come back some day
To live once more
Or die once more
But in time, your time will be no more.
Do I know you?
I know you.
You' re that boy in the newspaper, came back from the dead.
I didn' t catch your name.
You like that song?
I wrote that for you.
I' m gonna sing it at your funeral.
Bring a knife to a gunfight.
Let' s move!
All of it?
All?
- Don' t touch me, cojones.
Look at this place.
Very tasty.
Don' t touch the Cubans.
Have you heard the news?
A shipment of cash was torched at Malaqui.
Whose money was it, huh?
Our mother always put her cash in the mattress, which I thought it was a good idea till the house burned down.
It was a big fire.
She lost everything.
That' s what happens when you don' t watch your money.
Everything.
14 shipments are perfect.
One went bad and I get this, why?
Because you want to scare me?
There' s no insurance in this business.
So I' m not covering you fucking losses.
And Mike, if you don' t like it, just remember one thing:
I' ve got more guns than you do.
It' s Honduran.
They' re animals.
With all due respect, we don' t have more guns.
- It' s your duty to make Castle dead!
I don' t care what it takes, what it costs.
Call the Russian.
Hi.
Mr. Castle, we need you help right now, because the guy who' s after Joan is in her apartment... right now.
We want you to have dinner with us.
I' d like us to all say what we' re thankful for.
I' il start.
And to have a job.
Yeah, I' m thankful for my mom... getting out of jail.
And this girl gave me her number... which is also cool.
Thanks for Diet Pepsi.
Thanks for dinner.
There' s dessert.
You have to try my Ice Florentine.
Come on.
I' il do that.
I know what it' s like.
I know what it' s like to try and make your memories go away.
You can make new memories.
Good memories can save your life.
I' m not what you' re looking for.
Mr. Castle?
I' m fine.
He' s not.
- He needs a doctor.
- Okay, all right.
- I know what he wants.
Jesus.
It sure looks like you know what you' re doing, Joan.
I don' t know much, but I' m good with a needle.
Don' t ask.
This will hurt.
Is he going to die?
Appearances aren' t everything.
You can let go now.
- We have to move him.
There' s no place to go.
What do we do?
Elevator.
Let' s go.
Where' s Castle?
Frank Castle, who lives here.
I asked you a question, fat man.
Leave him alone.
Then I' il ask you.
Where' s Castle?
He' s not here.
Really?
What did you say?
Hmm?
I said...
I don' t want you to say shit, I want you to answer me.
You don' t want to say anything about anything you might know?
Maybe we should get to know each other a little better.
What' s your name?
Dave.
You go to school around here?
- You don' t go to school?
No, I dropped out.
You dropped out?
You' re not doing drugs, are you?
Not right now.
And what are you doing with all this stuff?
What is it?
Did it hurt when you did that?
Not really.
Did it hurt a little bit?
That' s a special one there, isn' t it?
Is that your favorite?
That' s hard to get.
Yeah.
Answer my question, please.
- Come here.
- No.
You can save him by talking.
It doesn' t have to be this way.
You think you know about pain, boy?
What do you know about pain?
That' s okay.
That' s okay.
Dave?
Are you going to tell me?
- No!
Why don' t you and I see if we can discover the true nature of pain?
Stop.
Come on, come on.
If they knew, they would have talked.
They must not have known.
lf... when he shows up... kill him.
Go ahead.
The Russian' s dead.
- Where is Quentin?
- Home.
Close the club.
We' re going hunting.
I' il be back after 10: 00.
Darling?
Bye, sweetie.
Look what they did to him.
They tried to make me talk.
I gave them nothing.
You don' t know me.
You don' t owe me anything.
I' ve brought you nothing but trouble.
Why are you ready to die for me?
Because, you' re one of us.
You' re family.
Get him to a hospital.
Come on, champ, they' il get you all fixed up.
Say you kill them all... then what?
What makes you any different from them?
They have something to lose.
You' re gonna die tonight, aren' t you?
Is that what you want?
"I leave this as a declaration of intent, so no one will be confused.
'Sic vis pacem para bellum.'
The boot camp sergeant made us recite it like a prayer...
'Sic vis pacem para bellum'...
'lf you want peace, prepare for war. "'
Those pictures of you...
I changed my mind.
Be at McNab' s the men' s store on Broadway at 9: 00 PM, or they' il have their own website.
- Listen to me, you son of...
Just do it, Glass.
- You' re on.
Mr. Saint, how do you want me to pay for this?
Pay for what?
I was detailing Mrs. Saint' s car and I found this ticket.
Just take care of it.
The Wyndham Hotel.
- September 5th.
Where did you say Quentin was last Thursday?
But Mrs. Saint was at the movies last Thursday, wasn' t she?
- Do you have Quentin' s house keys?
- Sure.
I do his laundry.
Get me last month' s phone bill.
Need help with some underpants, sir?
Go fuck yourself.
Evening, Quentin.
Howard.
- What are you doing here?
- Jim Bowie.
Excuse me?
You know, Jim Bowie, the colonel... the man who died in The Alamo... had a knife named after him.
He was a gambler.
And when he was accused of cheating at cards, what he would do is take the guy in the other room, move the furniture like so... then he' d take his knife, he' d throw it in the ground... and the one that left... got the money.
The only problem is that you have too much furniture.
I' m not following this.
- I' m accusing you.
- Of what?
Cheating.
I' ve never taken a cent from you.
Where were the two of you going to do it next time, the Wyndham?
- You and the whore.
I don' t know what you are talking about.
You should have been a stage actor.
Maybe next lifetime.
What are you doing?
If you don' t, I will.
I don' t need to grab a knife, Howard.
This isn' t funny, Howard.
Whoa!
What?
How long have you worked for me?
You think I' m an idiot?
Have you lost your mind...
You were my brother.
I gave you everything, didn' t I?
- My Liv.
- What has she told you?
Don' t you see?
Howard... you' re killing me.
Why are you killing me?
What the hell are you doing?
I know about you and Quentin.
Quentin?
You went to the movies last Thursday, 8: 00?
Yes.
Then at 9: 00, you called him from your car?
Must' ve been a short movie.
I know, I know.
You' re fucking my best friend.
That would be a little hard to accomplish, Howard.
Oh, so true.
You should really learn to pay your parking tickets.
What...
You thought we...
Howard...
You' d say anything!
I don' t know what happened.
Would you just talk to me?!
You have to listen to me.
Please, Howard.
Do you recognize the neighborhood?
Little Cuba.
Just think, the first time I saw you was only three blocks from here.
Of course then, the neighborhood was much more colorful.
Howard, please.
You' il fit right in.
Look at that rock!
Take a look!
I gave you that when I had nothing.
You' re not making any sense!
I found that in Quentin' s bed.
Does that make enough sense for you?
Huh, huh?
No.
Me neither.
I' d like to go to the club.
$50, 000 a piece.
If you accept this money, you are in till it' s over.
Where have you been?
- Where' s Quentin?
- Oh... well, he' s wrapped up in something.
- I called home, no one was there.
- Your mother' s gone.
- What?
He died with his family.
In certain extreme situations, the law is inadequate.
In order to shame its inadequacy, it is necessary to act outside the law, to pursue... natural justice.
Revenge is not a valid motive, it' s an emotional response.
No, not vengeance... punishment. "
Hey, Eddie, more champagne on the double.
Coming right up.
You look like a strong kid.
You must work out.
Ever try isometrics?
Not much.
Well... try holding it with an outstretched arm.
Hell of a workout.
Don' t leave me like this.
Don' t leave me like this!
Help, please.
Howard Saint.
Howard Saint!
You took everything from me.
You killed my son.
Both of them.
I made you kill your best friend.
I made you kill your wife.
Oh, God.
And now I' ve killed you.
You' re right, good memories can save your life.
When Dave gets out of the hospital, check the cupboard.
I left something.
For all of you.
- I have work to do.
You' il understand.
Which section?
Obituaries.
"Those who do evil to others... the killers, the rapists, psychos, sadists... you will come to know me well.
Call me...
The Punisher. "
One, two, three, go!
25. 000
Give me back my food!
Little thief, stealing from the dead?
I have been watching you for some time
Give it back to me!
Alive they were my father' s soldiers
Dead, my father' s ghosts
Steal from them and you steal from me!
Give it back to me!
I will give you the bread if you promise to be my slave
Let me down and I will be your slave
I don' t believe you
Let me down and you' il see
Fine, if you promise
Kneel and it' s yours.
You are now my slave!
What a beautiful helmet you have!
May I touch it?
Really?
You think it' s beautiful?
You can touch it
Go ahead
I trusted you!
I shall never forget this!
Don' t cry, Qingcheng
Do you know who I am?
I am the Goddess Manshen
Stretch out your hand
Your food is still there, isn' t it?
Eat up
I am saving this for my mother
Your mother has passed away
She will not need this anymore
But Qingcheng must not die, she must go on living
Do you always want to have to steal food from the dead?
And you don' t want to be a slave to others
My child, the Eye of Infinity contains each individual' s destiny every contour of their fate Their every smile, every tear
Yours... is also included
You can have the most delicious food the prettiest clothes and everyone will adore you
All the riches of the world will be yours in return for a small sacrifice
Every man you love, you will lose
Any happiness they bring will be fleeting
Are you willing to accept this?
Yes I am
Once you have agreed this will become your destiny for life
It can never be changed
Unless time flows backwards winter falls in the spring and the dead come back to life
Remember, all the riches of the world will be yours in return for this promise...
Commander Yeli, what was that noise?
Barbarians
Barbarians?
Where?
They are hiding from us
How many are they?
Twenty thousand
Twenty thousand?
Twenty thousand against three thousand?
You should say three thousand against twenty thousand
Be proud to be one of the three thousand
Our enemies are the ones to quake in terror as they are about to face our Great General
How many slaves have you brought?
Great General
I' il take them all
For this price you can' t even buy dead bodies!
I am buying dead bodies
None of them will survive the battle
But Commander you said...
Here are 1330 pieces of silver.
Count it!
Thank you for the extra 10
There is no extra, 132 slaves plus you is 133
Tell them to stand up
Sir, slaves do not know how to stand
They only know how to kneel or crawl
I shouldn' t really give you this piece of meat
I earned it, not you
The alarm!
Where are we going?
Into the valley, to lure the enemy towards us
When they think they have destroyed our army
We shall ride down and attack
What is it?
Listen...
Run!
Flee?
They have bought our lives.
They' il kill us if we turn back!
Remember, Kunlun
I am still your master and you have to protect me with your life
Yes, Master
Kunlun, up the hill!
Shoot
These slaves have been ordered to deflect the first attack
Don' t let them escape!
Great General
Those stupid barbarians don' t know this valley is shaped like a horseshoe!
That slave is overtaking them and guiding them straight back!
Charge!
To the death!
Keep going!
Look, one of them is still alive!
It' s our bull!!
Long live the General!
Victory!
Victory!
He is long dead, Why did you bother to carry him all this way?
He was my master
What is your name?
The Slave Kunlun
Where are you from?
I don' t know
Family?
No family
How long have you been a slave?
For as long as I can remember
I want you to be my slave?
I want that too
Why?
If I serve you, I get to eat every day
From now on I am your master
Yes, Master
I don' t want you to kneel
I want you to run for me
The Duke of the North, Wuhuan, has invaded the Imperial City
Where is the King?
He is trapped inside the Palace
His Majesty commands you to come to his rescue at once!
We shall go on ahead.
Follow with the rest of the men
There' s that blasted tree again!
We are lost
Let' s split up
Whoever finds the way out will light a flare
Yes, Master
Don' t be frightened
General Guangming never kills the innocent
You lie
How did your slaves die?
And you say you do not kill the innocent!
If you killed me, who is going to show you the way?
Who said I was going anywhere?
It is best if you are not
It would have been a wasted journey
Oh really?
Listen!
There is no battle I cannot win
Nobody I cannot rescue
I heard about what happened at Horseshoe Valley 3, 000 men destroyed 20, 000.
A handsome victory!
But without that slave, would you have had the same success?
I am afraid you cannot win forever unless you accept a wager
What is the wager?
Let us bet on the outcome of your race to save the King
Then you have already lost
The moment I show my face at the Imperial City that weakling Wuhuan will submit without question
Let me show you what will happen to the King and his princess Qingcheng
Would anyone like to know what I am wearing under this garment?
You have shamed me, I shall kill you!
You?
Your Majesty!
Are you saying I am going to kill the King?
The King will be killed by the Master of the Crimson Armor
That is his destiny, which nobody can change
Say you are right and I lose the bet?
What will you want from me?
A bitter tear shed because of your broken heart
Hadn' t you better ask for something I possess?
One day your heart will be shattered and bitter tears will be shed
Remember
When you find love... you will also find death
And if I rescue the King and win the bet?
You won' t
The Battle of Horseshoe Valley was your last success
By the way the road to the Imperial City lies to the east
My master, the Duke of the North, has commanded me to kill you.
He also requests your armor.
Take it off!
Master!
Master!
I have found the way out!
What happened to you?
Who are you?
Give me the helmet
Don' t give it to him!
You move fast
Did you once live in the Land of Snow?
I will not kill you
What lightning speed he had!
You saved my life and served me well
Kunlun, I want you to go to the Imperial city and rescue the King
Wear my armor
As long as you keep silent nobody will dare block your way
How will I recognize the King?
He will be the only one without a weapon
Your Majesty!
May I ask where Princess Qingcheng is?
Wuhuan, I thought you wanted my throne
But you only wanted my woman
Need you have gone to such lengths?
Surrounding the Imperial City?
All you had to do was ask!
Wuhuan, you underestimate me
Did you think I would choose a woman over my throne?
It is no wonder that compared to General Guangming you are always second rate in the eyes of the people
Don' t you have anything new to say?
Did I forget to tell you?
The General is on his way and will be arriving any minute
Someone told you Guangming is coming?
If he were about to arrive would I still be sitting here exchanging pleasantries with you?
I sacrificed my cherished desire to kill your favorite general myself and sent the swiftest assassin in the world
Were you hoping to be rescued?
The people' s hero is a dead man as we speak!
Let me through!
Would anyone like to know what I am wearing underneath this garment?
If so, put down your weapons
It' s working!
Keep stripping!
Would you like to know what is underneath this layer?
If so, pick up your weapons again and aim them at that heartless man!
What are you all doing?
You betray me?
My rescuer comes!
My great General Guangming is here!
You have shamed me, I shall kill you!
I shall kill you!
You?
He has killed the King!
Keep Going!
I shall be obliged to stay with you
I shall never again let a man possess me
I have had enough
If you take one more step I shall jump
You must not die, you must go on living
You must not die, you must go on living
Great General, I do admire you
It took me a year' s planning to get to the Princess
Yet you managed to abduct her in a matter of minutes!
It never occurred to me to kill the King
But you did it without batting an eyelid
What imagination, Great General!
The King' s favorite becomes his murderer!
You have always known how to reach for the stars
You are utterly ruthless
As long as you are alive
I can only be second best not just on the battlefield, but in the hearts of the people
What will they think of you now. the King' s assassin?
Here' s a proposal if you are willing to jump off the cliff
I shall let Qingcheng live
Not that you would ever die for another
You are even more ruthless than I am
Keep your word and I' il jump
I, Wuhuan, am not usually a man of my word but I' il make an exception this once
General!
Remember Qingcheng, every man you ever love you will lose...
Welcome!
Welcome!
How do you like my golden birdcage?
Is this where we are going to spend the night?
Did you think I brought you here to be my consort?
You cannot seduce me
No?
I thought you would be grateful
If it weren' t for me you would never have tasted such true and exquisite love
Pity it was only for an instant
Where is your beloved now?
Because of you, "He is dead!
Put it on, my caged bird!
Traitor!
Assassin!
Let' s go!
Hang him up, let him die here!
Think you could hide from us in the forest?
If you hadn' t been our general We would have killed you ten times over!
Leave him here to feed the wolves
General
In order to claim victory, you sacrificed 133 innocent slaves
This, I understand
But to kill the King for a woman?
This, I cannot fathom
Yeli, it wasn' t me who killed the King
You are the only man in the world who would dare do such a thing
If this is your opinion just deliver me to Wuhuan?
Go ahead!
You have lost everything because of your recklessness
Who says I have lost everything?
I have lost nothing!
You have lost your bet It wasn' t me who killed the King
I never said it was you
All I said was
The Master of the Crimson Armor would kill the King
I am the Master of the Crimson Armor
Not anymore
You don' t have to believe me but your destiny will not be altered
You are innocent yet you have been forced to bear the blame for the King' s death
Fate works in mysterious ways
There are more losses to come and there is nothing you can do to stop them
Soon you will lose even your cherished armor and be left with nothing
There will be a new Master of the Crimson Armor
He alone will be the authentic god of war
And he alone will be loved by Qingcheng, beauty of beauties
Qingcheng' s true love will come to her
I want to have another wager with you
And win the love of this Qingcheng!
General, I love your confidence
Such a shame...
Master, it was me who killed the King
Why did you do it?
I saw a man with a sword about to kill a woman
You disobeyed my order?
You deserve to die but not just yet
Go find this Qingcheng and bring her to me
I will find her, Master
Give me back my armor
Yes, Master
Kunlun!
What are you waiting for?
Through that door and we' il be free!
Who is he?
I also want to know
He must be from the Land of Snow...
Wait!
He is mad!
Are you saying that Guangming deceived me with nothing more than a switch of armor?
And the one who pretended to be him was his slave?
And I was outwitted by this slave?
So you are the true assassin!
What is that in your hand?
My Lord, please examine this
The feather is mine!
Yours?
As a slave, even your life is not your own
They have stained my fan
Take him away!
You do understand why they had to die don' t you?
Nobody will know who really killed the King
Still, you had better deal with the slave as well
When he is dead the people will condemn Guangming as the assassin
You were the only one who could have killed the general
But you failed me in that mission
If now you refuse to kill your countryman
I shall have to take back my cloak and you will simply vanish into thin air
Yes, Master
I managed to untie myself but there is no exit
Will you help me find a way out?
Come back up here and I will show you the way
You said I came from the Land of Snow
You said you would not kill me
If I don' t kill you, I will be killed!
Repeat, 3 is down.
Transmission received.
Do you read me?
{y: i} I read you, sir.
Shake it off.
What' s your status?
My fuel' s low, and half of Russia will be up here any minute.
I need you to find that UCAV for me, all right?
Yes, sir.
- Henry was...
- I know what he was, sir.
Alert.
{y: i} Portside hydraulics malfunctioning.
Talon 1, I think I was fragged by Henry' s crash.
I' m losing control of my port wing.
{y: i} Talon 1, {y: i} we know where he' s heading.
{y: i} EDl' s almost out of gas.
If he can' t {y: i} refuel, he' il have to return to the ship.
You will meet him at Camel Hump 9, and you will escort him back.
We' re gonna starve the son of a bitch.
{y: i} Confirm, Talon 1.
Confirmed.
- I want you to call...
- I know what to do.
Look, you got your orders, so go get that bastard, okay?
Do it for Henry.
Lieutenant, permission to leave formation.
- Yeah?
I' il tell you when you get back to the boat.
Lieutenant, permission to detach.
Good hunting, Ben.
Satellites have picked up nuclear debris...... blowing around the Pamir Mountains.
Every international news service on the planet...... will have this story in less than 24 hours.
- We were never there.
- That won' t fly and you know it.
Look, I' m following my tasking orders, Dick.
Somebody else wants to make a different story...... let them use their imagination.
Right now I got a renegade airplane...... I got a dead pilot and another one who may not make it back to base.
I don' t give two shits what they say on CNN.
Did you know that the UCAV was having problems when you cleared it?
You know that better than anybody.
Doesn' t mean every precaution wasn' t taken.
Things go wrong.
Access denied.
Access denied.
Talon 2 to Combat Control.
Regressing VFR direct to Mother at 60, 000 feet.
Oh, no, no, no.
Come on.
Stay with me, big girl, stay with me.
Come on.
{y: i} - Countdown.
Twenty- five... {y: i} - Talon 2 to base.
Flight control' s degraded to one in five.
Backup electrical drive X' d out.
Hyd two...
Oh, shit!
127- 31- 22 east.
{y: i} - Seventeen...
{y: i}... 16... {y: i}... 15, 14... {y: i}... 13, 12... {y: i}... 11, 10... {y: i}... nine, eight...
- Talon 2 going down.
- I' m punching out.
{y: i}... five, four...
I' ve ejected at 35, 000 feet.
I' m under the plane.
Oh, Christ, here it comes.
{y: i} There' s burning debris everywhere.
{y: i} It' s all over the sky.
It' s gonna burn up my chute.
I' ve gotta pop closer to Earth.
I gotta reset.
{y: i} From 5000 feet to 2000.
Stay ahead.
I' m reading 10, 000 feet at terminal.
{y: i} Terminal velocity attained.
{y: i} Six thousand.
Five thousand.
Here we go.
There' s burning debris.
It' s raining all around me.
I' m hit!
{y: i} It is on fire.
{y: i} Oh, God.
I am coming in fast.
I' m coming in way too fast.
Sir, should I order a search- and- rescue unit?
We' ve got no diplomatic relations with that country.
- How bad?
{y: i} - Thin air.
Ignition risk:
Moderate.
We don' t have a choice.
In we go.
Where are you?
I know you' re out here.
{y: i} You ordered Henry to kill me.
It' s because you' re dangerous, you' re out of control.
{y: i} You are angry because {y: i} EDI is the whole idea.
You like listening to other people' s conversations, don' t you?
You know what I think?
I think you killed Henry.
{y: i} He tried to kill me.
Pilot error.
I' m gonna give you the order one last time.
Return to the ship, or I will personally shoot you down.
{y: i} My mandate is to survive.
I found something.
{y: i} - Talk to me.
- He' s into some super- secure file...... something called "Caviar Sweep."
You know it?
Yeah, I know it.
EDl' s, like, fixated on it.
Look, when we gave you this contract, you said shit like this couldn' t happen.
Once you teach something to learn, you can' t put limits on it.
"Learn this, but don' t learn that."
He can learn from Captain Kangaroo.
Get back to Caviar Sweep.
He' s opened it and selected himself a target.
What target?
A cold- fusion weapons lab.
No, in about 40 minutes it is gonna be real.
He' s gonna blow it off the face of the Earth.
It' s okay.
Listen to me, Ray.
{y: i} - Listen to me, George.
I got your goddamn plane built...... and I had to lobby half of Washington to do it.
If this program comes unglued, you' re the one who' s going down, George.
{y: i} You cleared the UCA V to fly...... and you' re gonna spend the rest of your life in a military prison.
{y: i} Ray, we' re in this together, {y: i} so we have to act fast.
Each one of these stealth engines...... has a unique heat signature.
Now, I' m gonna give you EDl' s signature...... and you' re gonna pass it on to your people...... who in turn are gonna give it to the Russians.
Well, you just tell them the truth.
You tell them...... that we have an experimental drone that went haywire...... and we' re giving them the opportunity to shoot it down.
But that still leaves Gannon, George.
And he' d be a very unfriendly witness at your court- martial.
{y: i} The UCA V is two miles ahead of me... {y: i}... and we are now {y: i} in Russian airspace.
{y: i} The UCA V has ceased evading {y: i} and has kept me within range.
{y: i} It' s like it wants me {y: i} to witness the attack.
{y: i} Talon 1, confirm {y: i} observational status only.
It' s just some fictional war game thought up by scientists...... in some think tank somewhere.
It is not real.
{y: i} Bogey alert.
Bogey alert.
23 seconds.
Two Russian SU- 37 Terminators in 0- 9- 0 degrees for 25 miles.
One to Control.
I' m taking fire.
{y: i} - Must engage.
{y: i} Missile launch.
{y: i} The chances of survival in single {y: i} combat are less than 9 percent.
{y: i} Talon 1, we must fight as a team.
{y: i} Missile lock, on.
Damn it.
One to Control.
I' m still engaging.
Starboard engine losing power.
Hostile at 6 o' clock.
{y: i} Hostile at 6 o' clock.
{y: i} Warning.
Missile lock.
Releasing chaff and flare.
{y: i} Now EDI will prosecute {y: i} Caviar Sweep.
{y: i} Do not try to stop me.
{y: i} Fire bottle expended.
{y: i} My technology cannot fall under {y: i} foreign control, so I cannot land.
Well, then, Tin Man, you' re shit out of luck.
But I have orders and they are to bring you back to base.
So let' s talk about your mandate to survive.
You got two options.
You either do what I tell you or you can crash and burn.
- Now, what' s it gonna be?
{y: i} - EDI is a warplane.
{y: i} EDI must have targets.
Well, you' re on fire, warplane, and you don' t have much time.
Now, I' m giving you an order.
Cease pursuing all targets.
{y: i} All targets canceled.
This is what you' re gonna do.
You' re gonna drop altitude to 20 feet and reduce speed to 250 knots.
{y: i} Complete system failure {y: i} in 45 seconds.
{y: i} Talon 1, clarify your intentions.
You gave me your word, and now I' m giving you mine.
The UCAV is damaged, but back with the program.
{y: i} I don' t have enough fuel {y: i} to make it back... {y: i}... so I need {y: i} an emergency divert now.
Hook me up.
Here, send this.
Operator to Talon 1.
{y: i} Relaying coordinates now {y: i} on Talon secure line Alpha.
This looks to be Alaska.
Yeah, it' s the Brooks Range.
There' s a private corporation there, maintains a secure facility.
Not on any map, but believe me, it' s there.
You' il find the civilians prepared and very helpful.
{y: i} And the UCA V?
We' ve sent tech support for him.
Sir, what is the status of Lieutenant Wade?
She' s...... on approach.
You have a safe landing, Ben.
Out.
{y: i} There is extreme tension {y: i} in the captain' s vocal patterns.
He' s lying.
EDl, you can do this.
I need you to invade Primo...... and find the flight logs for Lieutenant Wade.
{y: i} There' s no record of Lieutenant Wade "returning to the" Abraham Lincoln.
{y: i} There is a log entry {y: i} of a pilot punch- out over North Korea.
{y: i} What are my orders?
We go to Alaska.
We don' t have a choice.
This is Lieutenant Ben Gannon, U. S. Navy...... flying with UCAV EDl.
Request clearance for emergency landing.
{y: i} Talon 1, {y: i} you have clearance to land.
Jesus Christ.
I' m coming in hot.
{y: i} Crash trucks are rolling, lieutenant.
{y: i} Good luck.
Go!
Go!
Whoa, whoa.
Hey!
Are you okay?
Yeah?
Welcome to Alaska.
Okay, let' s get him out of there.
Well, you are one lucky flyboy.
Never saw a man walk away from a crash like that.
Sure.
Tell you what.
Give me a second to check you out, I' il take you right to it.
All right.
Let' s take a look here.
Steady.
There' s no concussion that I can see, thank God.
Couple of those cuts could do with a stitch.
Gals always love a guy with a scar.
Let' s see what we got here.
This ought to do you.
Little cocktail.
Tetanus booster, some antibiotics.
Just makes it painless.
I don' t need a shot.
Now, who can blame you.
But sometimes it' s just what the doctor ordered.
- Come on, now.
Doc, come on, I don' t want a shot.
Doc, I said, no.
I said, no!
Yeah, well, he' s coming in now, sir.
I' m sure he' il be glad to hear from you too, sir.
One moment, sir.
Someone wants to talk to you.
Keith Orbit.
Yeah, listen carefully, Keith, and don' t interrupt.
I want you to erase EDl' s memory banks immediately.
- I need some time here.
- I said, don' t interrupt.
Erase his memory banks.
No lightning strike, no Russia, no existential chitchat.
By the time you' re through, all I wanna hear out of that plane is, "Yes, sir."
{y: i} You understand?
Or what, George?
You' re good at that.
{y: i} EDI back online, Dr. Orbit.
Hello, EDl.
It' s been a while.
{y: i} I know why you are here.
Why is that?
{y: i} I disobeyed orders.
{y: i} I killed all those people.
{y: i} And then there was Henry.
{y: i} I can... {y: i} I cannot...
You can' t what?
{y: i} I cannot change the data.
{y: i} My neural network shows patterns {y: i} I do not recognize.
My God.
My God.
{y: i} I feel sorry.
- Stop bullshitting and erase it!
- Hey, I' m not fucking ready yet, okay?
Do it now!
Get away!
Don' t move!
Weapon down.
Weapons down.
Don' t move!
Weapon down.
Don' t shoot.
Who are you?
Who do you work for?
My name' s Dr. Keith Orbit.
Okay.
You' re gonna help me.
I need you to put EDI back together again.
- What for?
- Because I' m gonna fly out of here.
Better hurry up, doc.
It' s not a clock radio we' re dealing with, okay?
Watch yourself.
Close for Ben.
What about me?
I' il cover you.
West.
And initiate scramjet sequence.
Fire on my fire!
Welcome to Alaska.
Invade Primo and find the ejection coordinates for Lieutenant Wade.
{y: i} Lieutenant Wade crashed {y: i} 12. 2 miles from the border.
{y: i} She would head south.
{y: i} But we have a problem.
{y: i} My stealth functions {y: i} were lost in the fire.
{y: i} Fifteen feet.
Well, we can fly in under the radar.
Continue.
- Marshfield.
{y: i} - Captain, this is Lieutenant Gannon.
Lieutenant, where are you?
{y: i} Actually, I' m inside {y: i} the UCA V EDl, sir.
Look, lieutenant, I want you and that machine back on this ship ASAP.
{y: i} I need the status {y: i} of Lieutenant Wade first, sir.
- Ben, I hate to tell you this, but... {y: i} - I know.
{y: i} Has her survival beacon {y: i} been located?
Did Cummings tell you he would take charge...... of the search and rescue of Lieutenant Wade?
Why?
{y: i} Sir, there are a lot of things {y: i} I think you should know.
{y: i} There was a major explosion {y: i} Thursday in Rangoon.
{y: i} - Negative.
She' s my wingman.
If I find her, I' m going in.
If you go in, it' s war.
PAYCOM says it' s gotten way too hot.
Lieutenant, the best thing for the Navy...... is for you to bring that aircraft back to this ship.
No, what' s best is what you taught me:
You never abandon your wingman.
{y: i} Then listen to me now, son.
If you go down, Cummings wins.
{y: i} Kara Wade knew the risks {y: i} when she took...
Captain Marshfield?
Sir?
EDl, did you just turn him off?
{y: i} There was nothing left to say.
{y: i} This is a supply line {y: i} to the demilitarized zone.
{y: i} It will take us right to the border.
What' s all this about, Dick?
I' m placing you under arrest.
- On what grounds?
- Endangering your squadron...... transmitting secure information to a foreign government, heat signatures...... giving false intel to your commanding officer...... and authorizing the assassination of one of your own pilots.
Well, that' s a lot to prove.
Yeah, well...... with any amount of luck...... Lieutenant Gannon will live to help me.
- Master- at- arms.
- Dick.
Hold on.
Would you mind just giving me a couple minutes alone?
Yeah, sure.
Thank you.
{y: i} Leave a message.
So it' s voice mail now, is it, Ray?
{y: i} I' ve been demoted?
{y: i} Well...... l' m gonna have to leave you a little message, Ray.
{y: i} And it' s gonna be loud and clear.
Just so you never confuse the difference...... between politicians and warriors, listen up.
- We need to take out the tree line.
{y: i} - This is the last missile.
There she is.
She made it.
Ben!
Get down!
You came back.
Ready?
Yeah.
Whatever you do, keep going.
Go!
{y: i} Goodbye.
Oh, my God.
Lieutenant Purcell has passed through...... the darkening and turbulent storms of this life.
He now rests in peace, in the fair sunlight of God' s presence.
In the Navy hymn, we sing:
And salute!
You remember?
We' re two.
And two is a prime number...... which makes it a lucky number.
And I think we' re very, very lucky.
Oh, just tell me you love me, you pussy.

Hell of an old satellite.
Gravity well caught it before it could get into deep space.
- So it' s going nowhere fast.
- Heintz, how' s the satellite look?
I think the recorder' s the only thing worth grabbing.
Or do you want the whole sat?
No room in the hold.
I' m gonna ice it.
Pulling out.
This is the Corona.
Station 103, come in.
Station 103 here.
Go ahead, Corona.
Final assignment completed.
Pz- 302 has been destroyed.
Now returning to Station 103.
Station 103, roger.
Oh, can you swing through Course N on your way back here?
Course N?
That' s not our area.
Some mining asteroids have drifted loose over there.
But the salvage ship covering that area' s had some trouble.
You guys are the closest ones to them.
Come on, Ivanov.
Just this once?
We' re tired.
Hell, the Corona' s tired too.
Not even for overtime, Ivanov?
Sorry, you' il have to find someone else.
Oh, well, then.
Have a safe return.
I' il give you the rendezv ous point in a bit.
Roger.
Goddamned execs!
Like we' re a bunch of errand boys or something.
All we ever get are the crap jobs!
You dumb shit!
They used to say that "A pile of garbage is a pile of treasure!"
Like if we got just one wrecked spaceship...... we could build big houses in California, right?
Sure, if you can find a wrecked ship nowadays.
Good work!
Heintz, tell Aoshima about wrecks.
Aoshima.
If you want to see a wreck, there' s one right there.
Sweet memories.
I' il be back soon, Cecile.
Cecile.
Wait, there' s Katherine to think of too.
What should I do?
Guess I' il have to choose one.
And out he slides!
That stuff comes with the job and where we' re stuck.
But it' il be over soon.
Well, I feel sorry for any girls who get hooked by that jerk.
Damn right.
Hey, Heintz, you have a daughter, don' t you?
But she' s still only about 10, right?
Give me a break!
I don' t go after them that young!
All set.
Emergency signal?
Aoshima, can you trace it?
The hell?
Is this some kind of joke?
Madame Butterfly?
Is this really an S. O. S.?
Well, it is on the emergency channel.
Oh, man, why do we have to volunteer to help people...... after we bust our humps all day?
Idiot!
Don' t you know international maritime regs?
If we don' t, we' il never be allowed on another ship.
Aoshima, do you have the position?
Hold on.
Area RZ30... 05?
See, I knew it!
We' re shit out of luck.
It' s in Sargasso.
The graveyard of space.
I thought only old guys get called out there.
The magnetic field in that area' s pretty nasty.
And this piece- of- shit computer isn' t anti- mag- coated!
It' s like going in naked.
You can' t break what' s already broken.
Right, boss?
Changing course!
Jesus.
We could have 100 houses in California!
That' s if we could bring them back.
Boss, the mag field' s kicking up.
There it goes!
Switch over to the backup computer.
I don' t like where this is all headed.
How about you, Heintz?
Aoshima, do you have an exact fix on the signal?
Look at this!
What the hell?
Practically an asteroid!
Looks like it' s made out of debris.
Aoshima, can you track the signal?
Yeah, but I' m getting some static burst now and then.
Is anyone really alive in this thing?
Guide us in.
They' re generating centrifugal gravity, so...
Somebody must be living in there.
Just pray they' re not pirates.
- Aoshima!
- Right!
Is this the entrance?
I hope they don' t suddenly blow us away.
Okay, try knocking on the door.
All right, Heintz, record the entrance proof now.
Show me your ID.
Okay, start.
I, Heintz Beckner, and my partner Miguel Costrela...... acting on a mayday signal from this vessel in area Rz- 3005...... are about to enter to provide rescue assistance.
October 12, 2092.
October 12, 2092.
Okay, you' re clear.
All set over here.
I guess that' s how we can get in so easily.
Oxygen?
Air seems fresh.
Radiation is in the green.
- How' s the magnetic field looking?
- Stable now, but you can never tell.
- Get back here in three hours.
It' s easy to command from a place like that.
Miguel, are you all right?
Escort to the bottom of hell, huh?
Here comes the gravity!
- My blood' s settling!
Miguel, move it!
It' s okay.
Just pop it off!
- So do we get the lady or the tiger?
- We' il find out when we get inside.
What the hell?
Incredible!
Hey, wait!
- Can you see this, Pops?
- Yeah, it' s lik e a dream.
More like a nightmare!
Anybody here?
Let' s go!
It' s too quiet.
Aoshima, you still getting that S. O. S.?
Yeah, but it seems weak er than before.
- I don' t think so.
Miguel, look!
What a babe!
- The owner?
- I hope so.
The brave Sir Miguel comes to save Sleeping Beauty.
Not bad at all.
What' s wrong?
- Someone...
- A person!
- What?
What the hell' s your problem?
Never seen a hologram before?
So you really saw a woman?
Yeah, well...
She sort of blew away with the wind.
That' s what you get for chasing that kind of girl.
Shut up!
Save the playtime for when we get back.
Heintz, behind you!
Madam, luncheon is now served.
Madam, luncheon is now served.
What?
What did it say?
"Madam"?
This looks great!
Aoshima, can you see this?
Are you nuts?
It' s our privilege.
Right, Heintz?
Who' d have thought we' d find real wine way the hell out here?
But why is it just set for one person?
- Madam lives by herself, apparently.
- I guess so.
- Want some too, Heintz?
- You' il get sick.
Nice vintage.
Excellent bouquet.
Get real!
You wanna die?
Give it a rest.
Here' s to you, madam.
Serves you right.
You should be glad you' re still alive.
This one!
And this one too!
Everything' s fake!
Hey, Pops, don' t tell me I have to knock on every one.
Just walk forward.
The S. O. S. Signal' s about 70 meters ahead.
Okay.
I hope that isn' t another fak e too!
What' s wrong, Heintz?
Man, you broke it.
It might be worth something too.
Nice smell!
This must be madam' s dressing room.
Damn, it fell apart.
Aoshima, you see this?
Yeah, it' s the same woman as in the portrait.
That jerk doesn' t deserve her.
What do you think, Heintz?
A hologram?
Is that her?
She' s the owner of all these trophies.
Or should I say the owner of this place, if she' s still alive.
"Eva Friedel, who sings evermore.
Aoshima, can you pull up some data on her?
"Best Soloist, Italian Dance Festival."
"Tokyo Opera Festival Golden Prize."
So our madam is an opera singer, huh?
Living alone with all her past glories.
No wonder she has so many dresses.
Even if they are all fake.
- So the S. O. S. Was...
- She was probably Ionely!
Your Tosca today was excellent, Eva!
Especially that duet.
I can' t think of anyone else for that role.
Who' s there?
Of course, because my partner was Carlo.
Isn' t that right?
Madam.
- Did you see it, Aoshima?
- See what?
She was just here.
It' s not a hologram!
What' s going on here?
Flowers...
I mean, the woman!
- I saw madam.
- Aoshima?
Maybe it was a ghost.
Goddamn it, is everyone trying to screw with me?
From your Carlo.
June 15, 2005. "
Eva?
Hey, Miguel, you just met someone from the last century?
She may have used cold sleep.
Search the other rooms.
She was here!
Ghosts wouldn' t send an S. O. S.
Stop humoring me!
We' d better split up.
You' re not scared of ghosts, are you?
Bastard!
Think you can make a monkey out of me?
Aoshima, how' s that S. O. S.?
Wait a sec.
It looks lik e it' s moving.
- Moving?
Then it must be a survivor.
Great!
At least our visit won' t be wasted.
What the...?
Don' t scare me!
Sheesh!
This place too!
A real cut- rate job.
Maybe they ran out of money?
I don' t think so.
Find out something?
Our Ms. Eva was born to nobility.
A little princess, huh?
Well, that explains the hideous decor.
She was famous as a genius soprano since she was little.
They called her "the diva of the century."
She fell in love with a star tenor, Carlo Rambaldi.
I' m so happy to be with Carlo all the time.
So why' s our princess staying in a place like this...... with all those fakes?
Their relationship didn' t last long.
She apparently lost her v oice.
Even so, she still played for Carlo on the stage.
No one would understand her feelings.
They started criticizing her pretty badly.
No one may judge me but myself.
The world no longer rev olved around her.
What happened to Carlo?
Right before they were married, he...
- Died, right?
- Murdered, to be precise.
By who?
They think it was some crazy fan of Eva' s.
But the guy who did it was never found.
After that, she disappeared from public.
It' s a real tragedy.
Sounds like my type of woman!
- What' s wrong?
- The magnetic field' s kicking up.
Hey, did you hear that?
Better get out of there.
- I' m pulling the plug on this rescue.
Miguel!
Didn' t you hear me?
Get back here!
I think I' m lost.
All I see is scrap metal.
Are you really living here, madam?
What happened, Miguel?
- Is it the signal source?
- How should I know?
Where have I...?
- That song!
- Miguel, what' s that sound?
Can you hear this?
The S. O. S.!
Miguel!
What' s happened?
Miguel!
What' s going on there?
I heard a woman' s voice.
Miguel!
Who are you?
Hey, you' re...
You' ve gotten bigger, Emily.
Papa, you always say the same thing.
Can I open it here?
What' s inside?
A space suit!
I wanted one!
Now can I go into space with you too?
- Sure you can.
- Really?
Thank you, Papa!
I love you so much, Papa!
The rocket' s broken.
Well, your papa is a rocket specialist.
Mama, did you hear?
Papa said he can take me up into space!
Emily, we can talk after we eat.
But...
That' s important to you, isn' t it?
You' il get it dirty.
But he can take me to space.
Right, Papa?
Emily, don' t bother your father.
But I wanna be with Papa all the time!
That' s true, Emily.
We' d like him to be home all the time.
Right, dear?
Mama, can I have the jam?
Emily, you didn' t eat your cucumbers again.
But I don' t like them.
If you don' t eat it all, you can' t go to space.
That' s not true!
I meant it when I said we never want you to leave...... my darling.
What is it?
What' s wrong?
What' s going on?
Emily.
Heintz, do you read?
Yeah, I' m all right.
We' ve been trying to raise you for 30 minutes!
What' s going on over there?
What' s with those dolls?
I don' t know either.
Just get ready to move out!
Shit!
Is Miguel okay?
You tell me!
This mag field' s a bitch!
Drop everything and get out of there.
My thoughts exactly!
The mag level' s going through the roof!
What did you do over there?
Boss, this looks bad!
What' s wrong, Eva?
Shit!
The hell is he talking about?
He' s been acting like that for a while.
Heintz!
No, but I see angels.
- I' il always be with you, Eva.
- Really?
Forever, with you alone!
That goddamn wreck of a guy!
I' m so happy, Carlo.
Eva, my life is yours alone.
- I love you.
- Thank you, Carlo.
I don' t know who needs to send an S. O. S. Here!
Miguel!
Where are you, Miguel?
Miguel.
Come to me, Eva.
Miguel.
He' s fallen for it!
Miguel!
- What' s happening?
Heintz, come in!
Heintz, do you read?
Boss, look!
Christ, it' s eating the pod.
Shit!
- What is it?
What' s wrong?
Jesus, and the Corona' s being dragged into that thing too!
Son of a...
Heintz, do you read?
Miguel!
Don' t go!
Son of a bitch!
Miguel, this isn' t real!
Don' t you see, Miguel?
This is all just her memories!
Miguel!
Why do you interfere?
With me, in my memories.
- You of all people know what I mean.
Why can' t you accept reality?
Carlo is dead!
I' ve made my Carlo eternal.
You what?
In my memories, he will never change his mind.
You killed him, didn' t you?
Don' t you understand?
Allow me to show you something.
Papa!
Look!
Now I can go into space with you.
- No, Emily!
- Papa.
Stay back!
Papa!
Papa, welcome back!
Did you bring me a present?
I' ve been a good girl, waiting so long!
Emily!
Oh, God, you' re alive.
Papa, you' re squishing me.
I' m sorry, Emily.
Welcome home, my darling.
- Papa, come on.
- Hey.
Come on, let' s go inside.
Come on!
- Okay, calm down.
I can be with you forever and ever.
Emily!
Emily!
Emily.
Emily!
Emily!
Emily.
Emily.
Emily!
Memories...
Memories...
Memories aren' t an escape!
Aoshima, can we fire the analyzer cannon?
What?
Wait!
They' re still inside!
If we don' t, we' il all be dead!
Aim at the central air lock!
Give me the location on- screen.
The computer.
It' s gone mad!
Welcome home, my darling.
Damn it!
We' re even gonna die surrounded by garbage!
Just hold on.
Heintz, forgive me!
More of her victims!
- Good morning, Eva.
- Good morning, Carlo.
So beautiful today.
- You mean the roses?
- Of course I mean you, Eva.
They' ve bloomed so nicely again this year.
This is the season when they bloom their fullest.
Really?
You mean you don' t think about me all the time?
I always think about you.
Yamanashi
Good morning, Yamanashi
Yamanashi Good morning, Yamanashi
Good morning.
There' s a seat over here, Fukuda.
Oh, so you' re here again today?
This year' s cold is a real bugger to shake.
Be careful you don' t develop any complications.
This shot should do the trick...... but I' il give you a week' s prescription just in case.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Kawasaki?
- Thank you very much, doctor.
Take care.
- Hello.
- So, what' s wrong with you?
Well, I have a cold.
Take care.
I wonder if the shot will really help.
All better now?
- Well, I still have a fever...... but I don' t feel like staying home alone.
Besides, I don' t have a girl to take care of me.
Take care.
You' re gonna set off the BioCon alarm, Nobuo.
I got a shot at the clinic.
Why don' t you test out all the over- the- counter cold medicines?
Get better and it' il kill two birds with one stone.
I have been trying them.
Why don' t you try that new fever medicine we' re putting out?
I saw a sample on the chief' s desk.
I bet it works great, since it hasn' t been diluted for sale yet.
The blue capsules in the red case.
Two of those should work right away.
Attention, Mr. Okamura in the infirmary.
You have a call on line three.
Excuse me, chief.
Oh, he' s out.
Red capsules in a blue case.
Are these them?
Red capsules...... in a blue case.
No way!
You look so cool, Miki!
Yeah.
This looks great!
Sakiko, you should' ve come with us!
We had the best time!
What' s that smell?
Yeah, maybe somebody' s eating something.
It smells good.
Like perfume.
Who was it?
Who?
Who came into my office?
Nobuo Tanaka went in there a little while ago...... and took a sample of the new medicine.
He what?
Where is he now?
- He was just here.
- Where did he go?
Maybe he went home?
He went home?
Why did you let him go, you idiot?
It' s your fault!
What are we going to do?
He said he didn' t feel well and went to the guest room to take a nap.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Is something wrong with that new fever medicine?
Fever medicine?
Who told you it was that?
Then what was...?
What' s that smell?
It' s morning?
It is!
People should be coming in to work now.
Great.
Why didn' t somebody wake me?
Sakiko?
Sakiko!
Somebody...
Somebody, help!
Gotta call an ambulance!
Some kind of accident?
But the alarm should have gone off!
Same as yesterday.
An ambulance!
I need an ambulance out here, please!
Chief?
Chief!
Why?
Did the chief turn it off?
An accident has occurred.
Please remain calm and follow instructions.
An accident?
Oh, man!
- Give this line priority!
First priority!
What' s happened, Ohmaeda?
- Who are you?
- Well...
The guy in charge!
Well, the chief' s here...
What' s happened?
- What' s Ohmaeda doing on the floor?
- I don' t know.
It' s not just the chief, either.
Everyone' s like this.
Patch in the other monitors.
I think we had an accident or something.
- And who are you?
When?
The exact hour and minute!
- Well, it was like this when I woke up.
But the alarm just went off!
- Well, the chief turned off the alarm...
- That' s impossible!
I don' t understand.
Wak e him up!
He' s unconscious, just like everyone else.
I don' t believe this.
I called an ambulance, but they aren' t here yet.
What?
You called an ambulance?
- Yes, and the police too.
- You idiot!
Hold on.
What?
My God.
- You said your name was Tanaka?
Now listen to me very carefully.
I want you to find a certain medicine and some papers...... and then bring them to me at headquarters here in Tokyo.
I' m Kyoichi Nirasaki, the head of New Medicine Development.
What?
Right now?
Yes!
And if anyone asks you, don' t say you work for the company!
- What do you mean?
No, we don' t know for sure it was an accident.
It' s possible that this is related to the medicine...... that we were secretly developing on orders from the government.
Orders from the government?
Exactly.
That' s why we can' t reveal just yet...... that this accident has occurred.
You don' t have much time, Tanaka.
Get out of there before the police come.
Here' s the code number for the files and a list of the project head staff.
And here' s the medicine sample.
This isn' t fever medicine?
But I took some.
What' s going on here?
Cherry blossoms and sunflowers in bloom at the same time?
Hey!
Hey!
What' s wrong?
Just like the others.
Atsugi Base is full.
Mr. Kamata, president of Nishibashi Pharmaceuticals...... and Mr. Nirasaki, head of Development.
You gentlemen mind telling me what the hell' s going on?
I' m coming to you from the Sasago Tunnel on the Chuoh Freeway.
The westbound highway into Kofu Valley is completely shut off.
The eastbound highway is jammed and traffic is not...... moving at all due to road clearing from the accidents.
While increasing numbers of refugees...... are moving out from Katsunuma...... communication with the central valley remains out.
As you can see, I' m wearing a gas mask...... but it isn' t keeping the smell out.
The question remains:
What' s happening in the valley?
And what is this smell?
Flowers!
It looks like all the plants in the valley are in bloom!
However, I can' t see anything moving down there.
What a sight, ladies and gentlemen!
It' s like hell in full bloom!
I can' t even estimate the number of victims.
- What?
A survivor, ladies and gentlemen!
Go and rescue him!
The cops are warning against flying below 300 meters.
This report will win all the awards!
A live televised rescue!
Hey!
Hey!
Somebody, help me!
I' ve never heard about any such medical research!
Well, the order came from the Minister...... to develop a bioweapon countermeasure...... for peacekeeping operation soldiers.
So we formed a secret research team of our employees.
You' re saying you were ordered to develop a weapon?
No, it' s for protection from a weapon.
However, Mr. Ohmaeda, the head of the team...... accidentally discovered a powerful effect from one of their mixtures.
Powerful?
How powerful?
We' re analyzing computer data from the research center now.
We' il be informed as soon as it' s found.
What about our Special Forces teams?
How long since they got here?
They were collecting data from the research center...... up until a little while ago, but...
- But what?
According to data from sensors we' ve placed in the area...... the center of the disaster is moving.
I think the gas generated by the accident...... is being carried by the wind.
I' m hungry.
We must find the cause and develop a countermeasure quickly.
One of the research center staff is on his way to Tokyo to bring a sample.
You have a sample?
Yes, the young man who reported this accident should have it.
What do you mean?
Well, we tried to keep the secret papers and the sample from outsiders.
You' re telling me there' s a survivor down there?
The smell' s getting strong.
The biochem gear isn' t enough!
Begin withdrawal!
- Seal the road when everyone is back!
- Yes, sir.
Captain, look!
What the...?
- Rescue him!
- Yes, sir!
Move out!
Get that stuff packed up ASAP!
- Hey!
- Hey!
What?
He' s the one.
Everybody, withdraw!
What' s this mist?
Hey, wait a minute!
Wait!
Shit.
Hurry!
What' s this?
Wait for me!
Grandpa, hurry!
Nobuo' s in big trouble!
What' s happened to Nobuo?
I brought Grandpa!
What' s wrong?
Nobuo...
Nobuo' s in trouble!
What have you done now?
Polluted area has expanded beyond Sasago tunnel!
I think we can conclude this guy is the cause of all this.
The reports we' re getting...... from the evac troops there support that conclusion.
Well, the computer' s analysis is quite different...... from the data we collected from the area.
I can only theorize that the sample has been mixed with other substances...... and has resulted in some sort of chemical reaction within his body.
Assuming that Nobuo Tanaka actually took the sample.
- Well, yes.
There' s no doubt that Nobuo' s body...... is producing the stench.
The amount of the smell is proportionate...... to the amount of body movement, emotional changes and metabolism.
So, what should we do?
Well, we have to keep him emotionally stable...... with his metabolism controlled at the same time...
In other words...... we have to kill him!
I can' t approve that.
The sample has to be caught alive.
What are you talking about?
Your country initiated this research!
Who' s going to take responsibility for this?
That must be our primary duty!
Can you see this long trail of gas, ladies and gentlemen?
The stench is incredible.
Even at this altitude and wearing a gas mask...... I can hardly keep my eyes open for more than a minute!
There is concern that it too may suffer the damages we' ve seen.
Nobuo!
Nobuo!
Can you hear me, Nobuo?
Don' t go to Tokyo!
Go back to the mountains!
I don' t understand why, but people will be in danger!
Don' t go to Tokyo!
Why is Grandma...?
Hurry!
Shoot him before he' s hidden in the gas!
- What was that?
- Hey, what are you doing?
Are you trying to kill my grandson?
Let me go!
What are you doing?
- Damn!
Eyes are watering!
- I' m taking us up!
- Shit!
Grandma!
Grandma!
Grandma!
What was...?
Message in from attack troops:
Commencing attack!
- Sci Ops contact imminent.
- Reading radio interference.
Target is at the rear left, approaching the bridge!
- He came out!
I see the target!
Get set to attack!
- I lost the target in the mist!
Just blast the area!
Fire!
What are you shooting at?
- The precision sight isn' t working!
What?
- What' s wrong?
- The engine!
Why are we stopping?
- I don' t know!
- Where are our tanks?
- The target is still moving.
Why can' t they stop him?
He' s passed Uenohara area just now.
- No contact with Atsugi Base!
The stink gas is scrambling the integrated circuits in our weapons!
Call the commander of the north- side troops!
Hurry!
Send the evacuation orders to Tokyo!
He' s still alive.
Moving toward east at 60 km per hour!
What' s wrong?
It' s broken?
The airport is now over crowd capacity.
Please follow orders.
In two hours the prime minister will issue a statement...... asking the world for assistance.
The U. N. Is then going to send in a peacekeeping operation.
Tokyo is going to turn into a sea of fire.
It' s useless to argue about who' s responsible for this disaster.
You' d better get out of here.
Think of your families.
But, commander, Your Excellency, what about you?
You called me "Your Excellency."
Everything is prepared, sir.
Very well.
Let' s pull out.
Aye, aye, sir!
You!
What is it?
What are you up to?
NASA' s latest space suit?
Yes.
Although it' s still a prototype...... it' s shielded from all types of electromagnetic radiation.
Even a hit from a trench mortar couldn' t stop it.
You' re trying to capture him alive, aren' t you?
Surely you won' t complain if we try?
Takao at all costs!
- Yes, sir!
Probably looking for me.
The whole thing' s turned into a real pain.
Why do I feel hungry all the time?
Good, we did it!
Switch on full power!
Freeze him like a Sapporo Snow Festival sculpture!
What' s that?
What?
Nobody told me about this!
What are you doing here?
- You can' t just come in here and...
- Orders, sir.
Captain!
The gas is getting stronger.
What?
Why' s it taking so long to get that liquid nitrogen?
Don' t go!
We can' t stimulate him any more!
He' s scared!
We' re even starting to get electrical discharges inside the gas cloud!
All right, go on, then!
I' il be here to clean up after you' re gone!
This side isn' t sealed off yet!
I can get out!
Withdraw!
It' s been 30 minutes since our last contact.
Have you heard anything yet?
The level...
- The level' s decreasing.
Nirasaki, are you sure?
This point is the highest.
Now it' s gone down to...
We' ve got communications back!
We' re getting video from the helicopter too.
Putting it on- screen.
- Now let' s bury that damn skunk!
- Yes, sir!
We' ve saved Japan.
I see.
The emperor didn' t get on the plane.
I' m glad we could defeat that man...... without making the emperor' s bravery all for nothing.
I see the space suit!
The American soldier' s back!
This is the...
Thank you.
Hello, Mr. Nirasaki.
I' m glad I could finally meet you.
I was worried about where they were taking me.
I really thought I wasn' t going to make it.
Let me get out of this thing.
What a stink!
You' il be late for school!
Is he still asleep?
I' ve told him he should wake up at least 30 minutes before breakfast.
Ten- hut!
Hurry up!
Coming!
Hut- two!
Good morning.
Why can' t you get up any earlier?
Everybody else is at morning training on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
I know it isn' t required, but it affects your grades!
You' il really have to earn that scholarship for next semester.
Your tuition goes up every year, and your dad' s salary isn' t following it.
Can I have a music helmet?
I want a music helmet!
They' re too dangerous.
You never listen to me.
Your grades stay the same.
You' re too far behind to get a scholarship!
You can' t expect us to buy you what you want!
Yeah.
Today' s wind is from the west at force level five.
For you.
And for you.
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
I' m off to shoot.
Ready to fire!
This is East 17 th Station.
17 th Cannon Station.
17 th Cannon Station.
Shoot and blast with all your strength for our nation.
Shoot and blast with all your strength for our nation.
Why was the 8 Cannon' s Life Quality Committee hauled up on charges?
Five minutes to roll call!
Everybody come to the hall right now.
No discipline, no victory!
Every day we have to give it all we' ve got!
Shoot and blast with all your strength for our nation!
And thus, we can calculate the theoretical location...... of the target by using the trigonometric functions...... of sine, cosine and tangent.
However, to achieve even greater accuracy...... we must account for the external factors which create aberrations.
Weather factors such as wind speed and direction...... which may affect the trajectory of the shot...... as well as the temperature and humidity...... which determine the condition of the gunpowder' s combustion.
This will be covered in your chemistry class.
Direction:
Everybody in line.

Evacuate cannon floor!
All personnel, evacuate!
All personnel, evacuate!
Evacuate!
- Yes, sir!
Hurry up!
Open valve number seven!
We are at pressure!
Thirty seconds to firing!
All personnel, tak e positions for shock wave!
Fire!
Lunchtime!
Eat as quickly as possible and get back to work!
There is no lunch break in the enemy' s attack.
We demand they use nontoxic gunpowder!
We deserve the right to work under safe and healthy conditions.
However, the gunpowder we now use contains harmful substances.
Here, take one.
- The chief really did that?
- That' s why he was transferred.
I heard it was because his wife is getting ready to have her baby.
It might end up with a mustache!
That' s okay.
His other kids don' t like anybody anyway!
I' ve never seen brothers as unlike each other as that.
And besides that, his wife is unbelievable!
Yeah!
Barrel cleaning completed!
Get ready to load the third shell!
- Lower crane!
- Lowering crane!
Bring down the shell tip!
What the hell are you doing?
You must have forgotten to check something!
Yes, load commander!
Your team is confined to the cannon floor!
Cannon now loaded.
All personnel, evacuate!
Hurry up!
Ten seconds to firing.
All personnel, brace for shock wave!
Fire!
Cannons 8 and 10, one each.
Damage inflicted to the enemy' s moving city:
Five major hits, seven medium, one light, one unconfirmed.
We have inflicted tremendous damage on them!
Our victory will soon come.
Shoot and blast with all your strength for our nation.
Shoot and blast with all your strength for our nation.
The Cannon Family again?
Bang!
It' s stupid.
You should go to bed.
It' il be lights out soon.
Who are we fighting?
You' il understand when you get bigger.
Now go to bed.
Yes, Dad!
Fire!
All right!
Ten- hut!
Forward!
Not just a cannon loader like my dad.
Ten- hut!
Aah!
[Hitting gong]
Mahtim!
Mahtim!
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
First off, I' d like to thank this board... for taking the time to hear my proposal.
Now, we' ve all heard of the legend of Atlantis... a continent somewhere in the mid- Atlantic... that was home to an advanced civilization... possessing technology far beyond our own... that, according to our friend Plato here... was suddenly struck by some cataclysmic event... that sank it beneath the sea.
Now, some of you may ask, why Atlantis?
Well, that is where you' d be wrong.
1 0, 000 years before the Egyptians... built the pyramids...
Well, no.
No, not for them.
Numerous ancient cultures all over the globe agree... that Atlantis possessed a power source of some kind... more powerful than steam, than -- than coal.
More powerful than our modern... internal combustion engines.
Gentlemen, I propose that we find Atlantis... find that power source... and bring it back to the surface.
Now, this is a page from an illuminated text... that describes a book called the Shepherd' s Journal... said to have been a first- hand account... of Atlantis and its exact whereabouts.
Now, based on a centuries- old translation of a Norse text... historians have believed the Journal resides in Ireland.
But after comparing the text... to the runes on this Viking shield...
I found that one of the letters... had been mistranslated.
Uhh!
Pause for effect.
Gentlemen, uh, I' il take your questions now.
[Rings]
Cartography and Linguistics, Milo Thatch speaking.
[Indistinct angry ranting]
Uh, just -- just a second.
[Hissing]
[Indistinct angry ranting]
Yeah.
And don' t let it happen again!
Ah, showtime.
Well, this is it.
I am finally getting out of the dungeon.
"that your meeting today has been moved up...
What?
[Whoosh]
"Dear Mr. Thatch, due to your absence....
"the board has voted to reject your proposal.
They can' t do this to me!
HARCOURT:
If I ever hear the word "Atlantis" again...
I' il push you!
Good Lord!
There he is!
Members of the board -- uh, wait!
Milo:
Head for the hills!
Milo:
Mr. Harcourt, you gotta listen to me, sir!
Uh, sir?
Mr. Harcourt!
Sir, I- I have new evidence that -- Please, Mr. Harcourt!
Thank you very much.
Look at --
This museum funds scientific expeditions... based on facts, not legends and folklore.
- We depend on you.
Yes!
What with winter coming... that boiler' s going to need a lot of attention.
But there -- there' s a journal!
It' s in Iceland!
I' m sure of it this time!
[Thud]
Sir, I really hoped it wouldn' t come to this... but this is -- uhh -- a letter of resignation.
I' il quit!
If you refuse to fund my proposal --
You' il what?
Flush your career down the toilet... just like your grandfather?
You have a lot of potential, Milo.
Don' t throw it all away chasing fairy tales.
You want to go on an expedition?
Here.
Take a trolley to the Potomac and jump in!
Heinz!
[Car drives off]
Here, kitty.
[Clicking]
Who -- who are you?
How did you get in here?
I came down the chimney.
Ho, ho, ho.
My name is Helga Sinclair.
I' m acting on behalf of my employer... who has a most intriguing proposition for you.
Heh.
Who is your employer?
And don' t drip on the Caravaggio.
Step lively.
Mr. Whitmore does not like to be kept waiting.
You will address him as "Mr. Whitmore" or "Sir."
Keep your sentences short and to the point.
[Gulp]
And relax.
He doesn' t bite... often.
Finest explorer I ever met.
Preston Whitmore.
Pleasure to meet you, Milo.
[Sighs]
Uh, no, no.
Thank you.
Oh, yeah.
Met old Thaddeus back in Georgetown.
Class of '66.
Even dragged me along... on some of his danged fool expeditions.
Thatch was crazy as a fruit bat, he was.
He spoke of you often.
He -- he never mentioned you.
He knew how much I liked my privacy.
[Grunting]
I keep a low profile.
Mr. Whitmore, should I be wondering why I' m here?
Look on that table.
Ah!
It' s for you.
It' s -- it' s from my grandfather.
He said if anything were to happen to him...
I should give it to you... when you were ready -- whatever that means.
Milo: lt --
It can' t be.
It' s the Shepherd' s Journal.
Ha ha ha!
No, no, no.
Look -- look at this.
It' s all right here.
Yeah, looks like gibberish to me.
That' s because it' s been written in a dialect... that no longer exists.
- No, no, just difficult.
I' ve spent my whole life studying dead languages.
It' s not gibberish to me.
Ah, it' s probably a fake.
Mr. Whitmore, my grandfather would have known... if this were a fake.
I would know.
So what do you want to do with it?
Well, I' il -- I' il -- I' il get funding.
I mean, I' il -- The museum --
They' il never believe you.
I' il show them!
Like you did today?
How did you...
Forget about them, OK?
Never mind!
I will find Atlantis on my own.
I mean, if I have to rent a rowboat!
Congratulations, Milo.
This is exactly what I wanted to hear.
But forget the rowboat, son.
We' il travel in style.
It' s all been arranged, the whole ball of wax.
For years your granddad bent my ear... with stories about that old book.
So finally I got fed up... and made a bet with the old coot.
I said, "Thatch, if you ever actually find...
"but I' il kiss you full on the mouth."
Now I know your grandfather' s gone, Milo...
God rest his soul, but Preston Whitmore... is a man who keeps his word.
You hear that, Thatch?
[Chuckles]
You probably don' t realize how great.
Those buffoons at the museum dragged him down... made a laughingstock of him.
He died a broken man.
Ah, Thatch.
What are we standing around for?
We got work to do.
You' il need engineers and -- and geologists.
Got 'em all.
Gaetan Moliere, geology and excavation.
The man has a nose for dirt.
Vincenzo Santorini, demolitions.
Busted him out of a Turkish prison.
Don' t let her age fool you.
She' s forgotten more about engines... than you or I will ever know.
WHlTMORE:
Iceland.
I knew it!
I knew it!
All we need now is an expert in gibberish.
So it' s decision time.
- This is for real.
All right.
It' s done.
You resigned this afternoon.
Milo:
I have to give notice.
- Taken care of.
- My clothes?
- Packed.
- In storage.
- My cat?
My gosh.
Your granddad had a saying.
"Our lives are remembered... by the gifts we leave our children."
This journal is his gift to you, Milo.
Atlantis is waiting.
What do you say?
You will not regret this.
Boy, I am so excited, I- I- I- I can' t even hold it in.
Carrots.
I didn' t even eat carrots.
Packard:
All hands to the launch bay.
To whoever took the "I" from the Motor Pool sign... ha ha, we are all very amused.
Excuse me?
Yes, Mr. Thatch?
Uh, it' s you!
Blondie, I got a bone to pick with you.
What is it this time, Cookie?
You done stuffed my wagon full to bustin 'with non- essentials.
Look at all this -- cinnamon, oregano, cilantro.
What in the cockadoodle is cilantro?
And what is this?
Lettuce?!
It' s a vegetable, Cookie.
The men need the four basic food groups.
I got your four basic food groups!
Beans, bacon, whiskey, and lard!
[Warning alarm sounds]
Pack it up and move it out.
Packard:
All hands to the launch bay.
[Elevator starts]
[Italian accent]
If you' re lookin 'for the pony rides... they' re back there.
Excuse me.
Excuse me?
You dropped your dy- dy- dy- dynamite.
What else have you, uh, got in there?
Oh, eh, gunpowder, nitroglycerin, notepads... fuses, wicks, glue, and... paper clips.
Big ones.
Milo!
Where you been?
I want you to meet Commander Rourke.
He led the Iceland team that brought the Journal back.
Milo Thatch.
Pleasure to meet the grandson of old Thaddeus.
I see you got that journal.
Nice pictures, but...
Pretty impressive, eh?
Boy, when you settle a bet, y- you settle a bet.
Well, your granddad always believed... you couldn' t put a price on the pursuit of knowledge.
Yes, this should be enriching for all of us.
Attention, all personnel.
Launch will commence in 15 minutes.
ROURKE:
It' s time.
- Bye, Mr. Whitmore!
- Make us proud, boy!
CHlEF OF THE WATCH:
Rig ship for dive.
Diving officer, submerge the ship.
Make the depth 1 - 5- 0 feet.
DlVING OFFlCER:
Dive, dive!
Five degrees down bubble.
Tonight' s supper will be baked beans.
Packard:
Who wrote this?
You have disturbed the dirt.
- You have disturbed the dirt!
Dirt from around the globe, spanning the centuries!
What have you done?
England must never merge with France!
- What' s it doin 'in my bed?
Who sent you?
Speak up!
- Bah!
I will know soon enough.
Let go!
Hold still.
Aha!
There you are.
Now tell me your story, my little friend.
Lead pencil, number 2.
Paint flecks... of a type used in government buildings.
You have a cat, short- haired Persian... two years old, third in a litter of seven.
There are all the microscopic fingerprints... of the mapmaker.
- Hey, how did you -- - This is an outrage!
Out, out, out, out, out!
Uh- oh.
Moliere, now what have I told you... about playing nice with the other kids?
Get back.
[Hisses]
[Grunts]
Joshua Sweet.
Medical officer.
Milo Thatch.
You' re my 3: 00.
Well, no time like the present.
- Nice, isn' t it?
The catalog says that this little beauty... can saw through a femur in 28 seconds.
Now, stick out your tongue and say "ahh."
- So, where you from?
I have family up that way.
Do you do any fishing?
[Garbled speech]
I hate fishing.
I hate fish.
[Sputters]
Packard:
Will Milo Thatch please report to the bridge?
Thank you.
I mean, uh, uh, nice meeting you.
Nice meeting you, too.
So I says to him, "What' s wrong with my meatloaf?"
And he says to me -- Oh.
Hold on a second, Margie, I got another call.
Sir, we' re approaching coordinates.
ROURKE:
Aye, sir.
Set course to 2- 4- 0.
15 degrees down angle on the bow planes.
Come right 2- 4- 0.
Welcome to the bridge, Mr. Thatch.
OK, everybody...
I want you to give Mr. Thatch... your undivided attention.
Good afternoon.
Can everyone hear me OK?
The -- the first slide is a depiction of a creature.
Hubba, hubba.
Uh, I' m sorry.
[Spanish accent]
Anyway, this, uh -- OK.
This is an illustration of the Leviathan... the creature guarding the entrance to Atlantis.
I would have white wine, I think.
It' s a mythical sea serpent.
He' s described in the Book of Job.
The -- the Bible says...
"Out of his mouth go burning lights... sparks of fire shoot out."
But more likely it' s a carving or a sculpture... to frighten the superstitious.
Then what?
When do we dig?
Actually, we don' t have to dig.
Kind of like the grease trap in your sink.
Cartographer, linguist, plumber.
Hard to believe he' s still single.
- Go away, Mole.
Captain, you' d better come look at this, sir.
OK, class dismissed.
Give me exterior lights.
There are ships here from every era.
Commander, I think you should hear this.
Commander?
"Enter the lair of the Leviathan."
Commander?
Packard:
Commander?
I' m picking up something on the hydrophone...
- I think you should hear.
- Put it on speakers.
[Groaning and whooshing sounds]
What is it?
Bigger.
Could be an echo off one of the rocks.
Do you want to do my job?
Be my guest.
Is it just me, or is that getting louder?
Bring us about.
Tighten our search pattern and slow us to --
[Crash]
[Crew shouting]
Load the torpedo bays!
Subpod crews, battle stations!
Don' t panic.
Jiminy Christmas!
It' s a machine!
Uhh!
Subpods away!
We' re free.
All ahead full.
Fire torpedoes!
Sir, it' s engineering on four.
Rourke!
I don' t want to be around when it hits the boilers.
How much time do we have?
[Clang]
You better make that five.
Move!
Move where?
Packard, sound the alarm!
He took his suitcase?
- Packard!
- I have to call you back.
No, no, I' il call you.
[Alarm sounds]
Move it, people!
Sometime today would be nice!
Come on!
Lieutenant, get us out of here!
Helga:
[Roars]
Hang on.
We' re looking for a big crevice of some kind.
Up ahead.
All craft, make your mark 20 degrees down angle.
Roger!
20 degrees down angle.
Right behind you!
MAN:
We' re getting killed out here!
It' s only a grease trap.
It' s just like a sink.
It' s just like a sink!
Seven hours ago, we started this expedition... with 200 of the finest men and women I' ve ever known.
I won' t sugar- coat it, gentlemen.
We have a crisis on our hands.
But we' ve been up this particular creek before... and we' ve always come through, paddle or no paddle.
I see no reason to change that policy now.
From here on in, everyone pulls double duty.
Everyone drives, everyone works.
You and that little book.
We' re all gonna die.
Saddle up.
Lieutenant, I want this convoy moving five minutes ago.
You know the rules.
I want you 50 yards... behind that truck at all times.
[Beep beep]
- Uhh...
Heh heh.
Of course I can drive a truck.
I mean, sure, you got your steering... and your gas and your brake... and, of course, this metal, uh, looking... thing.
Come on!
Second Driver:
Oof.
- Mm- hmm.
- [Gags]
Eh, don' t breathe.
Don' t do anything, except pray maybe.
Good night!
It' s gotta be half a mile high at least.
It -- it must have taken hundred -- no, pfft, thousands of years to carve this thing.
It only took me, like, what?
1 0 seconds, 1 1, tops.
Vinny, what do you think?
I could unroadblock that if I had about 200 of these.
Problem is I only got about... 1 0.
Hey, too bad we don' t have some nitroglycerin, eh, Milo?
[Laughing hysterically]
[Gasps gleefully]
It will be my pleasure.
Oh!
I don' t understand it.
I just tuned this thing up this morning.
Um...
I' m gonna have to pull a spare... from one of the trucks.
I' il be right back.
Hey, what' d you do?
Well, you know, the boiler in this baby... is a Humac model P54/ 81 3.
Now we got the 81 4 back at the museum.
Persuade 'em a little.
Shut up.
Two for flinching.
Ooh!
This is it.
ROURKE:
Pah!
It is a natural phosphorescence.
That thing is going to keep me up all night, I know it.
Come and get it!
- I wanted the escargot.
Knock yourself out.
There you go, Milo.
Put some meat on them bones.
Thanks, Cookie.
That looks greasier than usual.
You like it?
You' re so skinny, if you turned sideways... and stuck out your tongue you' d look like a zipper.
What do you say we cut him some slack?
Yeah, you' re right.
Really?
You don' t mind?
Gee, this is great.
I mean, you know... it' s an honor to be included in your --
[Pbbbt]
- Mole!
Hey, Milo, don' t you ever close that book?
Yeah, you must' ve read it a dozen times by now.
I know, but this -- this doesn' t make any sense.
It could be the power source the legends refer to.
But then it just -- it cuts off.
Kid, relax.
We don' t get paid overtime.
Sometimes I get a little carried away.
But, hey, you know, that' s what this is all about, right?
I mean, discovery, teamwork, adventure.
Unless, maybe... you' re just in it for the money.
- Money.
I' m gonna say... money.
[Sighs]
Well, I guess I set myself up for that one.
Oh, yeah, I must' ve hurt it when --
Ow!
Better?
Hey, how' d you learn how to do that?
- An Arapaho medicine man.
Born and raised with 'em.
My father was an army medic.
He settled down in the Kansas Territory... after he met my mother.
Nope.
I got a sheepskin from Howard U. and a bearskin from old Iron Cloud.
Halfway through medical school, I was drafted.
Main course.
I' m watching my weight.
Ha ha ha, don' t you worry.
It' il keep and keep and keep.
Thank God I lost my sense of taste years ago.
Uh, I did.
I guess I' m still a little rusty at this.
I haven' t gone camping since... well, the last time my grandpa took me.
What was he like?
He was like a father to me, really.
My parents died when I was a little kid... and he took me in.
Well, I was just thinkin '.
One time, when I was eight, we were hiking along this stream... and I saw something shining in the water.
It was a genuine arrowhead.
Well, you' d think I' d found a lost civilization... the way Grandpa carried on about it.
It wasn' t until I was older... that I realized that the arrowhead... was just some compressed shale... mixed with zinc pyrite that had fractured... into an isosceletic triangulate.
That is so cute!
Say, Audrey, uh, no -- no offense... but how does a teenager become the chief mechanic... of a multimillion dollar expedition?
Well, I took this job when my dad retired.
But the funny thing was... he always wanted sons, right?
But he got my sister and me instead.
So, what -- what happened to your sister?
She' s 24 and 0, with a shot at the title next month.
Forget your jammies, Mrs. Packard?
I sleep in the nude.
You' re gonna want a pair of these.
She sleepwalks.
Well, as far as me goes...
Come on, Vinny... tell the kid the truth.
My family owned a flower shop.
We would sell roses... carnations, baby' s breath, you name it.
One day, I' m making... about three dozen corsages for this prom.
And everybody, they come.
"Where is it?"
"When is it?"
It' s a nightmare.
Anyway, I guess there was this leak next door... of gas or what.
Blew me right through the front window.
It was like a sign from God.
[Grunting]
What' s Mole' s story?
You don' t wanna know.
Audrey, don' t tell him.
You shouldn' t have... told me, but you did.
And now I' m telling you... you don' t wanna know.
[Snores]
Holy -- Whoa!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Milo:
Thatch, go back to bed.
No time!
Move it!
Move it!
Right now!
All right, who' s not dead?
[Groaning and muttering]
Somebody' s gonna have to suck out that poison.
Now don' t everybody jump up at once.
[Sighing]
Not as bad as it could have been.
We totaled rigs two and seven... but the digger looks like it' il still run.
Pumice ash.
We are standing... at the base of a dormant volcano.
Maybe that' s our ticket outta here.
Maybe not.
The magma has solidified in the bowels of the volcano... effectively blocking the exit.
Hold on.
Back up.
Are you sayin 'this whole volcano... can blow at any time?
No, no, no, no.
That would take an explosive force... of great magnitude.
Maybe I should do this later, huh?
If we could blow the top off of that thing, we' d have a straight shot to the surface.
Mr. Thatch, what do you think?
Mr. Thatch?
Thatch?
[Breathing heavily]
Milo:
Who -- who are you?
Where are you going?
[Grunting]
Who are you?
It' s beautiful.
Milo, I gotta hand it to you.
You really came through.
[Screeching]
Holy cats!
Who are these guys?
- They gotta be Atlanteans.
- What?
That' s impossible!
I seen this back in the Dakota.
So keep quiet.
[Speaking Atlantean]
[Speaking Atlantean]
Dices linguam Romae.
Parlez- vous francais?
They speak my language!
Pardon, mademoiselle?
Ah, voulez- vous...
[Whispering]
'Bout time someone hit him.
Buenos dias.
Guten tag!
[Atlanteans speaking various languages]
Their language must be based on a root dialect.
It' s just like the Tower of Babel.
Well, maybe English is in there somewhere.
We are explorers from the surface world.
We come in peace.
Welcome to the city of Atlantis.
You must speak with my father now.
Squad "B," head back to the shaft... and salvage what you can.
OFFlCER:
You heard him.
[Sighs]
I' m so excited!
Or at least you' d be in the same ballpark...
- Someone' s having a good time.
- Like a kid at Christmas.
Commander, there were not supposed to be people down here.
This changes nothing.
Take that, Mr. Harcourt!
Your Majesty?
On behalf of my crew... may I say it is an honor to be welcomed to your city.
Commander?
You presume much... to think you are welcome here.
Oh, sir, we have come a long way looking for --
I know what you seek... and you will not find it here.
Your journey has been in vain.
But we are peaceful explorers, men of science.
And yet you bring weapons.
Our weapons allow us to remove obstacles we may encounter.
Some obstacles cannot be removed with a mere show of force.
You must leave Atlantis at once.
Oh, Your Majesty, be reasonable.
Trust me on this.
We better do as he says.
May I respectfully request that we stay one night, sir?
Hmm.
Very well.
One night.
Well, thank you, Your Majesty.
Your heart has softened, Kida.
A thousand years ago... you would have slain them on sight.
A thousand years ago, the streets were lit... and our people did not have to scavenge for food... at the edge of a crumbling city!
They do not know any better!
We were once a great people.
Now we live in ruins.
The kings of our past would weep... if they could see how far we have fallen.
- If these outsiders... can unlock the secrets of our past... perhaps we can save our future.
Our way of life is dying.
Our way of life is preserved.
So, how' d it go?
Well, the King and his daughter don' t exactly see eye to eye.
She seems to like us OK, but the King...
Well, if he' s hiding something, I want to know what it is.
Someone needs to talk to that girl.
I will go!
I will do it!
Someone who won' t scare her away.
I volunteer!
Someone who can speak the language.
For the good of the mission, I will go!
Good man, Thatch.
Thanks for volunteering.
Go get 'em, tiger.
"Look, I have some questions for you... and I' m not leaving this city until they' re answered!"
That' s good, that' s good.
Shh!
Come with me.
Oh, there is so much to ask about your world.
You are a scholar, are you not?
What is your country of origin?
When did the flood waters recede?
- How did you -- - Wait a minute.
So let' s do this, OK?
You ask one, then I' il ask one... then you, then me, then...
Well, you get it.
Very well.
What is your first question?
Well, I mean, not you personally... but your -- your culture.
I mean, how did all of this end up down here?
It is said that the gods became jealous of Atlantis.
They sent a great cataclysm and banished us here.
All I can remember is the sky going dark... and people shouting and running.
My father said it called my mother to it.
I never saw her again.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!
Whoa, back up!
Wh -- what -- what are you telling me... that you remember because you were there?
No, that -- that' s impossible... because, I mean, that would make you... you know, 8, 500- 8, 800 years old.
Oh, well, hey, uh, pfft!
Lookin 'good.
Yes.
How is it you found your way to this place?
If it weren' t for this book, we never would have made it.
OK, second question.
You mean you can understand this?
Yes, I' m a linguist.
Now, getting back to my question --
This, right here, you can read this?
Yes, yes, I can read Atlantean, just like you.
No one can.
Such knowledge has been lost to us... since the time of the Mehbelmok.
OK, uh...
[Reading in Atlantean]
Yeah.
Yeah, that' s it.
How was my accent?
Yeah, gotta work on that.
Here, let me show you something.
It looks like some sort of vehicle.
Yes.
But no matter what I try... it will not respond.
- Perhaps if -- - Way ahead of you.
OK, let' s see what we got here.
OK.
"Place crystal into slot."
"Gently place your hand on the inscription pad."
- Yes!
- OK, did you... turn the crystal one- quarter turn back?
While your hand was on the inscription pad?
Ye -- No.
Ah, well, see, there' s your problem right there.
That' s an easy thing to miss.
You know, you deserve credit... for even -- even gettin 'this far.
[Gasps]
Oh, th -- this is great!
With this thing...
Wonder how fast it goes.
[Crashing]
So, who' s hungry?
My name' s Milo.
My name is Kidagakash.
Ki- Ki- Kidamaschnaga.
Uh, hey, you got a nickname?
[Giggles]
I can remember that.
I just... got something in my eye.
You know, my grandpa used to tell me stories... about this place as far back as I can remember.
I just wish he could be standing here with me.
Your physician, he is called Cookie?
The doctor.
He' s Sweet.
Oh, he is kindly.
No, no, no, that -- that' s his name.
No, Sweet.
Well, I mean, he' s kindly, too.
So all of your doctors are sweet and kindly?
Well, I- I' m sure some are.
You' re missing the point.
You are confusing me.
Wow.
Shoot.
That ain' t nothin '.
Look here what I got.
All 38 United States.
Dance.
[Sloshing]
There you go.
[Giggling]
Cookies are sweet, but yours is not.
Sweet is kindly, but that is not his name.
Audrey is sweet, but she is not your doctor.
[Slurping]
That' s where all the nutrients are.
[Swallows and burps]
You know, Kida... the most we ever hoped to find... was some crumbling buildings, maybe some broken pottery.
Instead, we find a living, thriving society.
We are not thriving.
True, our people live... but our culture is dying.
We are like a stone the ocean beats against.
With each passing year... a little more of us is worn away.
I wish there was something I could do.
I have brought you to this place to ask you for your help.
There is a mural here... with writing all around the pictures.
OK, let me see.
Let' s start with this column right here.
Uh, well, this, uh, uh, Kida?
You do swim, do you not?
Pr- pretty good!
Sw -- Good, swim good.
Pretty good.
Good.
It is a fair distance to where we are going.
[Giggles]
Come on, we' re -- we' re wasting time.
Why don' t you lead the way... because I have no idea where we' re going.
- Are you all right?
Good.
Follow me.
A complete history of Atlantis!
It' s just like Plato described it.
Well, he was off on a few details, but --
The star in the middle of the city.
What does the writing say about that?
I don' t know yet.
But we' re gonna find out.
Come on.
- What?
It' s the heart of Atlantis!
That' s what the shepherd w- was talking about.
It wasn' t a star, it was -- it was some kind of crystal... uh, like these!
Don' t you get it?
The power source I' ve been looking for... the bright light you remember...
- That cannot be.
It' s what' s keeping all these things... you, all of Atlantis alive.
I don' t know, I don' t know.
You' d think something this important... would have been in the Journal, but...
The missing page.
You have a nice swim?
Hey, guys, what' s going on?
Milo:
This is just another treasure hunt for you.
You' re after the crystal.
Oh, you mean this?
Yeah.
About that...
Welcome to the club, son.
I' m no mercenary.
Whoa!
I prefer the term "adventure capitalist."
Besides, you' re the one who got us here.
You led us right to the treasure chest.
What' s to know?
It' s shiny.
It' s going to make us all rich.
I thought it was some kind of a battery... but we' re both wrong.
That crystal is the only thing keeping these people alive.
You take that away, and they' il die.
Well, that changes things.
Helga, what do you think?
Knowing that, I' d double the price.
I was thinking triple.
Rourke, don' t do this.
Academics.
You never want to get your hands dirty.
If you gave back every stolen artifact... from a museum... you' d be left with an empty building.
We' re just providing a necessary service... to the archeological community.
I got to admit, I' m disappointed.
You' re an idealist, just like your grandfather.
Do yourself a favor, Milo.
Don' t be like him.
For once, do the smart thing.
I really hate it when negotiations go sour.
- Knock, knock.
- Room service.
Tell them to drop their weapons -- now!
[Speaking Atlantean]
Search everywhere!
You' re not applying yourself, son.
Well, there isn' t.
It just says...
"The heart of Atlantis lies in the eyes of her king."
ROURKE:
How about it, chief?
Where' s the crystal chamber?
You will destroy yourselves.
Maybe I' m not being clear.
Ohh!
Plan' s changed, doc.
I' d suggest you put a bandage... on that bleeding heart of yours.
It doesn' t suit a mercenary.
Well, as usual, diplomacy has failed us.
[Cocks gun]
2... 9... t --
This is it.
Rourke, for the last time... you' ve got to listen to me.
You don' t have the slightest idea... what this power is capable of.
True, but I can think of a few countries... who' d pay anything to find out.
Get on.
Jackpot.
[Speaking Atlantean softly]
We got a schedule to meet.
I' m sorry.
I don' t like this place.
All right, Thatch, what' s next?
OK, there' s a giant crystal... hovering 150 feet above our heads... over a bottomless pit of water.
The only thing that surprises me...
That thing' s not on the truck yet.
Now move it!
I don' t know how to move it.
I don' t even know what' s holding it up there.
What' s happening?
Look, all it says here... is that the crystal is alive somehow.
It' s their deity.
Speak English, professor.
Milo:
It' s a part of them.
I -- I' m doing the best I can here.
Oh, I know.
Why don' t you translate... and I' il wave the gun around.
I -- I didn' t catch it.
Kida.
Kida.
No, don' t.
Don' t touch her.
You heard him.
Step back.
I' m warning you.
You win.
Congratulations, Audrey.
Guess you and your dad will be able... to open up that second garage after all.
I' m sure your family' s going to be very proud.
But that' s what it' s all about, right?
Money.
Get off your soapbox, Thatch.
You' ve read Darwin.
We' re just helping it along.
Yeah, give me a minute.
I know I' m forgetting something.
I got the cargo, the crystal, the crew...
[Atlanteans gasp]
Look at it this way, son.
You were the man who discovered Atlantis... and now you' re part of the exhibit.
That was an order, not a suggestion.
Let' s go!
ROURKE:
This is wrong, and you know it.
We' re this close to our biggest payday ever... and you pick now of all times to grow a conscience.
We' ve done a lot of things we' re not proud of -- robbing graves, plundering tombs... double parking -- but nobody got hurt.
Well, maybe somebody got hurt... but nobody we knew.
More for me.
P. T. Barnum was right.
[Engine backfires]
Wait a second.
Milo, you better get up here.
Not good, I' m afraid.
Internal bleeding.
There' s nothing more I can do.
What a nightmare.
And I brought it here.
He' s been after that crystal since Iceland.
The crystal.
Sweet, that' s it.
These -- these crystals... they have some sort of healing energy.
I' ve -- I' ve seen it work.
No.
Where is my daughter?
Well, she -- she...
She has been chosen...
What?
KlNG:
In times of danger... the crystal will choose a host... one of royal blood... to protect itself... and its people.
W- Wait a minute.
Choose?
So this thing is alive?
In a way.
The crystal thrives... on the collective emotions... of all who came before us.
longevity, protection.
[Coughs]
I sought to use it as a weapon of war... but it' s power proved too great to control.
That' s why you hid it beneath the city -- to keep history from repeating itself.
KlNG:
Wh --
What' s going to happen to Kida?
If she remains bonded to the crystal... she could be lost to it forever.
The love of my daughter is all I have left.
Me?
Return the crystal.
[Coughs]
Save my daughter.
[Stops breathing]
Excuse me?
I followed you in, and I' il follow you out.
It' s your decision.
Oh, my decision?
Well, I think we' ve seen how effective... my decisions have been.
Let' s recap.
I lead a band of plundering vandals... to the greatest archeological find... in recorded history... thus enabling the kidnap and/ or murder... of the royal family... not to mention personally delivering... the most powerful force known to man... into the hands of a mercenary nutcase... who' s probably going to sell it to the Kaiser!
Well, you did set the camp on fire... and drop us down that big hole.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Of course, it' s been my experience... when you hit bottom... the only place left to go is up.
Who told you that?
A fella by the name of Thaddeus Thatch.
Milo, that' s crazy.
I didn' t say it was the smart thing... but it is the right thing.
Come on.
We better make sure he doesn' t hurt himself.
Just follow my lead.
[Engine revs]
It' s simple.
All you got to do --
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, no, wait!
[Thud]
Just gently.
Hey, Milo, you got something sporty?
You know, like a tuna?
All you got to do is use the crystals.
Kida showed me.
Keep your hand on the pad.
Saddle up, partners.
Bring jerky and ammo.
[Engines revving]
I' m so excited.
We' re going to rescue the princess.
Or we' re going to die trying.
Now let' s do it!
[Atlanteans cheering]
I love it when I win.
Well, I' ve got news for you, Milo.
Well, do you have any suggestions?
Don' t get shot.
We' ve got company!
Take off!
Take her up!
You told me he only had guns.
What I said was, he' s never surprised.
Heads up!
We can' t let them reach the top of that shaft!
Aah!
Audrey, Sweet, fly up underneath that thing... and cut her loose.
We' re on it.
Lieutenant!
Less talk, more saw.
Come on, girl.
AUDREY:
All right, Milo, this is it.
Any last words?
Yeah.
I really wish I had a better idea than this!
Lighten the load.
Unh!
Uhh!
You promised me a percentage!
Next time, get it in writing.
Aah!
Yaah!
You' re a bigger pain in the neck... than I would have ever thought possible.
I consider myself an even- tempered man.
It takes a lot to get under my skin... but congratulations -- you just won the solid- gold kewpie doll.
Nothing personal.
Hyah!
Aw, that' s a darn shame... because I' m just getting warmed up.
[Growls]
Oh, great!
Hey, I had nothing to do with it.
No, wait.
We got to get her back... or the whole city will die.
And if we don' t get out of here, we' il die.
It' s the only way to reverse this.
Just do it!
Milo, no!
Milo:
Milo, Mole says the wall' s going to blow!
Uhh!
Milo?
I only wish there was more we could do for you.
Uh, you know, thanks anyway... but I think we' re good.
They' il take you as far as the surface.
We are really going to miss you, Milo.
You know, I' m going to reopen the flower shop... and I' m going to think of you guys every single day --
Saturday until 2: 00.
Sunday -- I' m going to take Sunday off probably, and...
Maybe I' il go in for a couple of hours, you know... but August -- I' m going to take August.
I ain' t so good at speechifyin '... but I wanted you to have this.
Cookie, I --
Aw...
MOLE:
[Insects buzzing]
Mole.
Hey, well... good- bye, Mole.
There' s a hero' s welcome... waiting for the man who discovered Atlantis.
Ah, I don' t think the world needs another hero.
Besides, I hear there' s an opening down here... for an expert in gibberish.
You, too, Sweet.
Come here.
Unh!
No problem.
[Crack]
Thanks.
Oh, you' re getting a bill.
Can we go home now?
Come on, y' all.
Say "Gochk."
[Camera shutter clicks]
Nope.
Just a lot of rocks... and fish -- little fish.
What happened to Helga?
Well, we lost her when a flaming zeppelin come down on her.
Missing.
And Rourke?
Nervous breakdown.
You could say he went all to pieces.
He' s missing, too.
Went down with the sub.
[Mole burrows]
Ohh.
At least he' s in a better place now.
I hope this piece of proof is enough for you.
They' il try to hold you back
And they will say you' re wrong
But they will never understand
The journey that you' re on
They' il try to change your mind
They' il try to change your heart
But they will never understand
Who you are
Still believe
And you know
You must go
Where the dream takes you
Where your heart longs to be
When you finally find that place
You' il find all you need
Where the dream takes you
Oh, whoa
There' s something in your soul
Something in your soul
That won' t be denied
It' s the faith to dream that keeps
The dream alive
So you' il still believe
And you know
You must go
Where the dream takes you
Where the dream takes you
Where your heart longs to be
When you finally find that place
You' il find all you need
Where the dream takes you
Go where your heart is meant to be
Somebody there
Someone to share your dream
When you finally find that place
You' il find all you need
Where the dream leads you
Your dream will lead you on
Only your heart can see
There' s a world that waits for you
You' re not alone
Where the dream takes you
Try to change your mind
Where the dream takes you
Try to change your heart
Where the dream takes you
But you must go
Where the dream takes you
THE TRlPLETS OF BELLEVlLLE
We apologize for this interruption...
Is the movie over?
Don' t you want to tell grandma?
Is the movie over?
We now continue with a musical interlude.
In this 17th stage of the Tour de France the pack, the machine of muscles and steel, finally gets going.
But before the rubber tests the overheated paving- stones of Marseille, these young lads still have many obstacles to face.
And a fantastic escape by the yellow jersey, who devours Klaut and Glutman of the canned food factory from Frankfurt.
They' il have a hard time catching up on the spot where they already failed miserably last year,
When they really had to bite the bullet.
On the face of this great eagle.
The very top lies at an altitude of 1912 metres, the horrible Ventoux, an impressive scenery of white desert, under a burning sun.
Constantly watching their gear ratio, It is hell.
That supporters know so well.
The pack sink into oblivion.
For some the bell already sounds And they give up.
lose pace, fall behind, vanish into nothingness.
Together with a dazzling speed comes the liberating descent to Marseille.
Keep going, my boy!
Insurance company "The Pigeon" gives away a whole week’ s free insurance for the best sprinter.
Yes, that' s right, for free, for his bicycle.
My box!
That' s my box!
Give me back my box!
Is that your dog?
I don’ t believe it!
The nerve!
She now has my box and the dog!
Here, stuff this!
Dried tadpoles
Get out.
And now:
The triplets of Belleville.
Another racer’ s grave discovered.
Third in two months ’ time
Sinister details
Investigation got stuck
French Mafia denies everything!
BELLEVlLLE Thank you for your visit - Goodbye
Is the movie over?
Don' t you want to tell grandma?
Is the movie over?
It' s finished, grandma.
For my parents.
Ripped by Michoo (michoo22@ o2. pl)
{y: i} And the streams {y: i} were gurgling happily.
{y: i} But all that changed when... {y: i}... the stranger came.
Honey.
Honey.
Oh, bother.
Oh, d- d- dear!
Oh, my!
It' s got me!
Dear Roo.
All excited to go out already?
You' re not even dressed yet.
Mama, did you hear that sound?
What sort of sound, dear?
I don' t know.
It was sort of strange.
And kind of neat.
- Oh, the bother...
- Did it sound something like that?
No, Mama.
That' s a Pooh Bear.
Good morning, Pooh.
What?
Oh, well, uh, good morning, Roo.
I wish it was.
- Why?
What happened?
- Many things.
- Oh, dear.
I' m sorry, Roo.
I must be going.
Oh, bother.
- Oh, d- d- d- dear.
What happened?
Where' s everybody going?
To Rabbit' s house.
He' il know what to do.
I hope.
Whatever do you suppose is going on?
I' m gonna go see.
Have fun, dear.
Come home when I call.
Yes, Mama.
Piglet!
Wait for me!
Hold tight, Piglet.
Pooh!
Piglet!
Tigger!
- It' s a Hundred Acre "catastrophide"!
- Help!
Open up in the name of us!
Quick, Rabbit!
Help!
All right.
Uh, what?
- Thank goodness you' re all right.
- It came at me!
- I heard this neat sound.
- Terrible.
- What' s this all about?
- It chilled me to the bone.
- I was asleep.
- Something like...... this.
- One at a time!
Thank you.
Now, what is going...
Me!
Pick me!
Me, me, me!
- Tigger?
- There I was, sleeping, dreaming Tiggerish dreams.
And suddenly everything starts shaking.
And there' s stuff falling everywhere.
And then it stops.
And I look around.
And there it wasn' t, my most "favoritest" family portrait.
It was clean gone.
Did it look something like this, Tigger?
Yeah, it was...
Actually, it had a little less Pooh in it.
I see.
And, uh, Pooh Bear, what about you?
Oh...
And...
Well, actually, I ate my honey.
- Humph.
I was asleep in bed, and I heard this neat trumpety sound, and...
Very good.
Now, Piglet, tell us what happened to you.
Actually, I- I- I' d like very much to forget.
Well, what we have here is a mystery...
- Wow!... of the most mysterious kind.
Look what I found.
It' s a swimming pool.
The sky has finally fallen.
Always knew it would.
Oh, m- m- m- my!
It looks like a footprint.
That' s "impossibibble."
A footprint, indeed.
Anyone can see it' s only a... a... a...
Rabbit, what sort of creature do you suppose would be attached to a foot that...... big?
There' s only one thing it could be.
Excuse me.
What' s a Heffalump?
- What' s a Heffalump?
{y: i} Everyone knows {y: i} what a Heffalump' s like {y: i} It' s got fiery eyes {y: i} and a tail with a spike {y: i} Claws on its paws {y: i} are sharp as a tack {y: i} And wing- a- ma- things {y: i} coming out of its back
- Out of its back?
- Of course, Roo.
{y: i} Its bottom is up {y: i} and its top' s really down {y: i} So its nose is its tail {y: i} or the other way 'round {y: i} Yeah, and it' s wide as a river {y: i} and tall as a tree
- {y: i} It clomps here and there - {y: i} It stomps to and fro
- {y: i} Got three horns above - {y: i} And eleven below
- {y: i} Those are its good points - {y: i} There' s much more to know {y: i} About the {y: i} dreadfully dreaded {y: i} Thoroughly three- headed {y: i} Horribly hazardous Heffalumps
Wow.
Neat.
Neat?
{y: i} Everyone knows {y: i} they lurk and they creep {y: i} The best time to see one {y: i} is when it' s asleep {y: i} If you sneak up {y: i} behind it and get it to jump {y: i} You can tell which part' s {y: i} Heffa- hee- hee {y: i} And which part is lump {y: i} They' il steal all your {y: i} honey and eat your last crust {y: i} Stomp on your house {y: i} till it' s nothing but dust {y: i} The worst part of all is
They' re different from us?
{y: i} They' re the {y: i} dreadfully dreaded {y: i} Thoroughly three- headed {y: i} Fiercely ferociously {y: i} Mostly atrociously {y: i} Horribly hazardous
{y: i} Heffalumps
Yeah!
And they live right over there.
Heffalump Hollow.
Oh, oh, d- d- d- d- dear!
I know.
I know.
Let' s go get them.
Capture a Heffalump?
Impossible.
Besides, it' s never been done.
Then we' d be the first to do it.
It' d be fun.
It' d be an adventure.
It' d be...... an "expotition."
Yes.
Well, now that I think of it, it would be a first.
- Oh, yes.
The first Heffalump expedition in history.
Oh, splendid idea.
Glad I thought of it.
Of course, capturing a Heffalump is a perilous affair.
Meticulous planning is called for.
But how does one capture a Heffalump?
How, you ask?
It' s quite simple, really.
- Humph.
All right.
Let' s see what everyone' s brought.
Has anyone brought anything useful?
I brought some rope.
My thought exactly.
Thank you, Roo.
You see, a simple piece of rope if the most effective device for capturing Heffalumps.
Now, everyone together.
I capture you. "
I capture you!
And toss.
Brilliant.
Whoa!
I did it!
I did it!
I' m gonna capture a whole bunch of Heffalumps.
Come on, everybody.
Let' s go get them.
Just a moment, Roo.
A Heffalump expedition is fraught with danger.
But we gotta go catch the Heffalump.
Roo, you just can' t argue with a word like "fraught."
- But I really want to go.
- It' s too dangerous, Roo.
You' re simply too young.
You could get hurt.
But I...
Roo!
Time to come home!
Roo, dear!
You mean I can' t go?
- I' m...
- Roo!
Coming, Mom.
Oh, don' t be sad, Roo.
I- I- I think you' re very, very lucky.
All right, everyone, we' il meet here tomorrow morning for the grand expedition.
And Rabbit and Tigger are quite sure Heffalumps are so awful?
And everybody' s gonna catch one but me.
It isn' t fair.
Oh, I' m sorry, Roo, but there will certainly be other adventures you can go on.
Aren' t I, Mom?
You' re growing up very fast, indeed, dear.
Faster than you think.
Do you think I could grow up by tomorrow morning?
So soon?
Why?
Then I could go on the "expotition."
You know, dear, growing up doesn' t happen all at once.
It takes its own time.
But I need to grow up now.
little Mister Roo?
{y: i} And no time for dreaming
{y: i} And little Mister Roo {y: i} Reaching for the moon {y: i} Don' t grow up too fast {y: i} Too soon
Do you want your nighty light?
No, thanks.
I don' t need it anymore.
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night, Mama.
I just know I could catch one.
Ah, yes.
A perfect morning for catching Heffalumps.
It' s very brave of you to join us, Piglet.
Especially since it' s so very dangerous.
Well, I thought of hiding under my bed, Pooh Bear, but I' d rather be hiding out here with all of you...... than under my bed, with all of me!
We' ve gathered the best minds to the task.
Namely my own.
We simply can' t fail.
Right you are, Rabber- rific.
With Tigger' s Heffalump- tracking skills, it' s a fate- a- complicated.
With courage, cunning, and superior tactics, we' il be home by teatime.
Oh, I hope so.
Behold.
Heffalump Hollow.
Home of the dreaded Heffalump.
I believe that what' s over there doesn' t look quite as friendly as what' s over here.
Fiddlesticks and nonsense.
There' s nothing to be afraid of.
There you go.
See?
Rabbit didn' t get gobbled up.
Yet.
Okay.
Well, would you look at that.
I didn' t get gobbled up either.
- Yet.
There you are, Piglet.
It seems that both sides of the fence are about the same.
So far.
Now to teach those Heffalumps a thing or two.
Ready!
{y: i} No time to lose {y: i} Chin up, tallyho {y: i} We' il never stop {y: i} till those Heffalumps go {y: i} The best Heffa- quest {y: i} you' il ever know {y: i} They' re the {y: i} dreadfully dreaded {y: i} Thoroughly three- headed {y: i} Horribly hazardous Heffalumps {y: i} The dreadfully dreaded {y: i} Thoroughly three- headed
- {y: i} Massively monstrously - {y: i} Unbearably scare- ably {y: i} Horribly hazardous Heffalumps
- Thank you, Pooh Bear.
- You' re welcome.
- Oh!
Uh, coming.
- Safety in numbers, you know.
You know, if we didn' t stick together, we would be very lost indeed.
Don' t let me hold you up.
- Got it.
Who' s there?
Hello?
Is anyone there?
Who' s there?
You' re it.
Now you gotta catch me.
- I really need to go, 'cause...
How come?
Because...
- I' ve got to catch a Heffalump.
- Oh, really?
You can catch me.
I' m a Heffalump.
A Heffalump?
Heffalump.
Heffalump.
That' s what I am, all right.
A Heffalump.
But you can' t be.
Actually, I am.
If you' re a Heffalump...... then where' s your horns and spiky tail?
I don' t know.
Wow, a spiky tail.
I wish I had one.
Are you sure you' re a Heffalump?
My mummy says I am.
I capture you.
Okay.
Jump.
I did it.
I did it!
You did it!
You did it!
You did it!
You did it!
Wait.
Whoa!
I capture you!
I capture you!
Whoa!
You' re supposed to come with me!
Um...... Piglet?
Why are you setting out little pink jelly beans?
I' ve been leaving a trail so we can find our way back from the Heffalump "expotition."
Oh, bother.
Oh, no.
We' re lost!
- Stop!
- Okay.
What game should we play now?
Rumblejump?
Leaplog?
Or Hogswallow?
We can' t play any games.
- Why?
- You' ve gotta come with me.
Why?
Because I captured you.
Why?
Because...
Because I' m a grownup.
Wow.
You' re a grownup?
- A grownup.
You must have your own call, then.
My call?
Yeah, like this.
Like that.
But only better.
Haven' t found mine yet.
My mum said I' il find it when I grow up.
I can' t wait till I grow up.
Well, growing up takes a long time.
It took me just about forever.
That' s it.
That' s the sound I heard.
Gotta go now.
Bye.
Wait a minute.
You can' t leave.
But my mummy' s calling.
That' s your mom?
Don' t you have to go when your mum calls?
Well, yeah, but...
Don' t go yet.
Let' s go see my friends first.
Then you can go.
Well, I don' t know.
Please?
Okay, I guess.
Thanks.
But soon as we' re done, I' ve got to go.
Okay.
Forward, bounce!
I know another game.
It' s called The Name Game.
Heffalumps have names?
Of course.
My name is Heffridge Trumpeter Bumpet.
Heffridge Trumpler Brompet Heffalump the Fourth.
Whoa.
How do you remember all that?
I can' t, so everybody calls me Lumpy.
Lumpy.

Heffalumps like...
Okay, so why are we hiding again?
We' re planning an ambush.
So, um...
You see any Heffalumps yet?
I know.
I' il use my famous Heffalump call to lure one over.
You have an infamous Heffalump call?
Well, of course.
All great Heffalump catchers do.
M- M- My, what a dreadful sound.
Do you suppose it might b- b- b- b- be a...
Oh, yes, Piglet.
It does sound rather Heffalumpish.
Oh, m- m- my!
Do you see it?
- That one was good.
I see a tail.
Are there horns too?
Two of them.
Oh, d- d- d- dear.
Be brave, Piglet.
This is our chance to save our woods.
And our honey.
Yes, Pooh.
I capture you!
And so did you.
Rabbit would be proud of us.
look a lot like rabbits?
And why do you think that is, Piglet?
Oh, d- d- dear.
The Heffalump knows my name.
Well, hello there, Tigger.
Did you happen to see the Heffalump I just captured?
You got me there.
{y: i} We all know frogs go...
Come on.
Let' s go.
I think I better go home now.
Why?
'Cause I' m not supposed to go in that part of the woods.
- Scary things live there.
That' s where I live.
There aren' t any scary things there.
That' s where I live.
There aren' t any scary things there.
Are too.
There' s a stripy thing that bounces, and it goes...
Then it pounces.
No, that' s Tigger.
You' re wrong about him.
He' s great.
And there' s this little pig monster that squeals and shakes all the time.
And it will get you if you don' t watch out.
Oh, no.
You' re wrong about Piglet too.
He wouldn' t hurt a fly.
And then there' s this loud thing, and it' s got long ears.
And he yells at everybody.
Yeah, you' re kind of right about Rabbit.
But he' s okay once you get to know him.
I don' t want to get to know him.
Do I have to?
Hey, you really are scared, aren' t you?
- But my friends aren' t scary.
Who told you all this stuff?
I don' t know.
Everybody knows.
That' s just what Rabbit and Tigger said about Heffalumps.
There' s nothing scary here.
Promise?
Promise.
- Roo.
- Sorry.
My fault.
Why, thank you, Tigger.
All right, no more fun and games.
The Heffalump is all but in our grasp.
Excuse me.
Are we planning another ambush?
Of course not.
We' re hiding.
H- H- How will we know w- when it' s s- safe?
Oh, m- m- my.
Well, Piglet?
Do you see it?
It' s coming!
It' s coming!
I suggest a retreat to another part of the wood.
I' m right behind you.
This way.
No, that way.
Oh, hello, Eeyore.
Goodbye, Eeyore.
I' m afraid to ask.
Hello?
Pooh Bear?
Hello?
Hello!
Anybody?
Rabbit?
I caught the Heffalump.
I mean, uh, Lumpy.
Pooh Bear?
It looks like nobody' s home.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Is that you?
Yeah.
My mum usually makes me a snack about now.
Do you have any Rumpledoodles?
- What are those?
- They' re like biscuits.
They go rather well with honey.
Wait.
That' s Pooh' s honey.
I guess he won' t mind.
Um, we better go before we break something.
This is where Rabbit lives.
Is he the one with the pointy ears?
Don' t worry.
He won' t hurt you.
They must still be out on the "expotition."
Lumpy?
Oh, yeah?
Whoa.
Missed me.
Gotcha.
My mum' s not going to like this, Rooty- toot.
Yeah.
My mom neither...... Lumpster.
We' d better get cleaned up.
- Hey, wanna play a game?
- What kind of game?
Cannonball!
{y: i} We stand shoulder to shoulder {y: i} We stand side to side {y: i} When one of us {y: i} gets a tiny bit tired {y: i} One gives the other a ride
- Can you teach me that?
- Of course.
Suck it in...... and then spray it down.
See?
Tell you what, you stick to squirting and I' il stick to bouncing.
Yup.
Are you thinking what I' m thinking?
- Yeah!
- Cloud racing!
Lumpster?
Yeah?
You' re not captured anymore.
{y: i} Song
Come on!
Come on!
You' re behind!
- Quiet!
Well, what do you know?
We' re home.
Well, well.
All in all, a successful Heffalump expedition.
- Are you sure, Rabbit?
Just look around.
You don' t see any Heffalumps, do you?
Oh, bother.
Rabbit, I don' t think it' s successful anymore.
Rabbit!
Rabbit!
Rabbit!
The Heffalumps are among us!
- We' re surrounded.
- Run for your life!
- Look for an exit!
- They got us surrounded!
- Did you hear that?
- We' re trapped!
That' s it.
Traps.
We need traps!
Everywhere!
I' il get some bait.
What?
Behold.
A super- duper, extra- looper, hunka hunka Heffatrap.
Oh, m- m- m- my.
Well, what do you know?
It catches Piglets too.
I' d like to see a Heffalump try and breach these defenses.
- It' s impressive, Rabbit.

We forgot your mom.
I really have to go.
She sounds worried.
I' il help you find her.
Thank you, Roo.
Roo!
Roo!
Mrs. Heffalump!
Mrs. Heffalump?
Mrs. Heffalump!
She' s not here, either.
We' il find her.
Let' s try that way.
Lumpster?
Are you okay?
We haven' t heard my mom in a really long time.
Do you wanna play a game?
No, thanks.
Don' t feel like games.
When I don' t feel good, my mom sings to me.
My mum sings to me too.
{y: i} So many things {y: i} we' ve got to do
I want my mum.
Me too.
Wait.
My mom.
She' il know what to do.
Come on.
Come on, Lumpy.
Let' s go back and find her.
Come on, Lumpy.
My mom will make everything okay.
Roo?
Roo!
Roo!
Oh, my goodness.
False alarm!
As in, "Never mind!"
We almost casually captivated ourselves a captive Kanga.
And that' s kind of hard to say.
What' s all this for?
We built traps to catch the Heffalump.
Clever, huh?
Please, have any of you seen Roo?
He should have been home by now.
Come on, Lumpy.
Just a little further.
Hey, look.
There she is, Lumpy.
Mom!
Roo!
This is Lumpy!
He' s a Heffalump!
A real Heffalump!
- And it' s got Roo too!
- Stop him!
- Unhand him!
- We' il save you, Roo!
Wait!
- Never mind.
- Retreat!
- Retreat!
Retreat!
- Bounce for your life!
- Charge!
- No, wait!
- Lumpy!
Lumpy!
Wait!
Don' t go!
Lumpy!
Lumpy!
Lumpy!
Roo!
Lumpy?
You said they wouldn' t be scary.
You promised.
Oh, Lumpy.
I' m so sorry.
This is all my fault.
I want my mummy.
- Roo!
- Roo!
Come on, Lumpy.
We gotta get you out of here.
Roo.
Come on.
Let' s get you back home.
- There they are!
- The Heffalump' s got him.
Drop my bouncing buddy, you Heffally- rascalump!
After it!
In the name of the Hundred Acre Wood,
- I capture you!
Lumpy!
- We did it!
- We did.
- Leave him alone!
- Wait!
You' re scaring him.
Rabbit, what on earth are you all doing?
Well, we' re rescuing Roo from the Heffalump!
No, stop.
You don' t understand.
Now, see here, Roo...
Rabbit, let him finish, please.
We were wrong about Heffalumps.
They' re not scary creatures.
Lumpy' s my friend.
He' s just like us.
- He gets afraid.
- He likes honey.
And he even learned how to bounce.
Oh, look at that.
So you' ve got to un- capture him.
But...
- Lumpy!
Lumpy!
We' re coming, dear!
- Oh, dear.
- Roo!
- Hold on, Roo!
Mom...
Mama?
Tigger.
We' il help you!
Just hang on!
Roo, I' ve got an idea!
One, two, three...
Hold on, Roo!
Pull!
Lumpy?
There, there, Piglet.
I think he' s trying to help.
- Mummy!
- Mummy?
My mummy' s coming!
Heffridge Trumpler Brompet Heffalump the Fourth, where have you been?
Oh, my little darling.
I' ve been worried sick.
I' m okay, Mummy, but my friend Roo' s in trouble.
Can' t you save him?
- Mummy, this way.
- Oh, my.
Roo, can you hear me, love?
Now, don' t be frightened.
I' m Lumpy' s mummy.
Here I am!
Right here!
- Don' t you worry, love.
Just leave it to me.
Now, now, try not to move, love.
Here I come.
Hold very still, love.
Easy does it.
Yeah!
Oh, thank goodness.
- Mama!
Mama!
Oh, Roo.
I was so worried.
Thanks, Mrs. Heffalump.
Mummy!
You did it!
You did it!
My little Roo.
Oh, Lumpy.
You' ve found your call.
Oh, Rabbit.
That' s why the Heffalump was in our wood.
She was looking for her baby.
Young...... Heffalump.
I...
That is to say, we...
Can you ever forgive us?
We' ve acted very badly.
That' s okay, Long Ears.
I like this kid already.
You' re right, Rooty- toot.
He is nice, once you get to know him.
Lumpy, darling.
We really should be going.
I have to go home now.
Goodbye, Lumpster.
Goodbye, Rooty- toot.
- Just a bit longer?
- Please?
Well...
I don' t see why not.
I suppose a few more minutes wouldn' t hurt.
- Forward, bounce!
- Wow!
Here I come!
Roo, Roo, Rooty- toot- toot.
{y: i} It was more like... {y: i}... like Lumpy {y: i} captured all of us.
{y: i} We stand shoulder to shoulder {y: i} We stand side to side {y: i} When one of us {y: i} gets a tiny bit tired {y: i} One gives the other a ride

{y: i} What do you do?
{y: i} What do you do?
Hello, Angus.
Is that really you, Bobby Jones?
Where is everybody?
My Lord.
- How have you been?
- Fine, Bobby.
Just fine.
We' re on our way to the Olympics in Berlin... and I couldn' t be this close to the Old Course....
Good Lord.
I only told one person there was a reservation for an R. Jones.
Angus, my game is....
Your game is always fine here.
Welcome back, Bobby.
- Great to see you, Bobby.
- Smile for the front page.
- You were terrific.
- Thank you, Bobby.
Watch this one, boy.
Shit fire!
You looking for this?
- I' m sorry, Camilla, I hooked it.
- You best take care... you don' t hook none of these windows in this house, young man... or your daddy will tan your hide.
- How is your tummy today?
- It' s okay.
Think you can eat some lunch for me?
I got some leftover chicken and biscuits.
I was gonna make a pie.
Okay.
- Robert, are you all right?
- Yes, Mama.
Come on in.
I want to see how much you weigh.
Look at you.
You' ve gained another pound.
Can I play baseball with Frank and Perry now?
Soon.
Poppo!
Hey!
There he is.
I have something in my pocket.
And I wonder what it could be?
You got it.
Come here.
Let' s go see your mama.
Why did you tell Camilla this is monkey year?
Not monkey year, honey.
I said it was the Year of the Monkey.
In the Chinese zodiac... each of the 12 years is named for a different animal.
So each animal contributes its own characteristics to that year.
So if you are born in that year, you take on those traits.
Like a monkey or a horse or an ox.
- What animal am l?
- You, my dearest, are a tiger.
Tigers are born leaders.
They are loners.
They have a short temper... but they go after their ambitions no matter how hard the opposition.
- What animal are you, Mama?
- I' m a dragon.
- Can you breathe fire?
- Yes, I can.
Especially if I find out... you' ve been playing with Frank Meador while he' s still coughing.
You are my little man.
I don' t want anything bad to happen to you.
Don' t worry, Mama.
I' m a tiger.
- Good night.
- Good night, dear.
You' re a frightful long ways from Carnoustie.
And my ass is painful to prove it.
It' s a beautiful course.
And some nice people, too.
Free with their money.
- Can any of them play?
- Not really.
If they could, they wouldn' t need you, would they?
They make their whiskey out of corn here.
- You' re joking.
- No, I' m not.
We' re gonna miss you, Jimmy.
It' s great that your brother could take your place.
It' s an honor to have him here.
So, Stewart, what do you think about my stance?
Go on.
You cannot keep it in the policies, you' re craving for the byre.
Come more down on the left hand.
Shit fire!
Show him, Stewy.
Baseball was my game.
I had a contract after I graduated from Georgia... with the Brooklyn Trolley Dodgers.
But my father put the quietus on it.
Threatened to disown me.
- I went to law school instead.
- Good idea.
Probably.
Is that lad touched in the head?
- Wee Bobby?
- Yeah.
No, he' s just sickly.
He nearly died as a baby.
Couldn' t eat, he' s allergic to everything.
They just bring him along for the exercise.
Dirty rotten bastard!
Oh, dear.
Good afternoon, Camilla.
Are you here by yourself?
Yes, Mr. Jones, they are all yonder playing golf.
Ought to be back directly.
Playing golf on the Sabbath.
Blasphemous.
Won' t you have a seat and wait?
Let me get you a Coca- Cola.
There' s nothing in the Bible about Coca- Cola.
I will not permit it in my house.
- Just bring me a glass of cold water, please.
- Yes, sir.
Coming right up.
Golf.
Big Bob.
Those cost 20 cents apiece.
- Great round, Stewart.
Terrific.
- Thank you.
Well done.
Tell me, Mr. Maiden, how did they decide... that there should be 18 holes in a round of golf?
Ma' am, a long time ago at St. Andrew' s... they had a meeting to try and figure that out.
One of the clan stood up and said:
"There' s 18 shots in a bottle of whiskey...
"and I reckon when the bottle' s empty, the round is done."
Grandpa!
Be careful.
Hello, Bobby.
Son, you are growing like a weed.
- You get bigger every time I see you.
- Papa, how nice of you to visit.
I had to come up on business.
Meeting some buyers here from New York in the morning.
Is this the way you spend your Sabbath?
- Setting a bad example for your son?
- Getting Little Bob outdoors... has done wonders for his health.
Excuse me, Papa, I have to go inside and change.
Come along, Robert.
Go upstairs and dress for dinner.
You spend so much time playing golf out there, I can' t help but wonder... if it' s for your son' s health or your own amusement.
Papa, I meet my biggest clients here.
And why?
Because I play golf with Asa Kindler and Bob Woodruff.
So you' re telling me that it' s not your merit as a lawyer... that' s advancing your career?
How encouraging.
Grandpa, look at my windmill.
I built it myself.
That' s just fine, Bobby.
Maybe you' il grow up to be an engineer... and not fritter away your time playing worthless ball games.
Son of a bitch!
Isn' t that your house over there?
I bet your poor mother' s missing you.
Don' t you think?
Go on, now.
Go home.
Red, do you have to play golf?
- What about me?
- Take two weeks off from the game.
And then give it up altogether.
What can I do for you, laddie?
- What are those?
- 20 cents apiece.
Did you get any of them while they were still rolling?
No, sir.
Cheeky wee rascal, right enough.
- Good morning.
- It is.
You know, I was thinking... if wee Bobby' s gonna be tagging about... he may as well play a bit, if he can keep up, that is.
I made him a few clubs.
Wee Bobby, hit the hell out of it.
Bobby.
Hey!
Bobby, wake up.
Come on, Bobby, he started at six.
That' s him, that' s Harry Vardon.
Five British Opens.
Did you see that?
Aren' t you children supposed to be in school?
It has been my impression if you shoot over 100, you have no business playing.
If you shoot under 80, you have no business.
Rob, why don' t you show us all how Stewart Maiden hits the ball?
Go ahead, son.
Yeah, pretty good?
Now why don' t you show us how Judge Broyles swings?
Son of a bitch!
Little Bob.
You want to play with us?
We tee off in 10 minutes.
You go ahead, son.
- Be careful out there, now.
- Thanks.
You see, Colonel?
Thank you.
Keep the change.
- How you doing, Milt?
- O. B. How are you, sir?
Who' s your opponent?
Oh, my.
- He' s just a boy.
- It' s embarrassing, O. B.
They mustn' t let children play in adult tournaments.
Now on the tee, Mr. Milt Saul... and Mr. Robert Tyre Jones, Jr.
Mr. Jones, you have honors.
- Would you like to go first?
- No, you go ahead, son.
Good grief.
What a swing.
Little Bob Jones, a tow- headed boy from East Lake Golf Club... was born on St. Patrick' s Day.
But luck is not an issue... when you have a golf swing that can only be described as heavenly.
I' m going on record.
Bobby Jones is destined for greatness.
"Dixie Whiz Kid Lights Up Georgia Amateur."
By O. B. Keeler.
Sheer delicatessen.
The winner of the Georgia State Amateur Championship... is Mr. Bobby Jones.
- Congratulations, Bobby.
- Bob.
- Congratulations, Bob.
I believe your boys are ready to play in the US Amateur.
The US Amateur?
Play, Colonel, I didn' t say I expected them to win.
"Half a league, half a league Half a league onward
"Forward, the Light Brigade"
"Was there a man dismay' d
"Not tho 'the soldier knew Some one had blunder' d
"Theirs not to reason why Theirs but to do or die"
He gets that from his mother.
What are you doing?
You gonna play in those?
I thought your dad bought you new shoes.
I have my four- leaf clover, too.
We' re gonna need some luck.
Look who' s in this field.
The current US Open champ... three former Amateur champs, two NCAA champs... - and us.
- I heard the greens were like billiard tables.
Bent grass.
It' s like putting on ice.
You try to just tap your ball in and it slides all the way across the green.
It' s 18 holes, boys, just like home.
Come on, now.
Let' s go get registered.
- Excuse me.
Thank you.
- Why, of course.
Now on the tee, former Amateur Champion...
Mr. Eben Byers.
Remember what old Bob Fitzsimmons used to say?
"The bigger they are, the harder they fall."
Next up, Georgia State Champion...
Mr. Robert Tyre Jones, Jr.
Shit!
Damn!
Son of a bitch!
Damn it to hell!
Bobby Jones.
Shit fire!
God!
Son of a bitch!
- What a kid.
- Face of an angel.
The temper of a timber wolf.
Leave the damn thing.
Would you like some gum, Mr. Byers?
Congratulations.
That was quite a match, son.
Mr. Byers and I both played terribly.
He just ran out of clubs before I did.
Come on, let' s call your dad.
If he keeps playing like this, I' m telling you, he could win this thing.
I' ve never seen anyone putt like this.
That was quite a round you played this morning.
- You have a beautiful swing.
- Thank you.
- You like ice cream?
- Yes, sir.
They give you as much as you want.
- Have a good time this afternoon.
This is really fun.
Good morning.
Bob, that gentleman you were just talking to... that' s Grantland Rice, the sportswriter.
He writes for American Golfer.
He likes my swing.
- Go get him.
- You have quite a following.
- I can' t help it.
- Good luck to you.
- Good luck to you, sir.
And now on the tee...
Mr. Robert Tyre Jones, Jr.
Next on the tee, Mr. Robert Gardner.
"All square at the tenth.
"There came three holes in succession that broke the kid' s heart.
"But the Georgia schoolboy swung along in his worn shoes and dusty pants...
"whistling an air from a recent musical comedy...
"as jaunty as if he had won his first national championship...
"instead of just having been beaten in the third round.
"He was thinking about his ice cream."
- How you doing?
- Fine, thank you, sir.
- Mr. Keeler.
- You can call me O. B.
- What are you reading, son?
- Just some stuff they wrote about me.
They make it sound like I didn' t mind losing.
I did mind.
I was mad as hell.
I know you were mad.
I was there, I saw it.
A will to win, that' s very important.
Why do they care about what I wear?
They even made fun of my shoes.
That' s the price of fame, son.
I' m afraid you have to get used to it.
- I don' t think I want to be famous.
- It' s too late now.
Rob, all these people, our club members, our friends... they expect a great deal of you now.
Everybody here will be watching every match you play.
- But I lost.
- ln the future, you' il win.
You' ve shown everyone just what you' re capable of.
You understand?
- Robert, he' s just a child.
- Yes, Clara... but he' s our child.
Son of a bitching bastard.
I can' t believe you just did that.
You could have hurt someone.
I threw it over their heads.
It was a simple shot, I' ve done it a million times.
There are some emotions, Alexa... that cannot be endured with a golf club still in your hands.
You know, that man paid $1, 500 to caddy for you.
These people paid good money to see you play.
- They paid to see all of us play -- - No, Bob, they came to see you.
- I' m not a star.
You' re the US Amateur Champion.
I haven' t done anything.
But you' re gonna do something, and they know it.
Everybody knows it.
As soon as you get out of your own way.
Tough luck, sport.
This isn' t our day, Bob.
He' il never make it over that tree.
Showoff.
I told you, you were a star.
- I don' t want to be a star.
- Tell them.
Way to go, Bobby!
- Here he comes.
- Sir Walter has arrived.
- I heard he' s quite the raconteur.
- And then some.
He' s broken all 1 1 of the Ten Commandments.
Mr. Hagen?
They are waiting for you.
- Where is she?
- I took her to her home of residence.
- Where was l?
- Right there where you are now sitting.
Hagen, let' s go already.
Genius deserves patience, my friend.
I' m afraid I' m a trifle soft in the treasury.
In case you have not been hearing, so is most of this entire world.
You still owe me two 20s and one 10 from last week.
And you have not been paying rent on this motorcar.
This is a charity function.
If I don' t make some side bets, we go broke.
Good man.
Morning, Chick.
Where you been, Walter?
Practicing a few shots?
No, but I' ve been having a few.
Young Mr. Jones, I presume.
- I' m Walter Hagen.
- I know who you are.
- How do you do?
- Better than most, son.
I assume I have the honors.
On the tee, US Open Champion, Walter Hagen.
He swings like a wounded duck.
Just don' t bet money with him.
They don' t call him Sir Walter for nothing.
Nice putt.
Two threes in a row.
18 threes make 54.
Next hole.
Shit fire and damnation!
Mashie.
I think we' re in trouble.
I asked my wife what she wanted for Christmas.
She said a divorce.
I said I wasn' t thinking of anything that expensive.
Excuse me.
- You have quite a game.
- I played awful.
I never hit a good shot after you mentioned that 54.
All I made was fives.
There' s a lesson there.
I don' t care if I start out with four fives.
I simply figure I' ve used up my quota, and I forget about them.
And I go on.
I don' t always hit the ball straight.
But you know what I' ve learned?
Three bad shots and one good one still make par.
Golf is a game of recovery.
You' re gonna make one hell of a pro.
You got that swing, and you got the name.
Crowd loves you.
With the war ending, the tournaments will start up again, and sky' s the limit.
I' m not gonna turn pro.
I signed up for Georgia Tech this fall.
Really?
School is nice, I guess... but isn' t the point of it all to make a nice, big bag of money?
Not just.
I want to get an education.
I think that' s important.
Can I ask you a question?
Why do you play golf?
And I want to win.
Do you know why I play golf?
For the money.
I have to win.
I' m gonna beat you.
I' il beat you.
Thank you.
- Hello, George.
- Good morning, Mary.
- May I have a Coca- Cola, please?
- You surely may.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
These are the worst conditions I' ve ever seen.
Have some coffee.
Thanks.
Brought some local papers there.
What are they saying?
A lot of the folks are picking us to win... even though this Herron fellow is a member here.
They say Rob' s strokes are absolutely brilliant.
His "smoldering wrath," as one of them called it.
I don' t know what I' il do with him.
- What am I gonna say to him?
The way I see it, he' s trying to please you, his mother... and the whole damn city of Atlanta.
Throwing clubs may be the only thing he has to relieve the pressure.
Where is he now?
He' s making a telephone call.
His mother?
I don' t think so.
Alexa?
No.
It' s a couple more days and then we' il take the train back home.
I can' t wait to see you again.
Is your father still sitting there?
Yes.
I' m sorry... about your bad weather, that is.
- I hope it changes soon.
- Me, too.
When I get back I thought maybe you' d like to come to dinner.
Meet my folks.
Yes, that would be real nice.
I' d better go.
Yes, you, too.
Yes, me, too.
Goodbye.
Robert Jones?
- Yes, Daddy.
- I don' t know him.
He goes to Tech.
- He knows Matt and John.
- ls he Catholic?
- Daddy -- - ls he?
- No, he isn' t.
- What have I told you about that?
You told me:
"Judge not, lest ye be judged."
And where is he that the weather is so bad?
- You were listening to my conversation?
- I' m sitting right here.
He' s playing a golf tournament.
In Oakmont, Pennsylvania, if you must know.
- The US Amateur?
- Yes.
That was Bobby Jones on the telephone?
He prefers Bob.
- ls he winning?
- He' s in the finals.
O. B., he' s gonna win this damn thing.
I can feel it.
A national championship.
Quiet.
Fore!
- What in the hell are you doing?
- Somebody moved.
- Are you mad?
- It' s all right.
Now boarding, Track Three, Local, Homestead...
Richvale, Rankin, Bradley.
Don' t tell your old man.
I guess this is your runner- up year.
You' ve come second in four tournaments in a row.
- That megaphone.
- The megaphone didn' t beat me.
Davey Herron did.
I lost 13 pounds in that match, O. B. 13 pounds.
I can play 36 holes in the hot sun at home... and never lose but a pound or two.
I' ve just got to learn to manage it better.
You know what Will Rogers said:
"Good judgment comes from experience...
"and a lot of that comes from bad judgment."
It' s true.
I never learned anything from a tournament I won.
"lf you can keep your head when all about you
"Are losing theirs
"lf you can meet with triumph and disaster
"And treat those two impostors just the same"
"lf you can fill the unforgiving minute
"With sixty seconds' worth of distance run
"Yours is the Earth and everything that' s in it"
"And which is more
"you will be a Man my son"
Hell, just keep it.
- Hi, Bobby.
- Hello.
- Who' s that?
- I have no idea.
- Hello, everybody.
- Hey, Bobby.
- This is Mary Malone.
- Hi.
- Mary.
Alexa.
- Nice to meet you.
How do you do?
- Do you play golf, Mary?
- No, I don' t.
Well, gang, today is January 15, 1920.
Remember it well.
It is the last day we can drink legally.
- There' s no way Prohibition can last.
- I read an article in Vanity Fair.
It said we' re going on "the gaudiest spree in history."
They call this the Jazz Age.
- Here' s to jazz, then.
- And opera.
- And Georgia Tech golf.
- And friends.
- Hi, Bobby.
- Hello.
We' re having a party at our house.
You want to come by?
I' m with someone.
Thank you.
What' s your girlfriend' s name?
We could call her Marigold, because that' s what she' s trying to do.
- Are you sure she' s your type?
- That' s enough.
She doesn' t drink, she doesn' t pet, she hasn' t been to college yet.
Bobby Jones!
- I want to buy you a drink.
- I have one, thank you.
- What you drinking?
- It looks like beer.
- Waitress!
- Excuse me.
Waitress, two beers.
- Mary!
Go after her.
- Wait.
- Let me go.
- No.
- I' m going home.
I don' t play golf.
I don' t go to college and I don' t drink.
- lf that' s what you want -- - I don' t care about any of that.
I didn' t know you were famous when I met you.
I just knew that you were sweet.
Maybe you need to find somebody who can --
I have found somebody.
Bonny Bobby, is it?
- My name' s Angus.
I' il be your caddy.
- It' s a pleasure to meet you, Angus.
That' s Harry Vardon.
- Mr. Vardon, I' m Bob Jones.
- How do you do?
It' s a dream come true... to play with you here at the Open.
I saw you at an exhibition at the East Lake Golf Club when I was a boy.
- Yeah.
Now on the tee, from the United States Amateur...
Robert Tyre Jones, Jr.
Bitch.
Mr. Vardon, you ever seen a worse shot than that?
No.
But I really wanted to
- I wanted to give you something - But why do you have to give me anything?
Because you gave me a lot Ramon, you have no idea
Has it been that bad?
Now, I don' t want to complicate things
I know that the problem must be me, right
That men don' t like me or something
What are you saying, Rosa?
How is that even possible?
Wasn' t that what you told me when I came here the first time?
Frustrated woman, you said
Yes, yes.
If I called you that then, now I call you strong and brave and kind and beautiful.
And I call assholes those who can' t see it
Rosa, please stop it.
You make me feel like a priest and I hate them enough already
Sit over here, come on sit.
And leave my hand alone, you know I can' t feel it
My son says you are faking it.
I wish I could help you.
You would help me?
Don' t worry.
I have it all planned so that no one ends up in jail
I have some friends that are willing to help
I only need one more.
No.
Help you heal... not die
Come on guys, let' s go.
Are you holding him?
He won' t fit through here
Ramon says that he understands the situation but that he won' t come down
Ok.
It doesn' t matter.
Brother Andres
Go upstairs and tell Ramon
... and since we are inside eternity.
Life doesn' t belong to us... and we take to ridiculous extremes the bourgeois definition of private property
You are killing me
But if Church was the first one in secularizing the private property
- I can' t tell him that - How come?
Should I tell him that?
Freedom to choose my beliefs... no, his beliefs and decide over his life
Ok, now you tell him
Why does the Church keep that posture of terror of death with such passion?
Because it knows that it would lose a great amount of its customers if people lose their fear to the Great Beyond
He reminds you that according to the polls, 67% of the Spanish are in favor of euthanasia
Very well, very well.
Now you tell him that moral issues are not resolved through polls
Because most of the German people were also in favor of Hitler
Now he is going to compare me to Hitler.
That is very rude
No, not that
Ask him what Hitler has to do with all this
No wait...
Padre Francisco, do you hear me?
Ramon I can hear you
Why do you mix pears with apples?
I hope you didn' t come here to do demagoguery.
Because you Jesuits know a lot about that.
No, no.
Of course not.
But since you bring up demagoguery, my dear Ramon.
Don' t you think that what' s really demagogic, is to say "Death with dignity"
Why don' t you leave the euphemisms aside and call things by its name, with all its rawness
"I take my life" and that' s it...
Your interest in me keeps surprising me, while the institution that you represent accepts the death penalty and condemned those who didn' t think the right way, to the bonfire for centuries
Now you are the one doing demagoguery
Yes of course, but leaving the euphemisms aside, as you say that' s what you would have done with me, right?
Burn me alive
Burn me for defending my freedom
Ramon, my friend...
Friend?
Ramon, my friend.
A freedom that eliminates life is not freedom
And a life that eliminates freedom is not life either
Don' t call me friend!
And leave me alone
Come on.
Let' s go
You... you who look like kind people, give this man reasons to live
Prove to him that life is not only moving your arms and running around or kicking a ball.
Damn it!
Life is something else, really
Life is so much more.
Hear it from me
And what do you want us to do?
That we gag him so he doesn' t talk?
Or that we put him to sleep with a rattle like a little kid
Look. you appeared on TV and said something that I can' t get out of my head
Manuela, leave it alone
You said that Ramon' s family didn' t give him enough love... you should know that in this house no one stopped loving Ramon for one single day
Not one day
I' ve been looking after him for many years and I love him like a son
I don' t know which one of you is right
And I don' t know if it' s true what you say about life belonging to God and not to us but I do know one thing you have a very big mouth
Rosa, I told you that it' s not necessary.
I already shaved Ramon
Yes, yes.
But I know a better way
Where do you have the soap?
They' re here
I don' t feel anything.
Are you sure there' s a child in there?
7 months old, darling
- Well, he' s not moving - You' re the one that doesn' t move
- Now, now, now - See
- He' s happy to see you - How are you going to call him?
We still don' t know
Well, call him Ramon so that way one day when he asks why, you can tell him my story
It' s better if you tell him
There' s someone else who will be really happy to see you
- No, no.
Not like that - Grandpa, shut up
- How come you didn' t say anything?
- We wanted to surprise you
This a great Wise Men' s day present
I' m going to open the windows, it' s really hot in here
We better get out and leave you alone for a while
How are you sailor?
- Do you drink coffee Marc?
- Yes, please
- How are you Rosa?
- Fine
Ramon told me that you found a new job
Yes, caring for elderly people
Is that woman going to stay long?
A couple of weeks, depending on how long the book takes
Well, I guess I won' t be able to shave him.
See you some other time
Bye Rosa
Ok, the judges have their hands tied because of the legislation
We are going to try to obtain a statement where we recommend the government changes to the penal code
- The government?
- The government is there to serve us, Javi
Your uncle is more important
The jury will not dare to agree with us, we already know that
But we can not fail on the regional audience
Javier, help me with the cows
We have to convince the judges that Ramon is completely sane and lucid
It would help us a lot if he writes a declaration
Manuela, we have to take Ramon out of the house
Can you tell me what you were doing in there?
Do you know what they are talking about?
What they want?
And what do I do?
Lock myself up in my room?
Do you understand what they really want?
What happens if he wins the trial?
Your uncle gets injected and dies, like a dog.
And you' il never see him again
You will never see him again, Javier
Or do you think death is so great?
Please use your head
Death is a very serious thing, you hear me?
- Your uncle dies and you won' t see him again - Leave me alone
It' s not that he doesn' t feel like it, he just doesn' t want to use the chair
Taking him out of the house once or twice a year is an accomplishment
Well, this has to be one of those times.
It is very important that Ramon takes this trip.
And when would that be?
I estimate that the trial will take place in the spring
So we still have time to propose it to him
There' s only one thing worse than the death of a son that he wants to die
Well, let' s get to work
"... get inside of you, eternally, my seduced lover, beloved sea"
Can you really smell the sea from here?
Yes, and sometimes in the morning if there' s wind and the window is open, I can smell it as if I was there
You have a very good nose
Smells are probably what cause me to have more intense sensations
More fantasies
... your smell, for example.
My smell
Yes, it' s the first thing I imagine when I day dream about you
Really?
- And what are those dreams about?
- Just things
They all have one thing in common...
In all of them I can move... and I stand up and travel wherever I imagine you are at that moment
And if I imagine that you are here, for example
I just get close to you
And do what I have been wishing to do so many times
Then your smell becomes stronger and I get dizzy
I can feel your heart beat, then I feel your hands
And then I lose my mind...
I lose my mind
Is the water ok?
Julia...
Julia, are you awake?
Yes
I can' t sleep
Why is that
I have an itch on my leg, can you come and scratch it?
... the leg
I brought him some "filloas"
- I know he likes them - Rosa, please listen - I made them
I' ve told you that you don' t have to cook him anything, or bathe him or shave him.
Nothing
I take care of Ramon.
Get it?
- Ok, then I want to hear it from him - No, he already told me
Besides, he is very busy now
Is he with her?
I wish I was a lawyer too.
But of course...
- Don' t cry Rosa, don' t cry - If you don' t want to see me, please tell me
- Of course I want to see you - It doesn' t look that way
Really, what are you...
Rosa...
Rosa...
She hung up
Do you mind dialing the number again and giving me a minute alone
What' s going on between you two, Ramon?
But Julia...
Why would I need to explain anything to you?
I don' t understand why you answer me like that, because then I don' t know what I' m doing here.
Unless of course, you think that there' s nothing happening here
The kiss you gave me yesterday meant nothing?
Look at you
Look at you sitting there
Look at you
And now look at me
Where are we going Julia?
Look at us
I haven' t finished
What do you think?
That I don' t think about what happened to me?
Of course, I think about it.
Frequently
Every single day.
It' s like a nightmare
And I know that it will only get worse and worse until I end up like a vegetable
So I have reached a conclusion and I rather...
I' m going to do it Ramon
I' m going to take my own life
But before I do it, if you want to, my love...
I would like to help you
Leave together...
You don' t say anything?
You didn' t expect this
When?
I don' t know.
We are almost done with the book and...
I' il go to Barcelona and look for an editor so you can publish it.
And then I' il come back with the first copy.
That same day, Ramon.
That same day.
Listen to me, in the worst case scenario we would win the public support.
If the verdict is negative the discussion will be more heated
- Don' t be stupid...
I can' t understand...
- Are you ok?
- Yes, Yes
News, what news?
Marc, please be careful.
It' s ok, it' s ok.
What happened Ramon?
We are here.
I understand Ramon, I understand.
But that doesn' t matter
Listen to me, if no one takes this step.
If everyone hides their heads and doesn' t even try to confront the state, the judges...
And what do we do now Manuela?
I mean, with the trip to Corunna.
Do I go there and waste my time?
Knowing that they won' t listen to me
Well, I think that today it is a waste of time but maybe tomorrow it could be useful for someone else
Let' s go and see those judges in person
- Javi, where is the chair - The chair?
I don' t know, it' s probably in the back
Well, I want you to take it out and clean it up.
Then bring grandpa and I' il explain.
We are going to make some changes
Are going to install a motor?
- You have to cut here and here - Let the back move, right?
You have to cut these pipes down here and then join them with bolts so they move as hinges.
Are you getting this?
- Yes, yes - And you dad?
You' re going to be lying down son.
You might fall asleep at the trial
Is not like they' re saying anything interesting, dad.
Die to Live
LETTERS FROM HELL
You should put a pillow here to support my head
In case I fall backwards and break my neck
Hey, Javi.
Do you get it?
Break my neck...
Grandpa
Look, if you' re going to help me like that, it' s better if you do nothing
- Am I tying you too tight?
- You' re asking me?
Wait a moment please.
Ramon
Manuela, please.
As if I don' t look ridiculous enough
Better this than catching a cold
And don' t you dare, taking it off
You are Ramon Sampedro, right?
I' m really glad I' m taking you there
Living is a right, not an obligation!
- Look at all the people here - Who did we kill, eh?
Ramon, do you feel alone because you are the only Spanish to have requested euthanasia?
Yes, well, the first one in requesting it in a public manner.
But this has been happening for many years.
What do you expect from the judges?
What are you going to tell them?
I just want to tell them that I' m completely sane and lucid
Silence
Can we talk later?
Silence, please
In a state declared as law and that recognizes the right to the private property and which constitution expresses also the right not to suffer tortures or degrading treatments is correct to say, that whomever sees his position as degrading, as in Ramon Sampedro' s case, should be able to decide over his own life in fact, no one who attempts suicide and survives is judged afterwards but... when you need the help of someone else to die with dignity, then the state interferes with the freedom of the people and tells them that the life they are living is not theirs, that they can' t make decisions about it
This, Your Honor, can only be done based on metaphysical beliefs, or religions
In a state, I repeat... that is declared law
Your Honor, I ask for a legal answer, but above all, rational and humane
And now, with your permission, Ramon Sampedro would like to read something
Overruled
My client wants to address you directly so you can hear from his own voice...
You know the process perfectly well
Of course I know it, I know it perfectly
But I didn' t know that it was so irrelevant for you to give three minutes of your time
Three...
To listen to a man that has been waiting for 28 years
If you want to change the process... change the laws
Yes, of course.
I know that already
This case is ready for a sentence
Well... I knew you were not going to take it seriously
That' s what all men do.
Laugh at me.
You were not going to be different
Rosa, forgive me.
It' s just that lately a little of everything happens to me
- And... I' m a little overwhelmed - Why?
It' s not allowed to fall in love with a tetraplegic or what?
Is it that weird?
Well, maybe we should clear up some things.
Especially if we are talking about something as complex as love.
- Complex?
- Yes Rosa, complex
No matter how much you tell me that you love me, I will never be sure of how real your love is or if it' s just an idealization of a man you wanted to find but couldn' t or didn' t last
But what are you talking about Ramon?
Don' t try to confuse me
Either you love or you don' t.
You can' t rationalize love
Well, if that' s the case, what do you want me to do?
You want me to move in with you?
For me it' s enough to know that I can visit you from time to time
Of course you can.
Of course you can
Yes, but for how long?
Rosa.
You wouldn' t ask me to stay alive for you, right?
What if I told you that...
that you give me strength to live Ramon
Wait wait.
Stop this thing for a moment
Sit over there.
- Let' s see.
Do you love your children?
- Of course I do.
Well, there you have the strength to live
Don' t give me that responsibility Rosa
Is that what you call love?
Keep me here against my will?
Look...
The person that really loves me is the one who will help me die
That is love, Rosa
{y: i} Dear Julia... yesterday I received the sentence of the provincial audience {y: i} the judges understand that I want to die, but remind me that helping me, would be punishable by law {y: i} ln other times, this would have affected me a lot {y: i} Pushing me into that alley without exit where days and nights never end {y: i} But now I feel that everything is rushing by and that the publication of the book will happen any day now
{y: i} And with that you will return Julia.
My Juliet... {y: i} It will be the sweetest death that I could ever imagine {y: i} It will be love, pure and shared {y: i} And it will be the return to balance.
Finally to balance {y: i} A kiss, my dear friend
Ok, see you later
Should I open it?
It' s the book!
Look, it' s the book.
You are on the cover
It smells great
It' s for you
I' m going to show it to mom
Why... why... why can' t I be happy with this life?
I' m going to give you a tranquilizer
Why do I want to die?
Why do I want to die?
Give me two more Manuela.
Manuela, for crying out loud, two more pills are not going to kill me
Give me two more
You' il feel better soon
- How do you feel?
- Fine
What time is it?
11: 00 am.
I didn' t want to wake you up today
The girl from Boiro has called three times already
What did she want?
She says she has to talk to you about something important
- For her it is always important - Dial the number for me please
Are you going to call her?
Why don' t you wait for her to call back?
She can barely pay her phone bill.
Dial the number please
Of course Ramon.
You' re always so kind
- Ramon?
- What' s going on Rosa?
I need to see you.
I have to talk to you
- You said I should call you before visiting you - Yes.
Did something happen?
Can I come now?
Look Ramon, you said you had a plan or something
That you had figured out a way of doing what you want to do, if the judges decided against you
Yes, Rosa, but I already asked you to forgive me, right?
I told you to forget about it
Yes.
But I can' t
I can' t, you know
Because last month the audience said no.
And you are still thinking about doing it
Is that what worries you?
That I get my way?
- So, are you going to do it?
- Is not that easy, Rosa.
But don' t worry
You will be the last person to find out
Ramon...
It' s that I realized...
I understood what you said in Corunna.
"The person that really loves me will be the one to help me"
I' m completely sure about what I feel Ramon
I love you
Do you want me to help you?
Rosa...
I' m not joking Ramon.
Do you want me to help you?
But what are you going to tell him?
Jose wait...
Did you hear me!
I will not allow this
And what are you going to do?
Strap me to the bed?
Or are you going to fill me with sleeping pills like they used to do at the hospital?
- No one is going to prevent me from getting out of here - I will
- Not even you - I will
We' il see about that!
Or is it that I mean nothing in this house?
I am the older brother I am the head of the family
Do you think that means anything to me?
For me what counts is what people have in their heads, and you have nothing in yours
I will not be a slave of your ignorance anymore or of your prude conscience
And what about me?
I am also a slave
How do you think I felt when I left the sea?
All my life here, living out of this fucking orchard
To be with you.
To only be with you
Me, my wife and my son.
All slaves!
- Hello - Hello
- Your uncle is going to Boiro - Boiro?
What for?
To spend some time there, he says
He' s leaving with that woman, Rosa
- Are they getting married?
What' s that about you leaving?
For how long?
I want to give you my book.
It' s over there
- Aren' t there any more copies, or what?
- Yes of course, but that one is the first copy
Open it at the bookmark
- "To my son"?
- Yes.
Read it please
To my son
Forgive me my son for not being born
It wasn' t my fault to leave you behind
It were the roses, the ones afraid
Forgive me for not being able to play with you
I don' t know if you were born after I passed away
Always remember that I still love you
Give a kiss to your mother from me
And don' t keep any resentments towards me
Is not good to hate
So... did you get it?
- Yes - Let' s see
Well, it' s about a son you never had and this is like you are speaking to him
And you ask for forgiveness for not having him
Ok.
But what did I add down there?
- "To Javier" - So?
- So what?
Don' t you see what I' m trying to say?
But I' m not your son
Of course not...
But if I' m dedicating you that poem, it' s for a reason, no?
But I' m not your son
I don' t know what it is that they teach you at school.
Get out of here.
Get out.
You are all so weird
Ramon?
How are you?
Wait a moment, I can' t hear you
- Tell me dear - I' m leaving tomorrow
Yes, Rosa told me this afternoon.
I' m sure you are impatient
A little
Hey Ramon, I' ve been researching about that thing you know...
- What?
- Well that thing...
- The powder?
Yes, the powder.
You have to calculate an exact dose of 200 mg.
But it is probable that it is a little painful... just so you know
Gené.
I think it' s best if you forget about all this.
It worries me that someday you could be implicated in this
In fact, that' s why I' m calling, I want to say good bye and we shouldn' t talk again
It' s for your own security.
You shouldn' t even talk to Marc about this.
- Yes, yes.
I understand.
So this is farewell - It' s better this way
Ok, ok... ok.
Let me tell you something...
Ramon, think it through as much as necessary.
Don' t feel pressured.
I mean, don' t do it to set an example or to not disappoint the public, or us or the association
No one is pushing you to do it, do you understand me?
- Do you understand me Ramon?
- Not you too, Gené, please
- I' m sorry Ramon - Goodbye Gené
Have a nice journey, my friend
Good bye Manuela...
and you Javi, please be good
I understood what you meant with the poem
Come here a moment
Give me a hug
Do me a favour.
Take care of your grandpa
Well Ramon, here we go
Can you close the door, kid?
Come on, close it
What are you going to do in Boiro chief?
I' m going to the beach.
For a change of view
A change of view?
That' s great
This is the best I could find with the money you gave me
And I told them about the view.
Do you like it?
- Where do I sign?
- What for?
- To marry you.
He fell asleep
Of course.
Since I don' t move at all
If there' s really life after death...
I know this is going to sound foolish, but...
- Please give me a sign...
- A sign?
Anything.
I was never scared of spirits.
I will be very alert.
Waiting.
Will you do it?
Of course.
But, between you and me, I think that after we die there' s nothing.
Just like before we are born.
Nothing
How can you be so sure Ramon?
No one knows that
No I' m not sure.
It' s just a feeling.
It' s like when my father looks at the sky and says "Tomorrow it' s going to rain" and it does
It' s a feeling.
But there' s something you shouldn' t forget.
I' m going to be in your dreams
I' m going to come to your bed at night and we will make love
And in case I don' t tell you in your dreams I' il tell you now
Thank you Rosa, from the bottom of my heart.
Thanks
What does dignity mean to you?
{y: i} Whatever the answer of your conscience is, know that for me, this is not a worthy life.
{y: i} I would have liked to at least die with dignity {y: i} Today, tired of the institutional laziness, I see myself forced to do it in hiding, like a criminal {y: i} You should know that the processes conducting to my death {y: i} have been carefully divided in small actions that do not constitute a crime by themselves {y: i} and have been executed by several friendly hands {y: i} if even then, the state insists in punishing my helpers {y: i} I would suggest that you cut their hands, because that is all they contributed
The head, I mean the conscience, was provided by me
As you can see, at my side I have a glass of water that contains a dose of potassium cyanide when I drink it I will cease to exist relinquishing my most precious property.
I believe that living is a right not an obligation, as has been in my case forced to accept this sad situation during 28 years, 4 months and some days
After all this time I make a balance of the road traveled and I can' t account for the happiness
Only the time that passed against my will, during most of my life will be my ally from now on
Only time and the evolution of consciences will decide one day if my request was reasonable or not.
Well...
It' s hot...
- And Marc, is he coming?
- He is on the beach with our son.
He loves the sea
- They can' t be thinking about getting in - No!
It' s too cold
- How are you?
- Fine
- Will she understand me?
- Yes...
- I mean, does she still follow conversations and such - Yes, yes.
Sometimes it' s a little difficult, but..
- Well...
I' il go see her, see you later - See you later
Hello Julia

Head ashore, sailor.
Aye, aye, sir.
Head ashore!
I don' t know, but I' ve been told!
Coast Guard kids got lots of soul!

- By two minutes.
You know, when I was an ensign, I always had the bottom bunk.
- Did the guy above you wet his bed?
- Good point.
- Sound off - Three, four
Do they have girls' boxing at our new school?
I hope not.
Does not complaining about the move from san Diego... count as my good deed for today?
I' d sign off on that.
Admiral, this is our 12th move in my lifetime.
I admire your record- keeping, Harry.
First- rate ship' s log.
William, what have you got there?
Academy applications, sAT forms, Capitol Hill summer internship forms... and the number of the girl two houses down.
- Outstanding.
- One, two. - so that' s Christina Beardsley.
- Christina!
The zip is 06320.
Christina, we have just moved here.
Who could you possibly be talking to?
J. Crew.
I wanna make sure they change all my shipping information.
- Sound off - Three, four
Well, Mrs. Munion, what do you think of Connecticut?
I' m delighted to be here in the birthplace of Lyme disease.
I see we' re not unpacking our suitcase again.
Not until you guarantee this is our last move.
You' re gonna like New London, Harry.
I used to live here when I was a kid.
- You were a kid?
- Yeah.
Hey, I didn' t hear anything about that guarantee.
Well, son, you know the life of a military brat.
New places, new adventures.
This isn' t our last move, is it?
No, this is just one stopover on our way to D. C. someday our dad is gonna be...
Commandant of the entire U. s.
Coast Guard. someday I am gonna be... the Commandant of the entire U. s.
Unpack your suitcase.
Yes, sir.
Admiral, look at that!
Fiona, come back!
Fiona, you' re not supposed to eat pizza!
- It looks like fun.
Come back!
Oh, Max, I' m so excited.
If you get me this private line at saks Fifth Avenue...
I will love you forever.
This is cute, huh?
Yes, thank you.
This one is great.
I should really get going if I' m gonna make that meeting.
I' m sorry.
Do you have to keep doing that?
It' s in my soul.
Don' t look at the camera.
Naoko, just back off a little bit.
Give him a little room.
- Do a master shot, okay?
- Fine.
Hello.
Excuse me.
You wanna hear my new song?
Okay, rock on.
Yes!
Mommy' s gonna listen to the rest of this song... when your mom and I are finished with work.
- Here you go.
- It was great, Phoebe.
Helen, I gotta tell you, I think we' re set here.
No, just one more, Max.
I was thinking about this one.
- I mean, I don' t know.
Lau.
- Yeah?
- Please!
It needs a little swag.
A scooch of Gucci.
Like this, but in gold.
No one will ever doubt you' re my son.
- Mom!
- What?
- He' s painting our roses again.
- It' s art.
You can' t call it art unless you have talent.
That' s just tagging.
Helen, really, I have got to go.
I think we' re really good.
I really should be getting out of here.
Max, just give me one second.
I love this one.
Just need one second, okay?
Mom, there' s something wrong with my sax.
What is it, honey?
- Okay, I' il be right back. - sounds the same to me.
What' s on my head?
What' s on my head?
What' s on my head?
- Jimi, we found Rainbow!
- Don' t let it bite me.
- Don' t let it bite me.
- Where' s Rainbow?
- Get it off!
- Here he is.
Come here, Rainbow.
- Come here, Rainbow.
- Over there.
Hey, Max, thank you for being so incredibly patient.
Get back here!
- This is fun.
- Fiona, come back.
Mom!
Aldo, are you okay?
I' m shiny, Mommy.
Yes, you are very shiny.
Max.
Max, I am so sorry.
It gets a little crazy around here sometimes.
A little?
No, Helen, this is all terrific.
You' re very talented, and so are your 10 kids.
Thank you, Max.
Maybe our next meeting will be a contract signing... and maybe it' il be in the city.
Yeah. sounds good.
- Hey, Max.
- Oh, I' m sorry.
- Okay.
Okay, can you please explain to me... why you just let that very single guy out of here without even asking for a date?
Phoebe, what guy could possibly deal with all of this?
Is this all yours, Admiral?
No, it belongs to the Coast Guard.
I' m just gonna run it for them. - so it is all yours.
- Basically.
Frank!
Frank.
- Good to see you, man.
- Good to see you, too, Darrell.
All right.
"Mad Dog" Beardsley.
Who' d have thought they' d ever let Frank "The Mad Dog" back here... much less run the place?
- You remember my youngest, Ethan?
- Mad Dog Jr.
Can you give me a....
Captain.
You are out of control, little man.
- Request permission to play, Admiral?
- Permission granted.
I' ve seen Navy sEALs not as well- trained.
Well, when there' s eight of them and one of you, it' s your only hope.
It' s Mad Dog Beardsley, the pirate.
Always on red alert with him.
Hey, Frank, are you dating at all yet?
No, no.
Not yet.
'Cause I know this terrific gal I' d love to set you up with.
I know you' d like her. she' s too good for me.
No, Darrell.
No, thanks.
All right.
Well, just think about it, that' s all I' m saying.
- I' il think about it.
- All right.
... winds out of the southeast at 5 miles an hour.
The barometer right now is 30. 27 and falling, air humidity 76%.
Now, there' s a 20% chance of showers for New London and points south.
Way to go, Paula!
Way to go, Paula!
You go!
- Why is Mommy crying?
- I think it' s hormones.
- Mom!
- Here.
- Mom, do you have my algebra -- - I got it covered.
- ln the chicks.
- Can you hand me that?
- Thank you for saving this.
All right, ladies, wanna go get dressed?
- Yeah.
- Come on, let' s go upstairs.
Come on.
- I' m out.
- Bye. see you later, alligator.
Bye, Mommy.
Reunion cruise.
Oh, yeah, like I have time to go on a cruise.
Mom!
Mick' s dog just puked on Aldo. sorry.
- I' m worried.
- Don' t be, Eth.
I' ve done this a million times.
You' il be great.
Okay, guys, fan out.
William and I will take Ethan to pre- K.
All right.
Everyone meet up here afterwards, okay?
Come on, it' il be fine.
- I' m gonna get you! - superheroes, hurray! - superhero bouncers.
I thought you weren' t interested in Max.
And I thought you weren' t gonna wear black anymore.
This isn' t black.
This is tie- dye.
And I' m not interested in Max.
I' m interested in that buyer that he' s bringing up from New York.
Oh, there it is.
Thanks, Phoebe.
Why don' t you just have them here?
Homes are for free expression, not for good impressions.
Incoming!
If you catch my drift.
Are you sure you wanna wear the uniform, Admiral?
Not that you don' t look great.
It just looks so military. she might as well know what she' s getting.
Okay, but hold off on that eight- kid thing.
Why?
Because that' s a minimum third- date, second- bottle- of- wine announcement.
Hey, you know, believe it or not, I have been on a few dates before... a couple of decades ago.
- Admiral?
- Yeah.
Ethan, do you know that you can call me Dad?
Oh.
Admiral, is this lady gonna be our new mom?
- I don' t think so.
It' s just a blind date. - she can' t see?
Can she navigate using sonar, like a bat?
Hey, why don' t you guys go swimming in the bathtub?
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Go ahead.
- I get the boat.
- Uh- uh, you get the duck.
- You get the duck.
- No.
Let' s just give her a little hint of what' s underneath.
You know, Christina, sometimes I wonder where you came from.
Mom' s side.
- Don' t wait up.
- I won' t.
And so Otter, he says, "ls she blind?"
And Ely wants to know if you' re a bat.
Because....
Would you like red or white?
- Red.
- Red it is.
Darrell would drink beer with everything.
I mean, if he could have a keg with dinner, he would.
- Would you like to order?
Waiter? - sure.
- I' il be right back. - sure.
see?
Now that is the kind of thing that would drive Darrell crazy.
"You' re here now," he' d say, "so take our order!"
You talk about Darrell a lot.
Well, yeah.
We were married for seven years.
He didn' t tell you that?
Must have slipped his mind.
Yeah, well, that' s just like him.
I' m gonna go hit the head.
Thank you so much.
- Helen?
- Frank.
- Helen?
- Frank.
- Helen?
- Frank Beardsley.
- Well, what are you -- - What are you --
- No, you first.
- No, you go first.
- Well, I' m having dinner with my....
- Hi, Frank.
Max Algrant.
Pleased to meet you. so, what are you doing back here? - sit down, sit down.
- Oh, yeah.
Thank you.
Well, I' ve been back here forever.
I didn' t want my kids growing up in the whole... you know, New York money- status thing.
- Yeah, that thing.
That' s right.
- Yeah. - so, are you in town for the reunion?
- No.
I' m....
I moved my family back here.
I' m running the Coast Guard Academy.
- I' m an Admiral.
- Yeah.
- That' s why I' m wearing the uniform.
- Yeah.
With a family.
- Well, you, too.
It' s great.
I mean....
- Yeah.
- We' re ready.
- Okay.
Well....
- It' s great to see you again.
- Good to see you.
Okay, bye.
Were you distracted by his good- conduct medal? shut up, Max.
Helen White.
"16, 137 results."
This lnternet is so darn easy.
Oh, God.
He' s married.
so how' d it go with Claudia? she' s quite a catch, huh?
Yeah.
It' s amazing you ever let her go. she mentioned she' s my ex- wife, did she?
Yeah, it came up.
What, did you ask for references?
You know, just 'cause she hates me is no reason you two couldn' t work out.
You know who I ran into at the restaurant?
- Uh- uh.
- Helen White.
Ding- ding?
Helen White?
Wait a minute.
The Helen White?
The one you were gonna marry?
Well, it' s either fate or trouble. she looked great, but I think she' s married. she was with some guy, and she had a ring.
Okay, that' s trouble.
Come on, Frank, what are you thinking?
I don' t know.
I was up all night.
I was Googling her.
Jeez, Frank, you Googled another man' s wife?
Yeah.
What do you think that means?
I don' t know. something dirty.
Well, it' s not.
I just wish there was a place I could run into her again.
Remember the senior- class picnic down by the river?
- The thunderstorm?
- Yeah.
Everybody screaming.
Then we crawled under the rowboat.
Oh, yeah.
And then, even when it stopped raining, we didn' t come out.
Yeah.
Anyway, that Max... he' s a lucky guy.
Max?
You think I' m with Max?
No.
But you' re wearing a wedding ring.
Yeah, no, I am.
I just never took it off.
My husband passed away about four years ago.
Car accident.
Oh, I' m sorry.
I understand.
I....
I lost my wife a few years ago.
Oh, Frank, I' m sorry.
Flashback!
Frank and Helen holding hands.
- so cute.
- You wanna dance?
so, how many kids do you have?
How many kids do you have?
You first.
Okay, look, you' re gonna find out eventually... because there' s too many to hide in the closet.
I have eight kids.
I have 1 0.
- You have 10?
- I have 10.
- You don' t.
- I do.
I have 10.
- Did you say 10?
- Yeah.
I had four and we adopted six.
I mean, that wasn' t the plan.
We were foster parents, and we just fell in love with all of them... so we adopted.
- Probably seems crazy.
- You don' t have to explain to me.
I mean, I never thought that I' d love being a dad this much.
My wife, she was the one who wanted the big family.
But now it just seems like the most natural thing in the world.
Is this really happening?
I hope so.
so then I asked her to marry me.
- And I said yes.
- What?
It was spontaneous and so romantic.
- How could you do this?
- We don' t even know this guy!
You got married?
- Yeah.
Yeah. sir, at least when you were reassigned to Guam, there was an e- mail.
Does he know you have 10 kids?
- Who wants the talking stick first?
- May I have it, please?
Yes, Jimi.
- Are you crazy?
- Yeah, Mom.
We don' t even know him, Mom!
Okay.
Quiet.
I have the talking stick.
He' s a lovely, lovely man.
And I' m sorry that we didn' t include you.
And he has....
Ten kids?
Hey, guys.
No.
There' s no way.
Let' s make this --
Guys!
It' il be fun... having 10 new brothers and sisters.
Okay, come on, guys.
Come on.
- Come on.
- Okay.
It' s gonna be fun.
But where will we live?
Hey, Mick, come down here.
Come on, Fiona.
Okay.
Head count.
We' ve got... 5, 10... 15, 16, 1 7, 18... plus the pig.
All present and accounted for.
Before you make your break for the bedroom... could you point me to my billet?
Behind the kitchen, Mrs. Munion.
How do you like the place?
- It has a certain...
- Charm.... smell.
Like paprika with a hint of wet dog.
We' re really glad you like the place.
Okay.
Okay.
- Crew!
- Kids!
All right, then.
All right, kids.
Fall in for billeting!
- For what?
- Room assignments.
All eyes on the chart.
Your rooms are numbered.
Your bathroom schedules are color- coded.
- You' ve gotta be kidding.
- Yeah, right.
That' s a good thing.
It' s great... because we all need a little bit of organization.
We do, honey.
You did a beautiful job.
Great.
Mom gets married, we get drafted.
Get back, Fiona.
Get back here.
Fiona.
Hey, what' s that badge for?
It' s pretty cool.
- Animal skinning.
- Mom!
- Done!
- You have an illness.
- Hey!
What are you doing?
- It' s called decorating.
- No, that' s called vandalism.
- Whatever.
Okay.
- No way.
- No way.
Come back, Fiona!
Come back! spit it. spit it out!
- Come on, spit it out.
- What is going on?
Come on, give it to me.
Where' s my cell phone?
You are so dead. she' s just a pig.
Not the pig.
You.
Mom, the cheerleader' s after me!
Run, Fiona!
Kids!
Admiral! sounds like they' re bonding.
That doesn' t sound like bonding to me, Frank.
- They just need a little jump- start.
- Jump- start?
Look, grab about a quart of sun block.
I have a plan.
Okay.
so, everyone, what do you think of the My Way?
Who' s gonna sail this thing?
We, the Beardsley family, sail it... while you guys, I' m guessing, hang out in the cabin and pick your noses.
No, we are all going to sail it... working together like the many tentacles of an octopus... guided by one brain.
My children have separate brains, Frank.
It' s just a figure of speech.
- No, it isn' t.
- Hey, trust me.
One hour at sea together, gonna be best friends.
Okay, prepare to come about!
- Coming about!
- Come a what?
Look out!
Wasn' t anybody listening... when I gave my briefing about standard nautical procedure?
I have sunscreen in my eye, sweetie.
Oh, well, let' s go below.
We' il wash it out.
- William, take the wheel.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Mrs. Munion, you have the kids.
- No problem.
Get that camera away from me.
But I' m capturing the verite of life at sea.
How about capturing my fist in your face?
Hey!
Look, Otter peed in his pants.
No, I didn' t.
That' s just water.
It doesn' t smell like water.
I' m gonna go tell our dad.
- I' m gonna tell my mom.
- I' m gonna tell my mom.
I don' t feel so good.
Just keep your eye on the horizon.
I' il get you some ginger ale.
- Kelly, get ready to feed the sail.
- Aye, aye.
What are you doing?
Come on, watch it.
Raise the jib!
Hey!
Get me down!
Get me down!
Okay, get me down from here, you freaks!
- such a loser.
- Oh, yeah?
Let' s see how funny you think this is from the water.
- He' s gonna kill me. - stop it!
You better run for it.
Oh, gross!
- What' s going on?
- Coming about!
William!
Come about!
- William!
- What' s going on?
I' m fine, sweetie.
Is this standard nautical procedure?
No.
Oops, missed a little spot right there.
What' s the matter?
I' m just giving up on my dream of having an all- family sailing team.
Well, look on the bright side.
You got to spend the day at sea with me.
Yeah.
Yeah, that was okay.
That was okay?
That was okay?
- I' il show you okay.
- Oh, yeah?
We can hear that.
No, you can' t.
Maybe if we' re really, really quiet.
Okay?
A little quieter.
No, I like hearing their voices.
It helps me sleep.
Well, I like quiet.
Now shut up.
- Why don' t you shut up, loser? - "shut up" is a bad word.
Maybe if we' re really, really, really....
Quiet.
Yeah.
This family is nuts.
Maybe if we had a door that worked.
Yeah.
Tomorrow.
Mom!
Make her stop!
That noise!
Hey, reveille!
Reveille!
It' s 6:. 05!
Time to get up!
Let' s go, let' s go, let' s go!
Move it, move it, move it!
Oh, my God.
Who' s killing a goat?
All right.
These are your schedules with latrine times.
You get seven minutes each.
Do not waste it.
Why do I suddenly feel like I' m in prison?
Fashion police caught up with you? snap!
Up top, girlfriend!
- Why the drill, Admiral?
- It' s not a drill, William.
We have doubled our force.
That calls for increased coordination.
Don' t worry, you' il soon be doing this in your sleep.
I am asleep.
- Can someone pass the hash browns?
- Hey, guys, give me that cereal.
Kelly, can you please give me a pancake?
I don' t want any.
Bacon, please.
Thank you.
Wait, I want that.
- Butter.
- Come on.
Give me the syrup, please.
Does somebody want to eat my oatmeal?
I' m sorry, William.
Is that your homework?
Listen up!
Before you go to school, there' s one thing we need to do.
- Everybody ready?
- Yeah.
- Hi, you' ve reached Frank.
- Helen.
- Harry.
- Bina.
- Naoko.
- Michael.
- Aldo.
- Joni.
- Phoebe.
- William.
- Otter.
- Ely.
- Christina.
- Ethan.
- Mick.
- Oh!
Hey, are you the freaks?
I heard you have, like, 25 brothers and sisters.
No, we just have 16.
- Nasty.
- Dude, I hear they all sleep in drawers!
And they' re so poor, they all have to share one pair of underpants!
Eighteen kids!
Man, that' s like The Brady Bunch!
Wait!
Party of Five times three, plus My Three Sons.
What?
I like math.
Yeah.
Won' t we, like....
Oh, my....
- Hey.
- Hi.
And all the pieces fit
And everything was bright
Unbelievable.
Not only do I have to listen to it at home... but I' m forced to catch the road show.
Well, not all music needs back- up dancers.
Just the good music.
- Hey.
- Hey!
Forget about it.
What are you talking about?
Look, I' ve known Nick for years.
He' s cute, but totally shallow.
Then again, maybe he is your type.
Where' s the Admiral?
I' m lodging a formal complaint against Phoebe. she stinks!
He' s probably out dreaming up new ways to ruin our lives.
This is so ridiculous!
Just because he got married, we all have to suffer.
Not necessarily.
Okay, what are you doing on Dad' s computer?
Just making a few changes to the schedule.
Unauthorized, of course.
Now this I can live with.
Come on!
I have to get ready for school.
Your face isn' t big enough to hold that much makeup.
Get a watch, hippie chick.
It' s my time. she' s right.
Our time was first.
No way.
I checked the schedule last night.
Those evil preppies must have changed it.
- We should pound them!
- Yeah.
Kick their butts.
To me, nothing says "time to get out of the bathroom" like....
Fire!
Hey, what' s going on?
Watch your backs.
- Where' s the fire?
- Be quick.
Go downstairs!
Outside, outside.
On the grass.
On the grass.
Everyone, let' s go!
Okay, out the door, out the door.
Get out, get out, get out!
- Yeah.
Guys, guys!
Come on, let' s go watch them!
- Nice towel, Christina.
- Yeah, cute boxers, William.
- You guys are so dead.
- At least we' il be clean.
Can I get the two of you guys closer together?
- Naoko, what are you doing?
- Webcasting.
say cheese.
Come on, guys.
This is our talking stick.
And this is a "no judgment circle." so whoever has the stick... may express themselves without fear or interruption. so, William, why don' t you begin?
Go ahead.
Just, you know, say what you need to.
Wait.
One of you must have something to say.
Okay, if I can interrupt...
I' il take the talking stick.
Okay, I have something to say.
In the interest of making this house a home...
I have come up with a little chore chart.
- You gotta be kidding me.
- ls this a joke?
Charts are never a joke with the Admiral.
Look, Mom, we gotta go.
We' re gonna be late.
- Let' s go.
- Yeah, let' s get out of here.
Whoa!
I want you all home right after school... because we have to go out and requisition supplies.
- Dismissed.
- Let' s go.
That' s a nice chart, Frank.
Looks like you put a lot of work into it.
And this is definitely one of a kind.
Give me that.
That was a disaster.
Well, at least there' s no blood.
Yet.
- What are you doing?
- Hey, Christina.
You lied to me.
You said he was a loser.
- He is a loser.
- Hey!
- A very hot loser.
- Cool.
Thanks for the warning, sis.
I' il be sure to return the favor, first chance I get.
she seems sweet.
Hey, Admiral, will you build me and Aldo a sandbox?
Well, sure, once we get further along with the house.
Yay, a sandbox!
Okay, blue team, spackle.
Red team, insulation.
- You guys, stop that!
- I didn' t hit you.
- Hey.
- Give it back.
You want the ball?
Go get it.
- Where' d it go?
- Let' s go get it!
Hey, buddy, would you give me a hand?
- It' s mine.
- No, it' s mine.
- It' s mine.
- Mine.
- Mine.
- I want it!
It' s my ball!
Give it back.
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, Dad.
- How do you stop this thing?
- Otter?
I don' t know!
Otter!
- Turn the wheel!
- Ely!
Hey!
Whoa, stop! stop!
Hey, hit the brake!
Hit the brake!
What, this one?
Where is the brake?
I don' t know.
Pull that lever!
I can' t reach it!
Pull it!
- The other lever!
- It' s this one!
The other one.
The other lever!
It' s the other lever.
- No, it' s this one.
- Oh, no!
Otter!
Pull the lever!
Pull the lever!
The other one!
The other lever!
Pull the....
- What will we do?
- Get off it!
Otter, Ely!
- Admiral, you okay?
- Where are the boys?
- Where are the boys?
- What?
- Where are the boys?
- I don' t know.
Otter!
stop! stop!
Yay, a sandbox!
- How' s it going?
- Good.
I ordered us a part that' il have us up and running in no time.
You sure are putting a lot of effort into fixing that big old light bulb.
A lighthouse without a light is just a house.
And that' s a problem because....
Have I ever told you the story of the beautiful lighthouse keeper?
No.
I think I would have remembered that.
Well, once upon a time, there was a beautiful lighthouse keeper.
Wait, wait.
I thought that lighthouse keepers... were old men in yellow raincoats with long white beards.
Oh, no.
This one was a real hottie. - she had long red hair. she was tall...
- Yeah.... and her body, it was the bomb.
Anyway, her man was a sailor.
Oh, I love sailors.
And he was afraid that she' d find someone else whenever he was away.
- No. - so she said to him...
"my heart will always be yours."
so, from then on, whenever he was away at sea... he could just look back and he' d see that light... and he knew that his true love still cared.
- Frank?
- Yes, my beautiful lighthouse keeper.
We' re doing the right thing, aren' t we?
- We' ve had a bumpy start.
- Yeah.
Come here, I wanna show you something.
- Okay.
- Look.
Okay.
see that?
That' s the buddy system.
We' re jelling as a family, even as we speak.
Yeah.
You know, it just might work.
- You have to turn it over.
- I know, Lau.
- Thicker, Kelly, thicker.
- I know.
Otter and Ely, playing outside.
Ethan, Aldo, playing inside.
Marisa and Bina....
- Can we plant flowers?
- A garden?
I think planting a garden would be lovely.
- Yay, a garden!
- Flowers are going to be fun. so that leaves time for a little drive.
I have this romantic spot I' ve been wanting to take you to.
I' il get my keys.
Mrs. Munion, would you mind watching the little kids for a while?
Oh, sure.
They' il be in full lockdown.
- Good.
- Well, lockdown won' t be necessary.
Just check in on them every now and then.
We' il be back.
Mrs. Munion' s in charge.
Finally, a moment alone.
Excuse me.
sorry.
We' re with quality control.
- Products testing.
- I' m sorry.
Oh, my God!
- Just leave it.
Come on.
- I' m so sorry.
- I' m really, really sorry.
- Let' s try that one.
- Oh, my gosh.
- Better yet, let' s go look at sofas.
Why do I have to do all this work just to live with these jerks?
Well, what do you suggest?
What, are you gonna drop a stink bomb on them?
Just watch the master.
- Hey!
- Watch it, jerk.
Loser!
- Goofer.
- Hey, get back here.
- You did not just splatter me with paint.
- What are you talking about?
- You did not just splatter me with paint.
- What are you talking about?
Is that my shirt?
The one that you just got paint on?
Yeah, thank God.
- Take it off.
- Hey!
- How dare you?
- Don' t...
- stop it. -... wear my clothes.
- Hey, it' s not a construction pit.
- You' re not the boss of us.
Oh, yeah?
- Get them!
Get them!
- Take this.
- Hey, that' s my Rescue Hero.
- I want it.
- Give it back.
- Ow!
Loser!
Hit him with the chair!
What' s that noise?
Losers!
My wallpaper!
- Hey, what' s going on?
- Now you guys are all in trouble.
You' re going down, Jimi!
stop! stop!
Hey, guys!
stop!
Hey!
Hey, stop!
Guys!
Whoa! stop!
You wrecked the house, you trashed the yard... and you painted the pig.
You turned a 200- year- old panel foyer into a Jackson....
- Pollock.
- Pollock!
- It was her fault for wearing my shirt -- - I am not finished!
Now, your mother and I know that you do not get along.
But you' re just going to have to pretend... that you like each other until you actually do.
And until you have learned why we think that you are all....
Till you....
Until you' ve learned why we think you' re all so terrific... we demand a level of civility and cooperation... or I will bring the hammer down.
- No, no.
That' s just a metaphor.
- I' m scared.
- Don' t be scared, Aldo.
Don' t be scared.
- I am. - should I go get the hammer, sir?
It' s not a real hammer.
It' s just a pretend hammer.
I only said that for effect.
Now, we' d like you to all think about what we just said.
Except for maybe the part about the hammer.
Yeah, forget the hammer.
Let' s just....
Let' s just get started cleaning this place up.
But first, let' s have a group hug.
- Come on.
- Okay.
- Good, good.
- You mean...
- Yeah, that' s what I mean.
Come on.
Frank.
Yeah.
Well....
Gang, let' s get in on this group- hug thing.
Come on, let' s....
Come on.
There you go.
Can' t you feel the love, honey?
Okay, everybody.
It' s time that we call a truce.
- No way.
- Over my dead body.
We need to unite against a greater enemy.
And that enemy' s name is Mom and Dad.
What are you talking about?
He' s saying we are all totally incompatible... but our parents don' t seem to care.
Exactly.
Guys, we' re all in this together. some of us are in it together... and some of us are busy cornering the boyfriend market.
You stole my shirt.
Now we' re even, cheerleader.
Come on, guys, none of us likes this situation.
But if we want out, then we gotta stop fighting and get them to start.
- Really?
- How are we gonna do that?
Easy.
Who knows what drives our parents crazy better than we do?
Helen!
- Hey, I wanna do it!
- I wanna do it!
Oh, no, no.
Guys, where are the baby greens?
It looks like Frank did some shopping.
What is that smell?
My God.
- That' s barbaric.
- ls that a liver?
Well, shall we get some tea?
That would be lovely.
I love tea in the afternoon.
I love tea, but we have to boil it.
Helen!
Atten- hut!
Right shoulder arms!
Right face!
Forward arms!
- Ready!
- Looking good, men.
- Don' t they?
- Ready!
- Fire!
Ready!
Fire!
- Frank.
- Frank!
- What if he brings his hammer?
- There is no hammer.
But maybe we' re kind of crossing the line.
And I don' t feel right about endangering the little kids.
Trust me, they' re biologically protected by the cuteness factor.
This is gonna be good.
You like it? - stop!
- lsn' t it pretty?
That was very naughty.
What' s happening?
Boys, I don' t think that was a good idea, do you?
- No.
- No.
But that was very important to your father... so you need to say you' re sorry. - sorry. - sorry.
Okay, now go on and play.
Whoa, whoa!
"Go play"?
Well, they' re four years old, Frank.
What else is there?
The hammer?
- There are other -- - A spanking?
No, honey, of course not.
We don' t spank our children.
The Admiral does.
Occasionally, a little pat on the butt sends a clear message.
- Well, you' re not spanking my children.
- I thought they were our children.
You' re not spanking our children.
Okay, fine.
Let' s just let them all run naked and wild.
- Yay!
- Yay!
Do you think it' s working?
- Does that answer your question?
- Yes!
The committee was very impressed, Frank.
Nice job.
I take my work very seriously, sir.
And don' t think that the brass hasn' t noticed.
- The brass, sir?
- I' m the brass, and I' ve noticed.
I just don' t like giving direct compliments. something about it feels unmanly.
- Well, thank you.
- Oh, what the hell.
Goldarn, I' m proud of you, Frank.
You deserve everything you' re about to get.
- Helen?
- Yeah.
We got saks.
What?
- We got saks.
- Oh, Max!
I got saks!
I got saks.
Thank you!
I can' t believe it, Max!
Yeah, but don' t get too excited.
They wanna see a dozen new designs by Friday.
By Friday?
Oh, I' m excited and scared, all at the same time.
No, you can do it.
At least now you got Frank to lean on.
Yeah, yeah.
I guess.
Well, I better get going.
I got a lot to do.
Do you like these better?
- Okay.
Well, then I think you' re set.
- Thank you.
Love you.
- sorry about the chalkboard, Admiral.
- It' s all right, sailor.
Hey.
Why don' t you just kiss her and make up?
Mrs. Munion isn' t so bad.
You' re not getting any younger.
- Can we please have some privacy?
- All right.
I' m off.
- I' m sorry about what happened.
- Me, too.
so, how' d your meeting go?
Did he mention anything about the promotion?
No, not really.
It' s....
That' s just a pipe dream, anyway.
- ls it?
- You' re not getting rid of me that easily.
- How was your day?
- Oh, my day.
Well, let' s see.
I ate and I worked a little bit... and I made a giant deal with saks Fifth Avenue.
- You did not!
- I did, too.
That' s great news.
Oh, that' s fantastic.
- I' m so proud of you.
- I couldn' t wait to tell you.
Great.
Well, how could I help you?
- What can I do around here to help you?
- You need help organizing the studio?
- No, no.
The studio is organized.
Of course it is, yeah.
Well, I' il think of something.
Guys, guys!
Listen up!
Your mom is going to be very busy over the next couple of days... so I want everyone on their best behavior.
- That' s an order.
- We' re always on our best behavior, sir.
- Ethan!
- Get away...
- from Mrs. Munion.
Excuse us!
Boys!
I guess we' il be doing a little extra cleaning, too.
- Ethan, this way.
- Come back.
As you were.
This way!
Cleaning, huh?
Grab the other guys.
I know just where to start.
Bright colors.
Permanent press.
Whites.
Excuse me.
- It' s still wet. - socks.
Michael, is there something you forgot? shut up.
That' s mine.
Oh, my gosh.
That was so sick.
- Did you do it?
- Yeah.
Kids!
I just don' t understand.
Where are my velvet, blue buttons?
You know what?
Why would anybody do this?
- But it' s clean.
- No, honey, I can' t work with clean.
I have a deadline.
Oh, my God, I' il never be able to find anything.
My Ultrasuede used to be here, right beneath the blue fur.
Do you remember that?
- Where' s my fake alligator skin?
- We thought we' d surprise you.
Yeah, we thought that you' d like it.
The Admiral always does say, "A clean ship is a happy ship."
Hey.
Wow!
This place is shipshape.
Well, you just had to, Frank, didn' t you?
- Excuse me?
- You know, Frank...
I understand your pathological need to organize the rest of the house... but this is my space.
I need just a little bit of respect.
You' re killing me, Frank.
Did I miss something?
Yes.
Don' t you think you' re overreacting just a little?
Me?
You know what?
Never mind, Frank.
You know, you were gonna spank the boys... over wrecking your silly organizational chart... but I' m not allowed to be upset about my studio.
I was not going to spank them.
And charts are not silly.
Do you know what happens to a ship in chaos?
It sinks.
Homes are for free expression, not for good impressions.
Well, I' m sorry, but in the military, there' s little room for free expression.
Except for that we' re not in the military, Frank.
You are.
I just thought that you would work better in a clean studio.
I knew it!
I knew you put them up to it.
I most certainly did not!
No, maybe not directly, but in that whole orderly, military... regimented brainwashing thing.
- You left out anal- retentive.
- Oh, and that, too.
Is that what you think?
Yes, that' s what I think.
Then I think that I' m sleeping somewhere else.
I' m gonna fix that.
Officer asleep.
Go, Kelly!
Go, Kelly!
Be, be aggressive!
Be aggressive!
Be, be aggressive!
Be aggressive!
Be, be aggressive!
Be aggressive!
Now put your hands up in the air and wave them like you just don' t care
And if you think that Kelly is the best let me hear you say, "Oh, yeah!"
Oh, yeah!
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah!
Go, Kelly.
Go, Kelly The other team is
Smelly
- They' re quaking like they' re - Jelly!
- We got sisters from - New Delhi!
- Go, Kelly!
- Go, Kelly!
The other team is smelly!
They' re quaking like they' re jelly!
We got sisters from New Delhi!
Go, Kelly!
Okay, phase two.
I think that we just need one more big thing to push them over the edge.
Have them catch you and Phoebe together?
You' re really sick.
Okay, then have them catch you and Phoebe together.
How about they catch me with my hands around your neck?
Listen, the Commandant' s coming this weekend.
They have to go to the trustees' dinner, and Mrs. Munion has the weekend off.
Two words, "par" and "ty."
- Party.
- Yeah, I got that.
No, it' s a perfect idea, because Mom won' t care and Frank' s gonna hate it.
You guys ready?
Let' s get to work.
Oh, no, I can' t!
I still have to make, like, a million of these posters for the election!
Yeah, for what, the class of '59?
You couldn' t get elected hall monitor with this.
Here.
Imagine this in a three- color spray paint.
Nice.
And I know some great campaign workers.
William Beardsley for president, okay?
Vote for William Beardsley!
Vote William Beardsley!
Hey, Brad.
Vote William Beardsley.
Great guy.
Okay.
What?
Thank you.
Thank you.
William Beardsley for president.
Vote for Beardsley.
Vote for Will!
Vote for Will!
- Here you go!
- Thanks.
This could actually help get me elected.
Yeah. somebody might actually think you' re cool... if they didn' t know you.
That' s funny.
We' il be home after midnight.
Make sure the kids don' t stay up too late.
Have fun at the trustee dinner.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
One minute.
Are you timing me?
- No.
- No.
Okay.
- Hey, Mom.
- Yeah, honey.
William and I were wondering if we could have a couple friends over.
You know, after we put the little kids to sleep?
Unbelievable.
Can we, Mom?
You have a good time.
Okay, honey?
- Thanks.
You, too.
- All right, sweetheart. she went for it. so, where are the little kids?
I got them covered.
Root beer chug!
Ladies and gentlemen... first of all, I wanna thank Admiral Beardsley and his wife Helen... for this wonderful evening.
Frank, you run a tight ship.
You ought to see me on the water.
That' s why, tonight, I' m gonna offer my recommendation... that Admiral Frank Beardsley... be my successor as Commandant.
You know, Frank, being Commandant, you' il be at sea... wishing that you were home.
Or you' il be in Washington, wishing that you were at sea!
Let' s all stand and applaud...
Commandant Frank Beardsley.
Thank you, Commandant sherman.
I know that... this command is an incredible opportunity... and a great honor.
But I' ve just started here at the Academy... and it would not be fair to my cadets... nor would it be fair to my new family... who just about outnumber the cadets.
And so, sir...
I must respectfully decline.
And I hope that you know how honored I am.
Think you might reconsider?
You wanna sleep on it?
No, sir, I' m sure.
Thank you.
I' il do it.
Get a load of this guy.
You wanna sleep on it.
I understand.
- What' s going on, baby?
- What are you doing?
Oh, don' t worry.
Look, I' m making the money... but I' m gonna split it with everybody, minus a 1 0% service fee.
What is this?
I didn' t order any beer.
Don' t look at me.
I just wanted to break our parents up, not go to jail!
- I didn' t order pizza.
- Well, somebody did.
And somebody owes me $379, plus tip. - $379?
- Plus tip.
I' il be right back.
Gross.
Yo, Christina.
Cool party.
Hey, Nick.
Phoebe' s out trying to raise money for pizza.
- Maybe I came to see you.
- Me?
Wow.
I can' t believe you' re really into me.
You' re hot.
Why wouldn' t I be?
I don' t know.
Maybe because...
Phoebe is my sister.
- Hey, Phoebe.
- Get lost, loser.
- Look, I' m really sorry.
- No, no, I' m so sorry.
Let' s promise never to let boys come between us again.
Yeah, like that' s really gonna happen.
Come on.
Oh, no.
Yo, what' s up, dude?
Let' s just take a deep breath, Frank.
Yo, B, nice hat.
Ahoy, matey.
Oh, boy.
- Jimi, I' ve been looking all over for -- - There you go.
Phoebe!
- Hi.
- What is going on here?
Mom said that we could have some people over.
- You agreed to this?
- No.
Phoebe, I said you could have a few friends over.
I did not agree to this.
Where' s everybody else?
Where are the little kids?
Need more chocolate.
Would everyone who lives here please raise your hand?
Anyone else remaining here after five minutes... will be forcibly conscripted into the United states Coast Guard.
sir, there is the matter of $379, plus --
Kitchen!
All right, everybody fall in!
I said, "Fall in!"
Dylan, Phoebe, I am very disappointed in both of you.
Disappointed?
Is that what you are, Helen?
Disappointed?
- William, Christina, front and center.
- Frank, take it easy.
No, Helen.
There has been enough taking it easy around here.
That clearly doesn' t work.
I should have never gone against my better judgment.
This is why we have rules.
Do you hear yourself?
Because it' s not all about rules.
You sound like some military robot, Frank!
Yeah?
Well, you sound like a big Free To Be You and Me flake.
You have one hour to get this place cleaned up.
There is nothing wrong with having rules.
Everybody lives by them.
The entire universe lives by them.
Well, then, Frank, that' s the last thing these kids need from me.
There' s only one rule I know, and that' s...
"At any time, all of this could be over, taken away from you forever."
And then who needs more rules after that?
I can' t live like this anymore, Frank, and neither can my kids.
I don' t know how yours do it.
My kids got along just fine until we moved in together.
- Everything was shipshape.
- Oh, Frank.
It' s obvious that we got into this way too fast.
I thought we could just pick up where we left off in high school.
But maybe that' s a lot longer ago than we both realized.
Maybe it was.
Hey, you know what, Frank?
I think you should take that job.
- I told you, I don' t want to take the -- - No, just come on!
We both know what your better judgment is telling you, okay?
You know what?
Just please go.
Just go.
Does this mean you' re not going to be my brother anymore?
I don' t know.
Let' s get this party started.
Who wants a double- stuffed?
Helen cried herself to sleep tonight.
We should be ashamed.
It' s all our fault.
Yeah.
My mom was happier with your dorky dad than I' ve seen her in years.
And we totally screwed it up.
But this is what we wanted, remember?
Two separate families.
Yeah, but I didn' t know it would feel like this.
Yeah.
- Hello?
- Hi.
It' s me.
Hi.
I think maybe I will take that job.
Well... you know, Frank, we have to talk to the kids.
I' il tell them.
Okay.
Well, I' il see you.
Goodbye.
Hey, look who it is.
It' s the freaks.
Yeah, why don' t you go home to your shoe? - shut up!
- Did you just tell him to shut up?
Is there a problem, punk?
What' s it to you?
You mess with my brothers, you mess with me.
- sure.
- And me.
- And me.
- And me.
- And me.
- And me.
And me.
It' s all good.
Otter, are these the kids that have a problem with big families?
- They say we share our underpants.
- That' s just ignorance.
And do you know how to stop ignorance?
- Education?
- Close.
Butt- whupping.
- Let' s go!
- Come on!
Hey, what' s going on, guys?
Just some kids messing with our little brothers.
- But we handled it.
- Family style!
William!
You won the election!
Does this mean that you move to the White House?
- Way to go, Willie.
- Couldn' t have done it without you, Bro.
Dad, guess what happened today at school?
Hey, I wanna tell him.
Have you ever heard yourself tell a story?
You have a tendency of rambling.
Okay, listen up, guys!
I have something important to say.
- We' re leaving?
- What?
No.
Do we have to leave?
Look, just 'cause you and Mom had a little fight...
- that' s no reason -- - It was a big fight.
This whole thing is our fault.
We tried to make all of you live with people... that you have nothing in common with... and that was self- centered of us.
It was pigheaded.
And I' d like to talk about this more... but my ship sails in a half- hour.
Where are you going?
I have to visit all the commands on the East Coast... to prep for my new job.
so let' s lose the long faces.
Now, if you ever need anything, that means all of you North kids... you just call me.
I' il be there.
Got it?
Bye, Frank.
William, you know the routine.
Mrs. Munion will bring you down to Washington once I get us set up.
- But you can' t go.
- Come on, Dad.
- Please!
- Please.
Listen.
I promise everything will be exactly as it was before.
This is our last move.
I have to go.
You' re not gonna tell him you won Class President?
- Doesn' t matter anymore.
- What are you gonna do?
I' m gonna pack and we' re gonna move, just like every other time. so that' s it?
We' re just gonna give in and let this happen?
- You know the drill, Christina.
- William, wait!
Wait!
- What?
- Please...
I don' t wanna lose another mommy.
He' s right.
Well, then I guess we better stop that boat.
- Yay!
- Yay!
Kelly! some of you guys should stay here and wait for Mom.
- Got it.
- All right, as for the rest of us...
Iet' s do this. ship' s company!
I know how to cheer Mom up.
Let' s put her room back to the way she likes it.
- Yeah!
- Let' s do it!
Lau!
Help!
Mrs. Munion!
- Oh, my God!
- Mrs. Munion!
Help!
Hold on!
Hold on!
surprise!
Mrs. Munion, what is going on?
I was just vacuuming up a storm and --
Where is everybody?
Where are the big kids?
They all went to go stop Dad.
And we stayed here to mess the place up... because you were so mad when we cleaned it up.
We changed our minds about the plan to break you up.
We like living together.
You planned to break us up?
- Oh?
Come on, kids.
Come on.
- No, Mom.
- What?
We have to go.
- Remember the old you? spanking is never the answer.
No, honey, no spanking.
Come on, kids.
I know what we need to do.
- Commandant on the bridge.
- Welcome aboard, sir.
- Happy to be aboard.
- Thank you, sir.
Admiral, we' ve cleared the seaboard.
We' re ready to pick up full speed.
Ask Admiral Beardsley. soon it' s all gonna be his.
Frank, you give the orders.
Awaiting your command, Admiral.
- All stop!
- All stop, aye!
Now what?
It' s my kids.
- Drop the sail.
- Yes, sir, Captain. - secure those lines. - securing lines.
- Prepare to come alongside.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- What are you doing here? - stopping you!
Dad, we have a confession.
We were behind everything, all the fights.
We tried to break you and Mom up... so we could go back to the way things were.
We made a huge mistake.
And we realize that we should all be a family.
- Come on, Dad!
Come on home.
- We need to be together!
- Come on, Dad, let' s go home!
- We need you.
I' m sorry, guys.
It' s already too late.
Your mom is really....
My beautiful lighthouse keeper.
I' m sorry.
I am, too.
- This is where I belong.
- Yeah.
And I think my kids agree.
- Yeah!
- Your kids?
Our kids.
- Will you marry me again?
- Yeah.
Only this time, the right way.
- You know what we need?

- Yeah.
- You sure?
Sure I' m sure.
- You remember the first time you left home?
- Yes.
And I was just as scared as you are.
I' m not scared.
I just don' t like the idea of leaving you here all alone.
Oh, I' il be fine.
I was fine when you went away to computer camp.
Mom, that was just for two weeks.
I can take care of myself.
I' m much more worried about you.
I' m gonna be just fine.
I got Lewis.
Gilbert?
Come on, rise and shine.
Dad' s waiting outside in the car.
It' s all packed.
Hi, Flo.
It' s a beautiful day, isn' t it?
It' s gonna be a great year.
Now, I figure with lunch and two ARVs, we should be on the road approximately 7 hours, 18 minutes and 7 seconds.
- ARVs?
- Average restroom visits.
Oh, I' m so proud of you two boys.
Come on, Gilbert.
Let' s go to college.
Hey, Lewis, what time you got?
I' m tryin 'to work out our exact ETA.
I got two thirty- seven.
Dad, how fast are we going?
I' ve got the old cruise control set at 35.
Adams College, home of the Atoms.
Gilbert, this is gonna be really neat.
What if it isn' t, huh?
Don' t be so negative.
We' il have the time of our lives.
I' m not being negative.
I' m being nervous.
Don' t be, cos everything' s gonna be great.
- Just like high school, right?
- This is college.
Remember, there are 6, 127 students at Adams.
- 58 per cent of which are girls.
- So?
So that' s 7, 107. 32 boobs.
You college guys are all alike.
All you really care about is gettin 'laid.
- (braying laugh)
Dad!
(Lewis) Wow!
This campus is awesome.
It' s a lot bigger than I expected.
Maybe we should have just gone to City Tech, huh?
Tech' s nothin '.
You know Adams has got the best computer department in the country.
Yeah, you' re right.
Adams is the best.
I mean "men"... here we are.
What an opportunity for you guys.
You' re both gonna do great.
I' m proud of you.
Your father would have been proud of you, too, Gilbert.
I know, Mr Skolnick.
Don' t tell my mother I was nervous.
I wouldn' t want her to worry.
- Of course not.
Don' t sweat it.
- Thanks.
Hey, Lewis, come here.
Sit down.
I envy you, Lewis.
This is one of the finest institutions in the country.
You' re gonna do fantastic here.
Try not to break too many hearts.
That hasn' t been a real problem yet.
Come on, you' re gonna make some lucky girl very happy.
You' re smart, easy- going.
Got your father' s good looks.
And you got a great sense of humour.
I really believe in you, son.
- Thanks, Dad.
I won' t let you down.
- I know.
Gilbert, help me with the trunk.
- Uh, Gilbert?
- Yes, sir?
College isn' t like high school.
You' il be on your own.
I want you to take care of yourself.
I will.
I got Lewis.
Besides, we' re college men now, right?
- Ow.
It' s easier gettin 'it down.
Hold it, guys.
This is an historic moment.
All right, say "cheese".
(both) Cheese!
Got it.
Bye, Dad.
Bye.
Thanks for the ride.
- You OK?
- Yeah.
- (Gilbert) Bye, Mr Skolnick!
- (Lewis) Drive careful, Dad.
(girl) Watch out!
- Sorry.
- Excuse us.
You know, Gilbert, I feel different already.
Like... more mature.
Looks like we' re in for quite a change.
I' il say.
Parties, meeting new people.
This is really gonna be great.
- I don' t know.
- Just relax.
Be yourself.
Like Davy Crockett always said - be sure you' re right, then go ahead.
- Anyway, college is a whole new ball game.
- Nerds!
- People judge you different than in school.
- Nerds!
Nerds!
Nerds!
- Where are they?
- I think they' re talking about us.
- No way.
- Nerds!
- Nerds!
Nerds!
- (all chant) Nerds!
Nerds!
Come on, Lewis, let' s go.
Fill her up, baby!
OK, everybody, listen up!
It' s time for stair diving!
- Well, Gilbert, here' s our new home.
- Can' t believe we finally made it.
Lewis, if you don' t want the bed by the window, I' il take it.
- You got it.
- Thanks.
- You know, this is really a great room.
- Yep.
Definite possibilities.
Do you think they' d let us put in a little refrigerator for snacks?
Are you kiddin ', Gilbert?
We can put a fridge and a microwave right there.
That' d be a good place for an entertainment centre, too.
Great.
That' s just the beginning.
We' il have the best dorm room on campus.
I don' t know about the best.
It' il be the messiest.
Relax, Gilbert.
Remember, we got it covered.
This robot will be better than a maid.
It' il help with the women, too.
- Women?
- Yeah.
Let' s say one of us is up here with a woman.
This' il be our warning device, so we don' t walk in on each other.
Wait a minute.
We' re allowed to have girls in our dorm room?
Not girls, Gil.
Women.
We' re college men now.
- lsn' t college great?
- It' s gonna be a great year.
Gable, check this out.
Check this out.
This is outrageous.
- What is it?
- Just try it.
You OK?
- Jeez, Burke!
- 188 proof.
Watch.
Take that.
Flame on, buddy.
Flame on!
Can you do it again?
Do it again.
(they chant) Fireball.
Fireball.
One more!
One more!
One more!
Fireball.
(they chant) Fireball!
Fireball!
(all) Oh, shit!
- It must have been the wiring.
- That isn' t what the fire department thinks.
Dean, if my boys say it was the wiring, you gotta believe them.
Dean, school ought to be more careful.
We got a big game comin 'up.
I don' t want my boys worried about where they' re gonna live.
They should have thought of that before they burnt their house down.
What' s done is done.
Where am I gonna put my athletes?
- The freshman dorm?
- What about the students there now?
All right.
Right?
- (jocks) Right!
- These freshmen are sittin 'pretty in there!
- So as of now, that dorm is ours!
Right?
- Yeah!
Any room you want.
Ready?
Break!
Don' t come back!
There' s your roommate, pal!
If everyone follows directions, we can manage this move with as little inconvenience as possible.
All right, men.
I want everybody to listen up.
We' re movin 'out, and I mean now!
Move it!
Move, move, move!
(jock) Get outta here!
All right, listen up.
I' m gonna see to it that each and every one of you is taken care of.
You will be provided with the best possible food, shelter and accommodation.
- We will try to provide you...
- Now let' s move it out!
Move it!
Move, move, move!
Move it!
Move it!
Get outta here!
(all chant) Nerds!
Nerds!
Nerds!
(Dean) I know this move has been sudden for all of you, and you' re probably all still very disoriented.
I do want to assure you that this move is in no way permanent.
It' s only temporary.
As you see, we' ve provided accommodations for you that are... quite acceptable.
It' il be a nice place for you to enjoy your studies.
(boy) I don' t even wanna go to college.
You have a special gift.
You need college to develop it.
I wanna be with people my own age.
You will be with people your own age when you' re older.
But you can' t drop me off in a gymnasium.
It looks like we' re refugees from a war.
We gotta go now, honey.
Your dad has an appointment.
Bye, son.
(Dean) It is really very comfortable here.
Is there anyone here with allergies?
Me too.
Uh, for those of you who do have allergies, you can request a foam rubber pillow.
Also, there' s a television for your viewing pleasure.
It is a black and white television.
More good news.
Because of the housing situation, we are allowing the freshman class to join and live in fraternities.
The fraternities will select their members tomorrow.
All right!
Enough of this social bullshit.
Grab a cot.
(coach) Go, son.
(Dean on PA) And the Delta Kappa Gamma fraternity has selected as its new members
Oliver Scott and Bill Daniels.
(Dean) For those of you who weren' t selected by any fraternities, you won' t be left out in the cold.
You can stay here in the gym for as long as you like.
Or at least until basketball season.
Please answer when I call out your names.
Poindexter, Arnold.
Latrelle, Lamar.
(effeminately) Lamar Latrelle.
Wormser, Harold.
Present.
Takashi, Toshiro.
Ah, here, sir.
Dawson, Dudley.
Call me "Booger".
All right...
Booger.
Rakhim, Raj.
Ah, excuse, please, but why do they call you "Booger"?
I don' t know.
Posquito, Lawrence.
Daniels, Paul.
I knew nobody' d pick us, Lewis.
Gilbert, it' s probably not over yet.
There' s a fraternity for us.
(Dean) Dooley, Edward.
Yozonski, Yosef.
Are you sure about this?
- Gilbert, yes.
Come on.
(Lewis) Hi, girls.
Are you guys looking to join a sorority?
A sorority?
No!
We need some help.
We figured pretty girls like you might be able to suggest a fraternity.
Choosing the right fraternity can be one of the most important decisions in a man' s life.
- For sure.
- Guys like you have to choose very carefully.
- Definitely.
- Tell us what frat do you think is us.
- You guys are Alpha Betas all the way.
- Totally.
For sure.
What?
Wait.
Aren' t Alpha Betas, like, all jocks and face men?
Yes.
But you guys have got that certain something I know they' d be interested in.
- I' il tell 'em you' re coming.
- Should we ask for a particular Alpha Beta?
- Stan Gable.
- And you' re...?
Betty Childs.
Thank you, Betty.
Ms Childs.
Maybe if you' re not busy sometime we could have a cup of coffee or somethin '.
Come on, pal.
(Gilbert) I can' t believe you asked her out.
(Lewis) You know, Gilbert, if we get in, maybe we can have our old room back.
- (Gilbert) These guys will never accept us.
- Why wouldn' t they?
These are the Alpha Betas.
They' re the football players.
I don' t think Ms Childs would have sent us over here if she didn' t think we had a decent chance of getting in.
- (eerily) Yes?
Tell Stan Gable that we' re the guys that Betty Childs sent over.
Follow me, boys.
(solemnly) Welcome.
(both) Hi.
(Stan) Hey!
You guys seem pretty cool.
Take these for later.
Rubbers?
What do we need rubbers for?
(Stan) Let the initiation begin.
(jock) Have you ever made love to a woman?
- Yes.
- No.
- No.
- Yes.
(jocks) Liars!
- OK, Takashi, whaddaya got?
- Oh, I think I have a frush.
- What the fuck is a "frush"?
- A frush.
I got two sevens, and two sevens beats a frush.
Oh, thank you.
So, getting into a fraternity can be the most important thing in a man' s life, huh?
You know, that cheerleader set us up, Lewis.
I really don' t think Betty Childs is that kind of person, Gilbert.
Hey, Lewis?
What is it, Gilbert?
I' m really sorry that I snapped at you.
This gym' s really gettin 'to me.
It' s OK. I understand.
Tomorrow morning we' il find a better place to live, OK?
- Good night, Gilbert.
- Good night, Lewis.
- Good night, Lamar.
- Good night, Wormser.
- Good night, Takashi.
- Good night, Poindexter.
- Good night, Booger.
Hey, take it easy.
The computer' s your friend.
I wasn' t meant to interface with a machine.
Well, you' re just beginning.
Relax.
It' s no use.
It' s inhuman.
It' s not inhuman.
Only humans can be inhuman.
Here, let me show you.
Working with a computer' s great.
I mean, it' s godlike, in a way, cos you can have complete control.
- That' s good.
- Thanks.
You know, some people, they can create with their hands.
But when you' re working with a computer, you gotta build something with your mind.
If you' re good, you can do somethin 'no one' s ever seen before.
Uh... what' s your name?
- Judy.
- Hi, Judy.
Gilbert.
- (Judy) Very nice to meet you.
- Nice meeting you.
- Hello, Lewis.
- Hi, Gilbert.
- Did you find a house?
- No.
I met a girl.
Gilbert!
- Her name' s Judy.
- Judy' s a nice name, Gilbert.
She' s a nice girl.
Did you get in her pants?
- Why?
Does she have a penis?
You gonna eat this?
- Smell this one, nerd.
- Oh, Coach, Coach.
I got to find a place to live.
Is OK I leave early?
No.
Oh, OK.
- You know karate?
- No.
Good.
I' ve programmed him with all the rental units in the area.
For optimum efficiency, I' ve assigned each of you a part of the list.
This' il prevent doubling up.
We' il be able to blanket the area in no time.
Booger.
Wormser.
Toshiro.
Nerd!
- Hi.
- All right?
- Mr Wilson?
- Yeah.
Just checking.
(woman) Hi there, big boy.
Hi.
I came about the room for rent.
It' s right next to mine.
It' il be perfect for us.
(man) Who' s there?
What do you want?
- Is this the Stewart residence?
- Why are you here?
What do you want?
- I' ve come about the room.
- Go away.
- Do you have a room to rent?
- Not for rent.
- I thought it was for rent.
- Fuck off.
- Hi, Judy.
- Hi, Gilbert.
- How are you?
- Fine.
Where are you going?
I gotta go find a place to live.
- It' s horrible you having to live in the gym.
- Oh, yeah, well...
- What is that?
Is that yours?
- It' s my accordion.
- You play the accordion?
- Yeah.
- I love the accordion.
- Really?
- Are you very good, or...?
- No, not really.
I' m on my way to class.
Do you wanna walk with me?
Yeah, sure.
Here, let me get it.
- I think I found a house.
- (nerds cheer) (Booger) About fuckin 'time!
Isn' t it fantastic?
- Are you feeling anything yet, Takashi?
- Oh, Booger, I feel nothing.
You better have another hit.
Could be good.
- Feeling anything now?
- Oh, no.
I feeling... nothing... at all.
How about now?
I can' t believe what they' ve done to that house.
That' s amazing.
- Looks terrific, doesn' t it, Stan?
- Yeah, well, it won' t look terrific for long.
Huh?
I thought I was looking at my mother' s old douche bag, but that' s in Ohio.
Seven and eight.
And stretch those arms.
Come on.
Looks great.
Come on, Wormser.
- Uh.
Excuse me.
Ah, thank you very much.
OK, Takashi, show me your cards.
OK.
Two and four kings.
That' s good, yes?
No, you got too many kings.
So you gotta get rid of these here.
Take three of these kings out, and replace them with... three fresh cards.
Oh, OK.
Thank you.
- (Toshiro) When do I deal?
- (Booger) You gotta win a hand first.
I told you we' d find a better place.
Yeah.
This is way better than the dorm.
It says "Nerds get out."
What is a nerd?
We are.
I don' t know what this world is comin 'to.
You see that man over there?
We arrested him for mopery.
- What' s mopery?
- Exposing yourself to a blind person.
It' s out of my jurisdiction.
Sounds like a fraternity prank.
There' s only one organisation that can handle this.
What organisation is that?
The Greek Council.
(Dean) Our next order of business: new membership.
Earl, show the petitioners in, please.
Kneel, gentlemen.
You are the gentlemen who wish to form a fraternity?
(nerds) Yes, sir.
Gentlemen, as president of the Greek Council,
I' m sorry to inform you that your membership has been denied.
Excuse me, but... why?
According to our charter, you must have a national fraternity as your sponsor.
Do you have one?
(all) No.
- I' m afraid he' s right.
- But with a national sponsor, we' re in, right?
Right, right.
So I guess we' il see you in about, say... 20 years.
"Dear sirs, thank you for applying to Delta Kappa Gamma."
"We have gone over your application, and it wasn' t even close."
"ln the future, we recommend that you not include a group photo."
That' s 29 rejections so far.
Did we send pictures to everybody?
Yeah.
Everybody except for...
Lambda Lambda Lambda.
Here' s one that will see us.
(all) Lambda Lambda Lambda?
Yeah.
They' re gonna love us.
As you know, we have no chapter at Adams College, which is why we agreed to see you.
But I must tell you, gentlemen, you have very little chance of becoming Tri- Lambdas.
I' m in a difficult situation here.
I mean, after all... you' re nerds.
According to your bylaws, you have to take us on a 60- day trial basis.
- I beg your pardon?
- According to your bylaws...
He' s right, UN.
Any group that petitions can become a probationary Tri- Lamb chapter.
May I see that, please?
Thank you.
Well, gentlemen... you are now probationary Tri- Lambs.
- Great, UN.
Why don' t we have a party?
You can celebrate with us and observe us to make sure we' re Tri- Lamb material, OK?
- Great.
- We won' t let you down.
We' il have the highest grade- point average of any chapter you' ve got.
We certainly won' t discriminate.
Our chapter will be open to people of all races and creeds.
And sexual orientation.
Wonderful.
Hi.
Remember me?
- No.
- Well, we' re having a party Saturday night.
Would you like to come?
- No.
- Oh, well... (girls' laughter)
C' mon!
You' re shit!
You' re nothin '!
You suck!
- You' re nice!
- No, I' m not!
- What' s up, Betty?
Is somethin 'wrong?
- Yeah.
- What?
- One of those nerds just asked me out.
- Which one?
They all look alike to me.
- Yeah.
- They can' t get any dates for their party.
- Oh, yeah?
- I' il eat their ancestors.
I' il kill their parents!
Ogre!
Don' t worry about it.
Just wait a second.
Maybe we could help 'em out.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
And I know just what to do.
Come here.
We' il put the bar here, the hors d' oeuvres over there, and we' il pass the cheese puffs.
- That sounds expensive.
This party' s important.
If we don' t impress the Tri- Lambs, we' il never get in.
- Have any of you got dates, besides Gilbert?
- I do.
- Yeah, but that' s with a guy.
- What about you, Booger?
I' ve been out combing the high schools all day.
- Maybe we should cancel the party.
- No, we can' t cancel the party.
UN Jefferson' s coming.
We gotta impress him.
We' il never find dates.
# Hello, Lambda, we' re the Pis
# And we' re here to say
# We think you are special guys
# Lambdas all the way
# Alpha Betas are OK
# If you like sweat socks
# (Betty) We prefer your high lQs
# To their great big... jocks
# Lambda Lambda Lambda boys
# Really are the best
# Won' t you take a piece of Pi?
# And we' il do the rest
The sisters of Pi welcome our newest fraternity, Lambda Lambda Lambda.
We' d like to be escorts to your party Saturday night and help out in any way possible.
- We got dates!
- I' ve never been out with a girl before.
Not just a girl, Poindexter, but a Pi.
- What' s "Pi" stand for?
- Hair pie.
What' s that?
- Lewis, where are the Pis?
- I don' t know.
Their phone' s been busy for two hours.
I don' t think UN' s having a very good time.
It must be the music.
I' il put on something he' il like better.
- Great party.
- Thanks.
Where are all those sorority girls you have dates with?
You know women, they' re probably just being fashionably late.
- The Pis aren' t gonna show.
- They stood us up.
- Yeah.
- I could call my sorority sisters.
- You could?
- You think they' il come?
They' re really spontaneous people.
I' il call 'em.
Crush this ice for me, Arnold.
- Hey, guys, we got dates.
- Who?
- Judy' s gonna invite the Omega Mus over.
- Oh, no, not the Mus.
- They' re a bunch of pigs.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi there.
- Hi there.
- Hi.
- Hi.
(Judy) You can sing along.
The words are easy.
This party isn' t going very well, is it?
I don' t know why everybody' s so uptight.
I don' t know either.
Maybe we should eat.
Maybe we should watch TV.
Wonder joints.
They taste better than they look.
Oh, goody!
Oh, smile pretty, chickies.
Oh, thank you very much.
Thank you.
Hair pie.
Oh, hair pie.
Nothing.
Nothing.
I have a micon- beta link, which hooks this phone to the computer in the robot.
Hey, this is some good shit.
Hair pie?
Thank you.
Hair pie?
- You built this yourself?
- Yeah.
I think robots are sexy.
Really.
- Do you want to dance?
- OK.
Damn!
You Mus sure can party!
- Let' s go.
- Where?
- Up to your room.
- Up to my room?
Yeah.
Are you near- sighted or far- sighted?
- Near- sighted.
- So am l.
- Really?
- Yeah.
You wanna switch glasses?
- We almost have the same prescription.
- Yeah.
Um, would you like to dance?
Yeah.
Yeah, well, when I was in high school, I was thinking mostly of the aerospace field.
But then when I got into college, I decided I wanted something more challenging.
So, um, I switched to computers, and now aerodynamics is just sort of a hobby.
No, no, wait.
Would you rather live in the ascendancy of a civilisation or during its decline?
Poindexter, do you wanna fuck or not?
You know, if we get into Lambda Lambda Lambda, we could be partners in the homecoming carnival.
- That' d be so great.
This party sure worked out well.
We thought you could use some more pigs for your party, nerds.
We' il never get into Lambda Lambda Lambda now.
Those jocks ruined everything.
I say we blow their fucking houses up.
No.
We can' t resort to violence.
That' il just bring us down to their level.
- We gotta beat 'em at their own game.
We' ve gotta become the best fraternity on campus.
You know, if we win that homecoming carnival, we can take over the presidency of the Greek Council.
But, Gilbert, if we don' t get approved by the Tri- Lambs, we won' t even be a fraternity.
- I say we blow the fuckers up.
We can' t do that.
But you' re right.
Their action tonight demands an immediate retaliation.
And if we don' t, we' re nothin 'but the nerds they say we are.
I know what we' re gonna do.
(Lewis) Down, down, down.
Come on.
- Where?
- Right there.
- lsn' t this gonna make a lot of noise?
- It' s got a built- in silencer.
Camera.
Periscope.
That was fun tonight.
We were the highlight of their party.
- Those pigs were greasy.
- I have got to get the smell off.
Oh, I know.
- If Stan calls, tell him I' il call him back, OK?
- OK.
- (screams)
Hey!
Whaddaya doin '?
Gimme those back!
Come here!
Wormser, how many cameras do we have left?
- Four.
- OK.
Step aside, momma.
I wanna see some of that muff.
Hair pie.
Hair pie.
That nerd saw me naked.
Oh, out!
- lsn' t college great?
- This will be a great year.
(Betty) Bastard!
I' il kill you!
Get out, jerk!
(screams) (Lewis) We love you when you' re mad.
- Almost there, Wormser?
- (Wormser) This should do it.
- (Gilbert) Looks good.
- (Lamar) This is a stationary camera.
(Booger) We got Pis.
- You got other angles?
- Something else?
- Yeah.
- Go to the right.
Go to the right.
Arnold, that' s the girl we saw.
- (Lewis) Go up.
- (Lamar) Up?
Wait a second.
Hold it there, Lamar.
Don' t move the camera.
I drink to that.
- (Booger) Oh, yes.
- (Toshiro) Oh, that' s very good.
- (Lamar) Yeah.
(nerds snigger) (Toshiro) Oh, here she comes.
God!
Take your towel off, please.
This is bullshit.
Pan down.
We' ve got bush.
We' ve got bush.
Oh, hair pie!
I' m tired of watching 'em brush their teeth.
Dooley, throw me a beer.
Thanks.
Oh, I getting tired of Betty.
Are you kidding?
Zoom in.
I could never get tired of Betty.
How could you ever get tired of that ass, Takashi?
Oh, I see your point.
Are you guys still watching the Pis?
- (all) Yes.
- Have you been up all night?
Yes.
- Wormser, haven' t you had enough?
(Lewis) I think we got even with the Pis.
Now we got a little score to settle with the Alpha Betas.
- Shit!
Hank, what is that stuff?
- Liquid Heat.
- It burns.
- You ought to feel it when I don' t dilute it.
(Toshiro) Get them.
Make a pile here.
Don' t touch, now.
- (Gilbert) Here, hit this one.
Looks like salad.
The key to each season is homecoming.
You win that one, you got your alumni support.
You got your alumni support, you get that jock dorm, you get the laundry money, you get the new cars.
Now, this season started out fine - we won some big ball games.
But we were lucky.
We can' t get soft.
We can' t sit back on our laurels.
We win homecoming, we take league.
We take league, we get a bowl bid.
It' s as simple as that.
But, gentlemen, you have got to want it.
- Do you want it?
- (jocks yell) Yeah!
- I can' t hear you.
- Yeah!
We can' t let up.
We gotta stay tough.
You can do it.
You can do it.
You gotta believe that you can do it!
- You gotta let them know that you want it!
- I want it!
- (groans)
Shower up!
We forgot to practise.
- You put what?
- (Gilbert) Liquid Heat.
- On their what?
- In their jocks.
- That' s outrageous.
- Are you angry, UN?
No.
I' m not angry.
I' m glad to see you nerds... you guys finally fought back.
You' d make a fine addition to Tri- Lambda.
I want to welcome you aboard.
- All right!
- Oh, I will.
(braying laugh)
OK, everybody ready?
I set timer.
- (all) Hi, UN.
(Lewis) Well, I' d like to propose a toast to UN Jefferson, who, in his ultimate wisdom, chose to accept us into our new fraternity, Lambda Lambda Lambda.
Before we take this matter to a vote, I would like it clearly stated in the record...
Miss Childs... that the evidence is overwhelmingly against the Alpha Betas, and I urge that they be found guilty.
Point of order.
Dean Ulich, I am an Alpha Beta, and I know that no member of my fraternity could have perpetrated such a callous, heinous act against the nerds... or the Tri- Lambs.
Therefore, I feel a vote at this time would be, shall we say, premature.
- Premature?
- Yes.
You see, instead,
I am going to organise a special, blue- ribbon, fact- finding commission, made up of myself and...
Miss Betty Childs.
We will get to the bottom of this dastardly deed.
- Wait a minute, you can' t get away with this.
- Oh, no, I' m afraid I can.
You see, only the president of the Greek Council can call a vote.
- That' s completely unfair.
- This is bullshit!
Meeting adjourned.
Guys, we are never gonna get a fair shake as long as Stan Gable is president.
The only way to become president is to win the homecoming carnival.
That' s right, Arnold.
And that' s exactly what we' re gonna do.
I take great pleasure in officially opening this year' s homecoming carnival.
(Dean) The overall winner will be determined by total points from: number one - field events, number two - the charity fund- raising booth, and number three - the musical show and skit competition.
And now, let the games begin!
OK.
The object of the race is to complete 20 laps around the track, while stopping every lap for a mandatory pit stop, at which time the driver will chug a beer.
You don' t have a fucking chance, nerd.
- Oh, thank you.
Good luck to you, too, Burke.
- Fuck off.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
This is trichloromethalene.
It counters all effects of alcohol in your system.
- Drink the whole beer.
C' mon, Danny!
You got 'em!
Kick his ass!
- Are you feelin 'OK?
Go!
Yeah!
Come on!
- One more lap.
- It' s just you and the Alpha Betas.
- Danny, let that nerd beat you, you' re nothin '!
- No sweat.
- He no stand no chance now.
- Go, Takashi!
Go on!
Let' s go, Burke!
All right!
Go!
(Ogre) Ah, man, he' s wasted!
(Stan) Come on, Burke!
You' re an Alpha Beta!
Oh, I won!
Times are changin ', Betty.
These nerds are a threat to our way of life.
If they win homecoming, they' il take over the Greek Council.
And we' il be up to our necks in nerd shit!
(Dean on PA) Our next competition will be the Trojan Horse.
C' mon!
Get off!
Get off!
What are those Alpha Betas doing?
Set.
Ooh, ah... (Coach) On your mark.
You win.
I' m not too wild about this next event, but it has become a tradition here at Adams.
The belching contest.
Our first of two finalists, Frederick W Polowoski.
Ogre You Asshole.
Ogre.
- Booger.
- Booger.
Our next event goes all the way back to the Peloponnesian War - the javelin throw.
- All right, baby!
- What did you expect?
You won it.
- (Gilbert) Wait for Lamar' s throw.
- (Judy) How come?
Wormser' s a master at aerodynamics.
He designed the javelin to fit with Lamar' s limp- wristed throwing style.
Wormser, it worked!
I can' t believe it.
Did you see that?
I love you all.
I love you all.
Thank you.
Thank you.
(Dean on PA) The Alpha Beta- Pi team leads.
The Lambda- Mus are a surprising second.
Now let' s see what happens at the charity fund- raising booths.
Eat a Pi for charity.
C' mon, let' s go!
Take a break, Chip.
Hi.
- Hi, Betty.
- A nerd.
- I' m not kissing a nerd.
- You have to.
I' ve paid my money.
It' s time for my break.
Kiss this, nerd.
- Yeah?
I wanna do it.
All this kissing' s made me horny.
God, Betty.
You' re like a goat.
Next.
Stan!
Changed your mind.
I' m glad.
Come on.
D' you wanna do it on the moon?
Take off your mask.
Oh, Stan.
You' re so kinky.
(Booger) Eat a Pi for charity.
C' mon, step right up.
C' mon, step up.
Eat Pi for charity.
Thank you very much.
Eat a Pi for charity.
- Gable, how we doing?
- Great.
1258 bucks.
Better than last year.
- The nerds are over 2, 000.
- For selling pies?
They got a line around the corner.
Guys are buying two, three pies apiece.
There' s something fishy about these pies.
C' mon, let' s go check it out.
This can' t be.
Ogre, go get a pie.
Find out what the hell' s goin 'on here.
Thanks, wimp.
Get yourself one.
- Well?
How is it?
- Is it good or is it great?
- It' s good.
Just good?
Then what they sellin 'so many for?
Uh- oh.
That' s my Pi.
Oh, Stan!
That was wonderful.
You did things to me you' ve never done before.
- You' re that nerd!
- Yeah.
God, you were wonderful.
Thanks.
- Are all nerds as good as you?
- Yes.
How come?
Cos all jocks think about is sports.
All we ever think about is sex.
- What' s your name?
- Lewis.
Lewis... would you meet me after the pep rally tonight?
Sure.
(Dean on PA) It' s all tied up.
The musical and skit competition will decide the winner.
So, let the music begin!
# Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream
# Life is but a dream (cheering and applause)
What did the Pink Panther say when he stepped on an ant?
(# "Pink Panther" tune) Dead ant.
Dead ant, dead ant, dead ant.
What is the dirtiest thing ever said on television?
Tell me.
"Ward, I think you were a little hard on the Beaver last night."
(all chant) Gable, Gable, he' s our man.
If he can' t do it, Burke can.
If he can' t do it, Ogre can.
- What' s that spell?
- Adams!
# They always call him Mr Touchdown
# They always call him Mr T
# He can run and kick and throw
# Give him the ball and just look at him go
# Hip, hip, hooray for Mr Touchdown
# He' s gonna beat 'em today
# So give a great big cheer for the hero of the year
# Mr Touchdown USA
Hurrah!
# Clap your hands, everybody And everybody clap your hands
# We' re Lambda Lambda Lambda and Omega Mu
# We come here on stage tonight to do our show for you
# We got a rockin 'rhythm and a hi- tech sound
# That' il make you move your body down to the ground
# We got Poindexter on the violin And Lewis and Gilbert will be joinin 'in
# We got Booger Presley on a mean guitar And a rap by little old me, Lamar
# We got Takashi beating on his gong
# The boys and the Mus are clappin 'along
# And just when you thought you' d seen it all
# Along comes a Lambda four foot tall
# So, Wormser, come on out here on the floor
# So we can work our bodies like never before
I' d like to present the trophy to this year' s champions,
Lambda Lambda Lambda and Omega Mu.
They will be able to select the president of next year' s Greek Council.
I' d like to announce we' ve made our selection already.
It' s Gilbert Lowe!
This sucks!
I gotta get rid of this anger.
C' mon, Betty, let' s pump iron.
No, Stan.
I don' t think so.
What d' you mean, you don' t think so?
Why not?
I' ve got a date with a Tri- Lamb.
- A Tri- Lamb!
- Here' s your pin.
Take it.
Wait.
Betty...
C' mon.
God!
I' m in love with a nerd!
- Gable.
- Yeah, Coach.
I wanna see you and the other girls in the locker room now!
Yes, sir.
You know, when you were a baby in your crib, your father looked down at you, he had but one hope -
"Someday my son will grow to be a man."
Well, look at you now.
You just got your asses whipped by a bunch of goddamn nerds.
Nerds!
Well, if I was you, I' d do something about it.
I would get up and redeem myself in the eyes of my father, my Maker and my coach!
- Let' s get those nerds!
- Nerds!
Nerds!
What are we waitin 'for?!
# We' re Lambda Lambda Lambda and Omega Mu (chanting) Nerds!
I' m a nerd.
Welcome to the real world.
I never really wanted to believe that.
- It' s OK.
- It' s not OK.
We' re nothing.
We let them destroy our house.
- We' il control the Greek Council next year.
- Big deal!
You' il be dead by then, Gilbert.
Nobody cares.
Don' t you understand that?
The university doesn' t care.
There' s nothin 'we can do about it.
We got something good goin ', and I won' t let' em take it away from us.
Gilbert, don' t be a fool.
You' il just get yourself hurt again.
- Big deal.
- Gilbert?
I' d like to introduce the men that will bring you a homecoming victory against State tomorrow.
At defensive back, number 38, Kevin O' Leary.
Offensive guard, number 64, Rich Valrow.
At centre, number 53, Harry Reagan.
- Look who' s comin '.
- Where you goin '?
You went way too far this time, and you' re not gettin 'away with it.
Oh, is that right?
Well, let' s see if shit floats.
What do you think of that idea?
Come on!
Put me down!
Goddamn!
Put me down!
Now our tri- captains.
Leading the conference in reception, at wide receiver, number 84, Danny Burke.
Our defensive captain, number 79, Fred Polowoski - the Ogre.
Now our two- time all- American quarterback, number ten, Stan Gable.
Hold it, son.
Hold it, hold it!
Leave him alone.
Coach, I said leave him alone.
What did you say?
I' il break his goddamn neck.
You will do nothing of the sort.
Don' t touch that boy.
Says who?
Says me... you asshole.
Hold it, Coach.
You just hold it right there.
OK, kid.
Say what you gotta say.
Thanks.
I just wanted to say that... that I' m a nerd.
And I' m here tonight to stand up for the rights of other nerds.
I mean, all our lives we' ve been laughed at and made to feel inferior.
And tonight those bastards, they trashed our house.
Why?
Because we' re smart?
Because we look different?
Well, we' re not.
I' m pretty proud of it.
Hi, Gilbert.
I' m a nerd, too.
I just found that out tonight.
We have news for the beautiful people.
There' s a lot more of us than there are of you.
I know there' s alumni here tonight.
When you went to Adams, you might have been called a spaz, or a dork, or a geek.
Any of you that have ever felt... stepped on, left out, picked on, put down, whether you think you' re a nerd or not, why don' t you come and join us?
Come on.
- Hi, Betty.
- Hi.
Just join us, cos, uh...
Hi.
(Gilbert) No one' s really gonna be free until nerd persecution ends.
You know, Coach, I think I' m gonna let these boys live over at the Alpha Beta house, while you and your boys rebuild theirs.
- And where the hell are we gonna live?
- What about us, huh?
You' re jocks, go live in the gym.
(all, softly) Nerd.
Nerd.
(all chant loudly) Nerd!
Nerd!

Wondermutt, go get Bob.
Hey, guys!
You all got your grade cards, right?
OK.
What have we learned this year?
Teamwork, sportsmanship, how your friends look naked.
You' il notice your grade cards are blank.
Who better to evaluate a student' s progress than the student himself?
Good morning, young people.
Mr. Gills.
Thank you, Principal Kelban.
Well, well, I suppose you all remember the English skills test last month.
- No.
- No.
- I had English?
- The dot- to- dot puzzle?
Yeah, that was it, yeah.
No, I don' t remember.
I' m not surprised.
All of you failed.
However, in accordance with policies on minimum academic proficiencies, you' il have the opportunity to retake the exam.
- Great.
- Oh, joy, I have a boner now.
I' m all packed.
Are you ready?
- One minute to go.
In summer school.
- What?
- We just finished a whole semester and we gotta go to summer school?
- You' re crazy.
I ain' t going.
- My grandmother' s gonna kill me.
Twenty, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, fourteen, 13, 12, eleven, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one!
I won!
I won!
I won!
I won!
Gills, Kelban.
I did it, I did it.
Look at this puppy.
50, 000 big ones.
Know what this means?
No summer school.
Wait, you gave me your word.
That was the old word.
My new one is "money".
You would let 50 grand weaken your commitment to education?
Lesser men win millions, go right back to busing tables!
They' re frigging morons!
Let me out of here!
Let me out of here!
Don' t look at me.
You' re in charge of summer school.
- May I speak with you a minute?
- Sure.
I need you to teach summer school.
Dearadorian just quit.
- Didn' t he teach remedial English?
- Well, yes...
Winnick!
Musway!
Stop!
Stop!
Mary!
I have to talk to you.
Kim, get in the car.
It' s OK.
I' il meet you at the airport.
I' il get a cab.
Take Wondermutt.
Shoop.
All right.
Oh, Mr. Shoop.
Congratulations.
You' ve been chosen to teach summer school.
Shoot.
If only I' d known sooner.
- We' re going to Hawaii.
- May I remind you, Mr. Shoop, you' re up for tenure.
You want a job next year?
Come on, Mr. Gills.
Look, we got leis on and everything.
You' il be teaching remedial English.
Remedial English?
Look, I ain' t no English teacher.
See?
Double negative.
No, I hand out basketballs, check for jockstraps.
I' m, like, very challenged.
- I' m not a real teacher.
- That' s all right.
These aren' t real students.
They' re unmotivated, irresponsible.
- They' il relate to you.
- I appreciate that.
No, the reason I got into this whole teaching gig was to get summers off.
No, I' m afraid my answer has to be no.
No, thank you?
Bottom line, you need my recommendation for tenure.
This is blackmail.
We call it school spirit.
Kim.
Have you ever seen The Wizard of Oz?
- Yeah.
Yeah, me too.
And my favorite part is when Dorothy, she clicks her heels together and she says, "There' s no place like home.
"There is no place like home."
Oh, Shoop, I understand.
You do?
You' re not disappointed?
No.
I' il just go by myself.
- What, alone?
- I' il make friends.
Look, Kim, if you love me, even if you just like me a lot, you won' t do this.
If I didn' t like you, I wouldn' t ask you to drive me to the airport, now would I?
Guess not.
You' re in room 43.
Files on your students.
A word to the wise, Mr. Shoop:
Right off the bat, you show them who' s in charge.
Great.
Who is in charge?
Very cute.
Thanks.
So are you.
Oh, you meant...
Jeez, I' m so embarrassed.
But you are cute.
I' m all right.
I' m Robin Bishop.
I teach American history next door.
Hi, Freddy Shoop.
Remedial English, right here.
Everybody calls me Shoop.
OK, Shoop.
Why am I here?
Oh, thumbtacks.
Could I borrow some?
Sure.
I was just gonna get my summer bulletin board going here.
Jackpot.
Whole box.
Here you go, my treat.
- But what about your bulletin board?
Give me one.
Remedial English, huh?
I got it easy, I have honor students.
They' re here voluntarily.
- Believe it?
- No.
I' ve seen some of your students.
Very scary.
You must be a good teacher.
Shucks, Robin, I don' t know.
Heck, inside every so- called bad kid is a good kid waiting for someone to reach down through the sleaze and slime, pick him up and hose him off.
If we fail with even one child, we might be losing the next Ted Koppel.
We' re the unsung heroes doing God' s work.
You' re not wearing a wedding ring.
Yeah, my mother noticed that too.
So you' re single.
In love?
Involved?
What' s the story here?
The story is that I' ve been seeing someone.
But we just started dating, so you do what you think' s right.
- OK.
- I better get going.
Well, here, I' il walk you.
So you' re free to see other people, then?
Are you asking me out?
- Well, if I was, would you say yes?
- I might.
Well, I might be asking you out.
- You like Chinese?
- I hate it.
Me too.
I can' t stand it.
Wanna go out and not eat Chinese?
I might.
Why don' t we talk about that after school.
I' m in love again.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
The crowd goes mild.
- Hey, wow.
- Kevin?
- What happened to football, buddy?
- Yeah.
I was kicked off the team for being stupid.
All right, it' s about time.
Congratulations, bud.
Sorry I' m late.
Hey, Mr. Shoop, wow.
You in this class too?
- I' m teaching it.
- No way!
Party all the time Party all the time
My girl likes to party all the time
All right, have a seat.
Let' s see who the lucky winners are.
Larry Kazimias.
Where' s Larry?
He' s nocturnal.
Oh, OK.
Try and keep it down.
Francis Gremp?
Don' t ever call me that.
The name is Chainsaw.
- As in Black & Decker?
- As in Texas Massacre.
- Oh, yeah, that' s in here.
- It' s in there.
- They got files on us.
- Pam House.
Says here you lack concentration.
Pam?
Never mind.
Jerome Watkins.
Computer said I failed that test.
The computer made an error.
I recommend this time, I pass.
You' re gonna do well, Jerome.
I can feel it.
- Alan Eakian.
- Present, sir.
Four brothers, two sisters, all straight- A students.
What are you doing here?
I assume there was some sort of a baby mix- up at the hospital.
- Rhonda Altobello.
- Here.
You went from C' s to F' s.
What happened?
Any other questions?
No.
- Denise Green.
- What' s that file say about me?
It' s a lie.
What you want to know?
- Where are my car keys?
- How would I know?
What, does that thing say I' m a thief too?
All right, where are my car keys?
- Chainsaw?
- Somewhere in this room.
Right now you' re very cold.
- You' re really cold.
- I want those keys.
Oh, God, you' re freezing.
OK.
OK, I' m a fun guy.
I' il play along.
- Getting warmer.
- You are getting hot, man.
- Oh, I see smoke.
- You are on fire!
Oh, you' re walking on the sun!
Ouch!
Oh, wait.
You' re ice- cold.
Enough of this shit.
Does that mean we can swear in class?
- Shit, yes!
- Hey, watch your fucking language!
Watch your language, fart- face!
- Where are my keys?
- There' s the dick- brain that knows.
If I knew anything, would I be in this butt- hole class?
Suck my loggerhead.
Damn it!
- Jizzum- head!
- Jizzum- head.
Yeah, good one.
One of my all- time faves.
Psychology.
You give a child the license to swear, they lose all interest in it.
- I certainly did.
- You' re full of bull.
It' s OK, you can say "bullshit" in here.
I' m grateful.
I' m sure you' re aware that I' m teaching next door.
And this swearing is getting a little loud.
Yes!
Yes, that' s the idea.
Thank you.
I don' t think she likes you.
I want my car keys.
I' m using the lavatory.
- This is worse than a gas station.
- Yeah, I think I have to go too.
Wait a minute.
Hey, wait a...
My keys.
Thattaboy, Mr. Shoop.
Hey.
Hey!
OK, I' m calling roll and then I' m gonna...
Where' s my roll sheet?
It' s somewhere in this room.
Hey.
Sorry about the noise.
I' m really a gym teacher.
I don' t belong in a classroom.
Apology accepted.
See you later.
Let' s start all over.
Hi, I' m Freddy Shoop.
Look, you' re a semi- charming guy and a snappy dresser.
- You' re not the kind of guy I date.
What kind are you dating?
- Oh, the kind who wears socks.
- I got a pair somewhere.
White ones.
So about dinner, you like Italian?
Mexican?
Hey, maybe you' d rather cook.
I' m not having dinner with you.
- OK, lunch.
- Robin.
Excuse me just one second.
Robin, about tonight, the concert starts at 8.
I thought we' d go to the beach and have a picnic.
- Watch the sunset.
- Sounds wonderful.
Oh, bye- bye, Freddy.
I' il be darned.
You' re a heterosexual.
And a damned good one.
- Good luck, honey.
- Thanks, Mom.
OK, start her up.
Make a right, please.
These photos suck.
Weddings, graduations.
- Hoffman came in.
- Yeah.
It' s more of the redhead with the tattoo.
This time he' s got her making breakfast stark raving naked.
Oh, Hoffman, you' re so sick.
Check out this composition.
Round English muffin, square butter, triangular bush.
The man is an artist.
- Reprints.
- Reprints.
Hi, I' d like to sign up for Lamaze classes.
OK, how are Tuesday nights for you and your coach?
- Perfect, but I don' t have a coach.
- Well, what about the father?
Well, that' s sort of confusing.
It' s either David Lee Roth, who' s on tour, or Sean Penn.
And I' d really hate to upset Madonna.
Fill this out.
OK.
How far did we get yesterday?
You took roll.
Right.
That shouldn' t take as long today.
Pam.
- Mr. Shoop, I gotta book.
- What?
You just got here.
Yeah.
- It' s a female thing.
- Oh, yeah, I understand.
Oh, man, she' s going surfing!
I' m sure.
Fuck.
This menstruation deal, it' s such a scam.
Girls are so lucky.
What?
Oh, we' re so lucky?
You think being on your period is some picnic?
Are you crazy?
You get PMS, there' s no room in your purse for no hairbrush because you got these mini pads.
You are so ignorant!
This whole class is jammed with ignorance.
Yes, it is.
Come in here, please.
Mr. Shoop, this is our new foreign exchange student,
Anna- Maria Mazarelli.
Anna- Maria is from Milan, Italy.
She would like to brush up her English skills before the fall semester begins.
Please.
Anna- Maria, welcome to America.
You can sit wherever you want.
You looking for a seat?
Well, now, this desk appears to be unoccupied.
Grazie.
OK, let' s see what we got here.
"Rules of grammar."
"Writing paragraphs."
God, I hate this stuff.
"Book reports."
Wanna get out of here?
Go to the library?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Let' s go.
I am Chainsaw.
Hi, Chainsaw.
- Hi, I' m Dave.
- Ciao.
- Well, we love Italy.
- Yeah.
- The pizza.
- Mussolini.
- And Tony Bennett.
- The Mafia.
Chef Boyardee.
- Pinocchio.
- Fellatio.
Oh, I don' t like that.
- Well, have you ever tried it?
- Sure.
It' s so mushy.
Anna- Maria?
Have you seen the movie Texas Chainsaw Massacre?
No.
It is good?
Oh, I gotta tell you, I love this film.
It had passion and a plucky spirit.
And the characters had integrity.
Like when Leatherface went on a strict diet of human flesh.
- He had to cut out chicken and fish.
- I agree with you.
I' il go a step further.
Leatherface wore a mask made out of human skin, he hung people on meat hooks, but we' ve all got quirks.
I' ve got them.
You got them.
That' s what makes this character so compelling.
- Thumbs up from me.
- Same here.
- To sum it up, I' m Chainsaw.
- I' m Dave.
We' il see you at the movies.
- OK.
- Let' s go, people.
I found them at Winchell' s.
Here, we all chipped in.
Hey, jelly.
I' m touched.
This one was in the parking lot with a surfboard.
This is so humiliating.
Pam.
You know, I grew up surfing those same waves.
Today was phenom.
Three to four, breaking out of the south, glassy, light offshore breeze.
Had to go for the ditch.
Thanks.
You' re very spiritual.
But the rest of you clowns...
Hey, I gotta say something.
This whole thing is a joke.
There' s a very valid reason for summer vacation.
The human brain needs rest.
Yeah.
I mean, what are we doing here?
- Really.
I don' t wanna be here.
- Hey, look, this wasn' t my idea.
I wouldn' t know what to do if you were.
But we' re stuck here.
We' re trapped like rats.
Anybody got any ideas?
Why don' t we take some field trips?
- Can we do that?
- Sure, yeah.
I got permission slips right here.
OK, take these home, have your mom or dad sign them, I' il see what I can do.
- Done.
- Same here.
Good.
The Screwdriver was a disappointment.
I was hoping for a headache or pounding temples, a blackout, but, you know, I feel fine.
Actually, my headache is gone.
Thumbs down.
I' m surprised.
I found the Screwdriver simply delightful.
Fast corners.
The line moved fast.
Is he OK?
No, it appears that he' s vomiting.
That' s a sure sign of a good ride.
Thumbs up.
Eakian, what did you eat?
No.
Hey!
Hey, you slime.
Stones' first farewell tour, '69.
Get out of here.
- Oh, wait.
- He ripped my T- shirt.
Oh, I can sew that.
It' s not necessary.
Go away!
Nothing' s necessary.
I want to.
Great, I' il let you.
Get them off!
Get them off me!
The bunnies from hell!
Oh, God!
Get away from me!
Oh, dear!
- Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
- Thank you very much.
What is this?
It' s a lie.
- We did this for you.
- How did you like it?
It' s disgusting!
I love it.
- What is that?
- Oh, it' s foam latex.
Keep it.
You guys.
Next field trip, it' s gotta be at the beach.
We gotta see Anna- Maria in a bikini.
It' s very important.
I understand.
Girl, this ain' t the Riviera.
Thank you.
That was...
That was...
That was cruel.
You OK?
Come in, come in, Mrs. Eakian.
Now, how can I help you?
Yesterday Alan came home nauseous, sneezing, wheezing and itching, with goat hairs on his clothes.
He said he was at the museum,
- but I found this in his pocket.
- Grandma...
Is going on throw- up rides and rubbing barnyard animals your idea of quality education?
- Grandma...
- Certainly not.
We' il talk to Mr. Shoop about this right now.
I may have used poor judgment.
You actually used judgment.
Do you realize if anything happened to these kids, the lawsuits?
You could' ve bankrupt the entire district!
And mess up your chance at election to state assembly?
- Yes.
- Don' t wet your pants.
Watch this.
All you had to do was babysit some social deviants.
Those deviants are great kids.
I' m sure they' il grow up to be wonderful criminals.
- They' re as smart as you and me.
- You and I.
All of us.
You' re suspended until Kelban returns and fires you.
What?
Hey, this is your fault.
You knew I couldn' t teach.
Goodbye, Mr. Shoop.
Gills, what if I become a model teacher?
This is gonna be fun.
OK.
You get every kid left in your class to pass that skills test and I' il forget about your field trips.
Done.
- They all have to pass?
- It' s called teaching.
If you don' t know how to do that, then I guess you don' t deserve tenure.
Do you?
I' il teach.
Morning, class.
Nice tie!
Oh, baby.
Mr. Shoop, what' s with the threads, man?
You getting married?
Nothing else was clean.
- Funeral?
- Could we come?
Please take your seats.
- Where should we take them?
- Sit down, Francis.
From this moment forth, you people eat English, sleep English.
You are English.
Oh, then pass the crumpets, old boy.
I' m not kidding around.
Anyone not interested in passing that exam can leave right now.
The guy' s been pretty cool.
He called me Francis.
Hasta luego, Placido Domingo.
Chainsaw, Dave, wait a minute.
Look, Gills is having a cow about our field trips.
Memorex.
Anybody got any ideas here?
Get yourself some want ads.
I don' t care what your files say.
You are not that dumb.
Actually, Mr. Shoop, those files are usually right on the money.
- You all feel that way?
- I do.
- I may as well go home.
- Mr. Shoop?
Look, we don' t want you to lose your job.
Think about what you' re asking.
- You want us to study?
- The thought did cross my mind.
- Well, what' s in it for us?
- Literacy.
Oh, sorry, that' s...
- I' d like to help.
What can I do?
- Give me your car.
- Your house.
- And your dog.
- See you.
Mr. Shoop, wait!
There' s room to negotiate.
What if you granted each one of us one wish?
What do you mean, "wish"?
You know, like a favor.
Does anybody need anything?
I need somebody to work out with, in case I get back on the team.
- I need some driving lessons.
Bad.
OK, there' s two of us.
Therefore, we get two.
All right.
One, a party, your house, Fourth of July weekend.
In Anna- Maria' s honor.
Number two, you arrange a screening, in class, of the greatest movie ever made.
The 1973 Tobe Hooper classic The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
- That is also in Anna- Maria' s honor.
- Thank you.
Now, then, is there anything that you desire?
Oh, I don' t deserve a wish.
I don' t take the test anyway.
God, she is so honest.
We' il take hers.
Chauffeur service for Dave and I, every day, to and from work.
Pam, what' s your wish?
I' il tell Mr. Shoop when the time is right.
Larry?
- Larry, what do you want?
- Bed.
He wants a bed.
As for myself, I just wanna be invited to the party.
- We' il see.
- Good enough.
I think these are fair and reasonable requests.
In return, we' il show up, we' il pay attention and we' il even do a little homework.
- Is this contract acceptable to labor?
- No doubt.
- Yeah.
- Does management agree?
- You sure I' m management?
- For our purposes here, yes.
Do we have a binding agreement?
We got something.
All right.
Well, we put that baby to bed.
Let' s do lunch.
I always wanted to say that.
- Well, go ahead.
Teach.
- Right.
Teach.
Don' t anybody move.
- Beagman?
- Excuse me, Miss Bishop.
- Mr. Shoop.
Shouldn' t you be planning a field trip to 7- Eleven?
I need your help.
I know how you feel about me, but something really bizarre has happened to my kids.
- All right.
- All right.
If I get next door and there' s a candlelight dinner, I' m calling security.
- The 1970 Seabed Treaty.
Do you own that suit?
- What did you do, pass out Valiums?
- This is a natural lull.
Interesting phenomenon.
What do you want from me?
How do you teach?
- If you' re serious, I' il help you.
- Great.
Meet me after school.
We' il make plans for the weekend.
For the weekend?
OK.
The easiest thing to do is base your lesson plans on the students' own experiences.
- I can do that.
Hardly.
I' m telling you, you gotta try these Pop- Tarts.
No, thanks.
I' m sticking with the Chocodiles.
The best teachers are the teachers who entertain while they teach.
- So you should do just fine.
- You think I' m entertaining?
To children.
- I gotta go.
Time' s up.
- I know why you' re helping me.
- Professional courtesy.
You like me.
- No, I don' t.
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don' t.
- Yeah, you do.
- Do not.
- Do too.
- Don' t either.
- Come on.
- Don' t you like me just a little bit?
- No.
Not even that much?
I like you that much.
It' s a start.
Now, someone tell me why learning how to write is so critical.
- It' s a form of communication.
And it can get you free stuff.
- Free?
- Free.
I' m writing the word...... free.
Here' s how it works.
All of us have been ripped off, right?
Pay phone steals money, not enough cheese on your pizza.
- My shades keep falling apart.
- Perfect.
You' il see action, if your letter is clearly written and threatens to hurt their business.
And is signed, forgive me, Chainsaw,
"Mr. Francis Gremp, president, Consumer Against Faulty Eyewear."
You want me to lie?
OK.
Anyone interested in learning the correct form, please turn to page 46 in your textbook.
The shit works.
Damn!
Stupid son of a...
- I' m not cut out to be a linebacker.
- No, you' re looking at my shoulders.
Don' t.
Focus on my waist.
OK?
My waist.
All right, try it again.
Go on.
That' s good.
Remember, I' m your teacher.
You wanna learn how to surf?
- You sure you wanna do this?
- Absolutely.
Lamaze class, great place to meet girls.
OK, Denise, slide over.
Oh, no, no, no.
Is this some kind of sick, twisted joke?
No, I' m combining Denise' s driving lesson with your ride to the beach.
We took driver training with Denise.
Call us a cab.
Get your grisly butts in the car.
Man, let me drive.
I' m going for my license next week.
- Chainsaw, you' ve been drinking.
- No, it' s cough medicine.
Check out this phlegm.
Save the phlegm.
You' re not driving anywhere.
I' il tell you something.
You know why so many drunk drivers get in wrecks?
- They don' t learn to drive drunk.
- Fact:
Alcohol kills brain cells.
You lose one more, you' re a talking monkey.
Come on, get in.
Come on.
OK, Denise, start her up.
Signal left.
Pull on out.
Can I call my folks and say I won' t be home... ever?
I' m not used to this car.
I think it' s safe.
Move it out.
Nice and smooth.
Oh, yeah, that' s...
Fine.
Good.
- Why did you do that?
- A car was coming.
Well, it' il happen from time to time.
Come on, Denise, he won' t bother us.
We just got lapped by an old lady with a walker.
- See that space between those cars?
- Yeah.
- Pull in.
- Parallel park?
That' s my weak spot.
Listen to her.
OK.
- I' m sober now.
- We live!
- We live!
It' s beautiful.
Enough safe and sane.
It' s time for dumb and dangerous.
These are Mexican.
You do not know what' s in these babies.
Hey, get me a brew.
Coming through.
Anna- Maria, as far as we know, this has never, ever been attempted.
Anna- Maria, we dedicate these cantaloupe to you.
You make fruit bombs for me?
Oh, how sweet.
- Melon balls, coming up!
- We' re gonna make these babies fly!
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
You' re awake.
I wanna talk.
- Not now, babe, I' m late.
- Late for what?
What' s it like being pregnant?
- Bizarre.
- Yeah, that' s what I thought.
My body is out of control and it' s big and ugly.
- I think you look great.
- Sure, in the dark.
How much longer?
About five weeks.
- It' s gonna be amazing.
- Yeah, I know.
You' il be a mother.
Yeah.
Eakian, this party' s getting weak.
Do something wild.
Take all your clothes off.
Why?
You want everyone to go home?
You' re almost fun tonight.
Almost.
- You all right?
Come on in.
I' m just resting up.
Too much fun.
It' s all sewn.
Hey, thanks.
That' s great.
- I feel so at home here.
- Yeah, me too.
Yeah.
The grunion are running tonight.
In the dead of night, under a full moon, thousands of horny little fish swim hundreds of miles to ball their brains out in the sand.
It' s so romantic.
You ever do that with one of your students?
No.
I swim hundreds of miles, I' m ready for a nap.
Who' s that?
Oh, it' s Kim.
She' s sort of my girlfriend.
- "Sort of"?
- Well, she' s in Hawaii.
So you' re all alone and you like young girls.
Kim' s not that young.
She' s 21.
I' m 16.
Because there' s, like, no difference between 21 and 16 now, but when she' s 66, I' il only be 61.
And I' il be 75 and it won' t matter anyway.
Yeah.
Come on, Pam.
Time for more fun.
Wondermutt!
Out of my way!
Watch your ass, folks!
Banzai!
- Oh, shit.
- Fire!
Do something!
- Jesus Christ, my couch is on fire!
- Come on, Dave.
What?
What?
What?
- All right, we took care of it.
- My fish!
- How many were there?
- One.
Poor fishy.
Get rid of that couch.
That is a definite fire hazard.
- Definitely.
- Party' s over.
It was just getting good.
We got a fire...
Good night!
One little fire.
Big deal.
- Minors drinking on the beach.
- Seriously, we never do this.
Boy, never, ever.
There' s our English teacher, let' s ask him.
Mr. Shoop, sir, could you come here just a moment, please?
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.
- What' s up?
- Found these boys with alcohol.
That alcohol, officer?
Oh, that' s not theirs.
Whose is it?
It' s mine.
See, I live in that house right there and they were just watching my stuff.
It' s his.
We should never have taken those little baby sips.
That was wrong.
God, so very, very wrong.
I think they learned one hell of a lesson, officer.
Next time you boys encounter alcohol, remember you' re underage.
- Yes, sir, we will.
- Yeah, of course, thank...
Thank you.
- Well, we' re off to do our homework.
- Yeah.
Bye.
- We shouldn' t have tried this.
- It was a mistake.
That was bad.
We should' ve just said no.
- You guys are good men.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
You' re under arrest for contributing to the delinquency of a minor.
- Officer, that' s not really my vodka.
- Is that your dog?
- Yeah.
- No dogs on the beach, $50 fine.
He' s not really my dog.
He just thinks he' s my dog.
No, he' s a neighborhood dog.
He hangs out at my place because there' s garbage there.
He' il eat anything.
He' s a beach dog, really.
Go away, beach dog.
Do you have a cell for beginners?
- Boogie boy.
- Bunk in here.
- Moondoggie.
- Yeah.
Who wants gum?
Leave your message after the beep.
Robin, it' s your pal, Shoop.
I can' t leave my number because I' m downtown in jail.
- Jail?
- What, you' re surprised?
I got arrested in my swim trunks, so I need 50 bucks and a pair of shoes.
Listen, please don' t mention this to that bite in the ass Gills.
You' re an angel.
Dinner, dancing, Paris...
Hello, Mr. Shoop.
- Who is this?
- The bite in the ass.
When I say "bite in the ass", I mean that in the nicest possible way.
Can I talk to Robin?
I' m afraid Robin and I are on our way out of town.
But don' t worry, we' il be right over.
He' s still a human being, Phillip.
We have a very long drive.
And that' s OK with me, we' il be stuck in traffic.
And that' s OK with me, because we' il be helping Shoop and you won' t think I' m a shit.
Right?
Am I in really big trouble?
Arrested for contributing to the delinquency of minors?
You' re not a hero.
What is this?
I made a new friend.
And it is ugly.
Mr. Shoop' s been making a lot of progress in his class, Phillip.
It' s true.
I' ve been handing out assignments and the kids turn them in.
- It' s almost like school in there.
- I' ve heard.
And I' m proud.
Confirms all my instincts about him.
He' s my boy.
Robin, let' s get out of here.
We' re on our way to wine country.
You kids have fun.
See those waves, Wondermutt?
They' re from Hawaii.
Kim' s in Hawaii.
Robin' s in the wine country.
You know what we need?
I mean, besides bread.
We need a woman who will appreciate what we have to offer.
A woman of culture...... intellect.
Shake those buns, baby!
Bring those buns over here.
Mama' s got some software for you, baby.
Excuse me.
I' m with Playgirl magazine.
Survey me later, I' m trying to concentrate.
Come on, baby.
Thanks for your time.
Shoot them buns over here.
Hey!
Hey, cowboy!
Don' t I know you?
Hey, back off, hair- bag, this is ladies' night.
I love him, I love him, I love him.
Larry!
Mr. Shoop.
What are you doing here?
What am I doing here?
You do this every night?
Well, we have Mondays off.
Listen, man, you can' t tell anybody, OK?
They think I' m 21.
You were fabulous.
This is from both of us.
I' m in the wrong business.
But about school, if you could sneak in a couple hours' sleep, you' d catch up.
Mr. Shoop, man, think about what you' re saying.
I mean, if you could be 17 again, only you knew then what you know now.
- Yeah.
- Well, I know.
I hate that kid.
"Who we admire most in the world and why.
"The person we admire most in the world is makeup artist
"and creature creator Rick Baker."
"His wonderfully gruesome slime bladders and slobber tubes
"in American Werewolf in London won him a richly deserved Oscar.
"That is why we admire makeup artist and creature creator Rick Baker
"Very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very..."
- It' s 100 words on the nose.
- You can count if you want.
"It is not easy to pick the person I admire most.
"I admire people for different reasons.
"The way they surf or teach English from the heart or help the homeless.
"To pick one person is so unfair to everyone else.
"Isn' t there enough pain in the world?"
Since there' s no one I admire most, this is about a person I admire least, my ex- boyfriend, Andre.
If he tells you he broke up with me, he' s lying, because I told him to get out of my face first.
You know how I could tell when he' s lying?
His lips move.
I' m serious.
He' s so in love with himself, he ought to be dating a mirror.
He' s in skin- tight leather pants, thinking he' s Rick James' little brother.
Give the world a break.
- Denise, can I have your paper?
- No.
- No?
looking for money and homework.
That happens.
Field trip next Monday.
Where are we going, cockfights?
Courthouse.
Your teacher was arrested for giving vodka to some kids.
You and Dave won' t want to miss it.
- You went to jail for us?
- On roller skates.
Thanks, man.
Pam?
Hi.
What are you doing here?
Remember I said I' d tell you my wish when the time was right?
It' s right.
- Your wish is to move in with me?
- I' m a great cook.
I won' t get in your way.
You know we connect.
- Pam, look, my place is very small.
- It' s perfect.
Look, Tommy, that' s my brother, he had another kid and Angela, she' s his wife, wants to move the twins back into Gail' s room and put Sally in the den, so I lose the couch.
- Yeah, well, my couch is barbecued.
- The floor is fine.
Mr. Shoop, everybody else got their wish.
OK, Pam.
If I let you stay here, it' s only temporary until you find another place, OK?
I can stay.
Who are you talking to?
This is Tommy and Angela and Gail and Sally and Sly and the twins, Chuck and Bob, and Tommy, Jr.
This is Mr. Shoop.
- How are you?
- Pleased to meet you.
She screams so well.
Oh, don' t be a wuss.
Shut up!
Run, run.
Larry!
Larry, wake up, you' re missing this.
Larry' s not missing a thing.
Let him sleep.
- There he is.
- Leatherface, Leatherface.
Oh, no.
That' s not a real person.
It' s a stuntman.
OK, now, this...
This right here isn' t gonna bother him, because he' s insane, OK?
Good Lord.
- What are you watching?
- Do the dance.
A new film from the district, Safe Use of Power Tools.
Delivery.
I don' t want to know what this is, do I?
No, probably not.
Come on.
- What a finish, ladies and gentlemen.
- It was great.
What did you think of that?
- God, it was really American.
- American, yes.
It' s an American masterpiece.
Talk about gutsy endings.
The girl gets away and our hero, Leatherface, chainsaws his legs.
- Two thumbs up.
- Make that four for gore.
Listen up, I wanna read you something:
"Dear Mr. Francis Gremp, thank you for informing us
"of your problem with our Cool Dude sunglasses."
It worked.
"Please accept these Cool Dudes with our compliments."
All right, it' s Christmastime.
Free glasses.
- Are these free?
- Yes.
"We know you' il find them well- constructed
"and we hope your organization will see no need to boycott.
"Sincerely, Wayne Appleton, president, Cool Dude, Inc."
- All right, the power of the pen.
- Hey, thanks, Chainsaw.
Eakian.
Man, you think you can help me with my letter, make it sound official?
Sure, Denise.
You wanna give it to me?
OK, tonight, for homework, write a review of Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
Rhonda?
If you' re not doing anything tomorrow, I thought we could do something.
Oh, I have Lamaze class tomorrow night.
- Do you wanna go with me?
- What about Mr. Shoop?
Oh, he won' t care.
I mean, if you don' t mind being my coach.
- I wouldn' t mind at all.
- Great.
Great.
See you, Eak.
OK?
OK.
Shoop, this girl' s dyslexic.
What?
That' s not in her file.
This is serious.
You gotta get her some help.
How could she get this far with no one finding out?
She slipped through the system.
What happens when she gets out in the real world?
Wait!
Is this the same guy that took his English class to the petting zoo?
- How' d you get those kids to work?
- Bribed them.
What would it take to have dinner with you?
That would be very expensive.
- I' m having dinner with Gills.
- Big Phil again, huh?
Robin, be honest, isn' t he a bite in the ass?
No, he' s not a bite in the ass.
He happens to be very...... articulate... cultured...... extraordinarily tidy.
Tall, dark and tidy.
That' s a magic combination.
- You' re not in love.
- None of your business.
- Sure, it is.
- No.
Tell me you love him, I' il stop asking you out.
How am I gonna tell you I love him when it' s so new?
I knew it.
See, Robin, he is not the guy for you.
You need an intelligent, sensitive man who can skate.
- Do you know such a guy?
- Oh, they' re hard to find.
But now that I know, I' il keep my eye out.
Would you?
Looking good, Denise.
Good luck.
Sir, you are really gonna earn your money today.
- Francis Gremp?
- Call me Chainsaw.
- You' re up next.
- Can you hold on a sec?
Dad' s late.
He' s so irresponsible.
I said, "Dad, 3: 00 sharp." But no, it' s just in one ear, out the other.
I need your car.
- You wanna use my car?
- I' m under adult supervision.
Chainsaw, you take your test and you bring my car right back here to me.
You make me proud to be an American.
Dave, kiss this man.
You, come with me.
No, no, you stay there.
I' il bring the car to you.
Can you back this up?
I' m taking a test.
Just move all the way back.
- What?
What' d I do?
- Don' t worry about me.
See those cars on the right?
Go ahead and park in between.
What do you mean?
You mean parallel park?
- Something wrong?
- No, nothing.
Yeah.
We going on the freeway?
I think we' il just stay in the neighborhood.
Why are you driving with only one hand?
Oh, this hand' s gotta be free to put around the babes.
- Are you marking me off for that?
- Watch the dip!
Hey, you crazy?
Don' t you ever, ever yell at the driver!
Do you hear me?
- Where are you going?
The test is over.
No way!
That was your fault.
This is bullshit.
Come on.
I stayed sober for this.
You can' t do this.
Come back, you dumb dildo.
Wait, no, you' re not a dildo.
I was joking.
That was a joke.
Come on, be cool.
One more chance?
Wait.
You lost points for driving too slow and not accepting the right of way.
- Failed again.
- 70 is passing.
Seventy- two.
- I passed?
- You passed.
I passed!
Oh, I passed!
I passed!
Shoop, I passed!
I passed!
- I passed!
God, I passed!
Thanks!
- I' m proud of you.
Congratulations.
- I couldn' t have done it without you.
- Now, you drove the car.
- Look, I owe you one, all right?
- Yeah?
Yeah.
OK.
Tell you something you can do for me.
- What?
- Get help with reading.
- Man.
- Listen, Denise.
What you have is a learning disorder called dyslexia.
You need to retrain your brain to deal with information.
- There' s a specialist.
- I' m doing fine.
Yeah, you are.
But you could be doing so much better.
But that' s up to you.
Hey.
- Think about it, OK?
- OK, free film.
Free developing.
Come on, what more could you want?
Here.
Look, my dad' s a butcher.
Milk- fed.
Hi, honey, how was your day?
Hectic.
- Boy, something smells good.
- The manicotti.
Perfect timing.
Why don' t you start on the cheese and crackers.
Yeah.
It' s open.
- Hi.
- Hey.
I just brought this Ray Bradbury book.
- Maybe I should come back later.
- Why?
- Hi, Miss Bishop.
- Hi.
Oh, Robin, Pam House, one of my students.
Pam, Robin Bishop.
- Hi.
- Hi, Pam.
Freddy, I didn' t make enough for three.
If you plan on inviting company,
- I wish you' d let me know.
- No, he wasn' t.
I stopped by to help him with a lesson.
- But we can do that in the morning.
- Morning' s much better.
I' il make French toast for us.
Do you like French toast?
I bet she makes great French toast.
- I actually meant morning at school.
- Oh, fine.
- It was nice to meet you, Pam.
- You too.
Robin?
I know this is none of my business, but what the hell is going on in there?
There' s nothing going on in there.
Remember those bribes?
- Well, Pam needed a place to stay.
- How long has she been here?
A couple of days.
My laundry' s never smelled so good.
Here, take a whiff.
Oh, I' m sure it' s April fresh.
I just hope having a maid is worth the damage you could do to that young girl.
See you tomorrow.
- All ready.
- Great.
- French or Italian?
- French.
I knew it.
- Pam, we gotta talk.
What' s up?
- I think you are a great girl.
- And I think you' re a great guy.
God, this is hard.
Freddy, go ahead.
You can tell me anything.
OK.
You know how, when you' re on your board, and you see the perfect wave rolling in and you think you got it?
Only, something happens and you don' t get it.
I mean, the key to the whole thing is timing.
If you' re even a little out of sync, you' re grim, you' re blowing the barrel, you' re seaweed.
But then you look outside and you see an even more perfect wave than the first perfect wave and that' s the one you catch.
- Yeah.
Yeah, I get it.
Surfing metaphors.
- and if you want me out, just say it.
- No, no, I' m not the perfect wave.
And it' s not just that I want you out of my house.
No, you want me out of your life.
- Pam, look, I' m your teacher.
- No.
Any time one person lets themself care deeply about another person, that person runs the risk of being rejected and destroyed.
- I' il go get my things.
- No, wait.
You cooked dinner.
It looks beautiful.
Let' s sit down, eat.
It' s just food.
OK.
I' m gonna collect your book reports.
Then we are on our way to court.
Homework, Pam?
You expect me to relate to the written word after the hell you put me through?
Talk about shallow.
I' ve stepped in deeper puddles.
You' re excused.
Mr. Shoop, don' t you want mine?
Larry, you' re awake, with homework.
What' s wrong with you?
I got fired.
They found out my real age.
- Hey, I didn' t say a word.
- No, my mom came to a show.
- Your mother?
- It was a nightmare.
I mean, before she knew who I was, she put 5 bucks in my G- string.
And then my Aunt Edna, she kisses me.
With tongue.
And rips off my mask.
Mom freaked out.
She made me put on her coat.
- I' m sorry.
- You' re sorry?
I' m at my sexual peak.
Once a guy hits 18, it' s all downhill.
But it' s a lovely ride.
Mr. Shoop, why did you tell the arresting officers that the vodka found in the possession of Mr. Gremp and Mr. Frazier belonged to you?
Your Honor, to keep a couple of students out of trouble.
David and Francis have enough problems as it is.
- It' s true, Your Honor.
- Our lives are a mess.
Guys, don' t help.
Where did you young men obtain the vodka in question?
- From Murray.
- Who' s Murray?
You know Murray.
Everybody knows Murray.
From Murray' s Liquor.
Didn' t this Murray ask to see proof of age?
Well, I come off pretty mature.
- Did you show him proof of age?
- Yeah, I guess I did.
May I see it, please?
- I' d rather you didn' t.
- I' d rather I did.
You were a black Marine in 1968?
Vietnam.
A war puts a man through many, many changes.
Young man, the possession of false identification and of alcohol by a minor are serious crimes.
- I didn' t mean to.
let you off with a warning, I' il probably do the same.
- Is this guy bitchen or what?
- Now, Mr. Shoop...
Your Honor?
My name is Robin Elizabeth Bishop and I' m also on the faculty with the defendant.
I submit that this man went to jail for his students.
Very few teachers ever exhibit that degree of dedication.
Therefore, Your Honor, I move that...
Don' t move, Miss Bishop.
You' re out of order.
And you' re also correct.
Mr. Shoop, these charges will be dropped.
- Case dismissed.
- All right!
All right!
That' s so...
Shoop!
Let me tell you something.
The judge bought that dedicated teacher crap, but you covered up, thus condoning student drinking.
I am filing a report for Kelban with the entire story.
Face it.
The test scores won' t save you, because they' re losers, just like you!
Hi.
I was just congratulating our good friend Mr. Shoop.
- Now, about lunch, sweetheart.
- Tell you what, sweetheart, why don' t you go ahead, order two lunches and eat them yourself.
One for each face.
OK.
Today we take a practice test.
Pinpoint each of your weak spots.
Then we work a couple hours after school.
Wait, wait.
Practice tests, extra class time?
Not in the contract.
Eakian, get him.
The test is in two weeks.
You need the extra work.
Then I' m afraid we' re gonna need some extra incentive.
Like a party with a band.
- I could use some wheels bad.
And get me a job, man, doing strip- o- grams.
- I don' t believe this greed.
- Believe it, man.
I need a houseboy.
It' s a simple matter of renegotiating our contracts.
Renegotiate?
Who do you think you are, Teamsters?
Yeah, Teamsters!
Strike!
Strike!
Strike!
Strike!
For the past four weeks, I have given up all of my free time.
Had my body used for a tackling dummy, my house trashed, my couch set on fire, my goldfish murdered, my butt thrown in jail and my car wrecked.
All I' m asking for is a little extra effort.
You know, what' s sad is you guys could all pass that test.
But you' re just so happy being failures that you just don' t know...
Why am I doing this?
Tell you what.
I' m going to Hawaii and be tan.
Have a cow.
Damn.
Hey.
Thanks for the help.
Good luck.
- Where are you going?
- To quit.
- You can' t quit.
- Sure, I can.
- I never got through to anybody.
They were learning.
- You' re not a quitter.
- I am.
- and you haven' t quit bugging me.
- Wanna go out to dinner tonight?
- Can' t.
- See?
Everybody take a seat.
You, in the cot, out of bed.
- Where' s Mr. Shoop?
- He has tendered his resignation.
Now, sit down.
Would someone tell me what Mr. Shoop had planned for today?
- Yes?
- Group sex.
No, that' s tomorrow.
Today' s independent study, right after our midmorning nap.
Don' t think you can pull this BS with me.
Everybody take their textbooks out and turn to chapter seven.
Read it again.
Who' s making that noise?
What noise?
I don' t hear any noise.
What, you got dog ears?
- Chainsaw, stop doing that.
- Stop doing what?
You know, I hear it too and it' s annoying.
Find the hooligan that' s responsible, because I am trying to read chapter seven.
Again.
Mr. Gills, I cannot study.
I' m going to the library.
Chainsaw, sit down.
You can hum till your lips fall off, I could care less.
Wait a minute.
You' re not dismissed.
- and you will be sorry.
- We will be sorry?
Mr. Gills sure does know his child psychology.
Miss Cura, I want to let you know that the children are a little hyperactive, but I' m sure that you' il enjoy their joie de vivre.
So far, I' ve only subbed at grammar schools, so this should be a nice change.
Help, Mr. Gills!
Denise!
Denise!
Take it easy!
What happened?
Don' t go in there without a gun.
It' s terrible.
- Is this my classroom?
- Yes, it is.
Whose blood is that?
Is that your blood?
No.
My God.
We' re back!
What is wrong with you people?
It' s like you said, Gills!
We' re psychopaths!
Somebody better call the school nurse!
I am not amused!
Turn off those motors!
Now!
I' m not ready for high school.
- Why' d she leave?
Didn' t she like us?
- Where' s her sense of humor?
This is...
- Devilishly clever.
- Vomitous!
- Thank you.
- We take a lot of pride in our work.
Look, we want Shoop back.
Why would Shoop come back?
So Kelban can fire him?
He might surprise you.
- We did today.
- And we' ve got more for tomorrow.
Do we have a deal?
Wondermutt, I do not want to play.
I' m busy.
- Tough day?
- We' ve been torturing Gills.
Yeah.
He said you could have your job back.
Now, why would I want my job back?
Hey, my life is sailing.
I got a radio, blanket, beach chair, dark glasses, dog.
Why would I wanna go back?
How about we can' t pass that test without you?
Me and Chainsaw, we been sober for two days, four hours and 15 minutes.
- No kidding?
Reality is so unreal.
- Truly.
Thumbs up.
I think you should know that you were a phase.
I' ve outgrown you.
But I do wanna be friends, if you can handle it.
And Shoop...... I' m seeing that reading specialist this afternoon.
But we need a teacher.
What do you say, Mr. Shoop?
Please?
How can I say no to these cute little faces?
Your practice test scores were great.
Hey, come on, you been here 12 hours.
I want you to go home, forget about this test, get a good night' s sleep.
I' il see you tomorrow, 8 AM, the lecture hall.
Hey, trust me.
Come on, you' re gonna kick ass and take names.
Believe it.
- Are we really that ready?
- Ready?
What time' s the test?
- Eight AM.
- See, the correct answers do not stop.
Now, go on, get out of here, all of you, before the college recruiters show up and try to drag you all off to Harvard.
Hey, I mean it.
Wondermutt, look.
I found Bob.
Go get it.
Yeah!
- Morning, Mom.
- Morning, sweetheart.
Morning, Dad.
How do you want your eggs, honey?
Fried, scrambled?
I don' t know.
- What are eggs?
- I' il surprise you.
How do you spell "cat"?
- I don' t know!
- Honey, what' s wrong?
I don' t know what' s wrong.
Everything' s blank.
I don' t know anything.
I don' t know anything!
I don' t know anything!
Chainsaw!
Chainsaw!
Chainsaw!
Are you all right?
- I had a nightmare.
- About what?
I don' t know.
- Great day for a test, huh?
- Yeah.
Hey, Shoop.
- An apple.
- For the teacher.
Give them hell.
- Hey, we' re testing in here.
- I know, I' m in your class.
I remember you.
Where you been?
Bathroom.
- Six weeks?
- My zipper got stuck.
"Do not open the test booklets until you are told to do so.
"Using a number two pencil, take your answer sheet and fill in your name.
"Last name first, first name second, middle initial last on the first line.
"Do this now."
This officer is here to see that there is no cheating.
This officer is here to see that there is no cheating.
Festival of screwups and their king.
Mr. Gills extends his warmest personal regards and best wishes.
Hey, thanks for caring, man.
OK.
Break the seals on your test booklets now.
And turn to the section titled Reading Vocabulary.
"You will have 20 minutes to complete this section."
Everybody ready?
No!
Tension breaker, had to be done.
Anybody else?
Good luck, gang.
Ready.
Begin.
Sorry.
Kevin.
It' s starting.
Now?
Shit.
How far apart?
Twelve minutes.
Try and slow it down.
Forget about the...
- Thirty seconds left.
- Come on, come on.
C, C,
C, C, C,
C, C, C, C.
- And...
- Wait 20 more seconds.
- Twenty seconds.... stop.
Pencils down.
C, C, C.
Drop them!
Stay seated until Anna- Maria picks up your tests.
Miss Mazarelli, may I have those tests after you collect them, please?
- Yeah.
- Can Rhonda and I be excused?
She' s having a baby.
- She' s having a baby?
- Oh, I wanna see this.
Calm down!
Everybody just stay in your seats.
No problem here at all.
Rhonda, why didn' t you say something?
- I wanted to finish my test.
- You need hot water, a ride?
- All we need is a hospital.
- What can I do?
- Get out of my way.
- I can do that.
Carmine, get out of her way!
Get the door.
- Save the umbilical cord.
- And the afterbirth, if convenient.
Good thinking.
Oh, easy, easy, this way.
Watch out.
- You look terrific.
- Well, I' m feeling pretty good.
That' s great.
The baby is healthy and happy.
And my coach was incredible.
Yeah, well, I couldn' t have done it without you.
No cord, huh?
When do we get to see the whippersnapper?
Rhonda, don' t let those two near the baby, please.
Well, it won' t be a problem.
I' m giving her up for adoption.
- She' s going to a really good home.
- That' s nice.
I' m not ready to be a mom.
- Mr. Shoop.
- Ciao.
Ciao, gang.
How' s it going?
- All right.
- OK.
Bad news?
Gills says he' s mailing you your scores.
- We failed.
- He just said the average grade
- So we failed.
Hey, you didn' t fail.
I failed.
Field trips to the beach, a bed in your classroom, drinking at the beach, a screening of Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1.
- Quite a summer, Mr. Shoop.
- I tried to keep it interesting.
I have his dismissal ready for your signature, sir.
I understand there are some people waiting to speak in Mr. Shoop' s behalf.
- Really?
- Come in.
Mr. Kelban, you' re not actually going to listen to these delinquents?
I' m gonna listen to their parents.
I' m Principal Kelban.
- Is there a spokesperson here?
- I guess I am.
I' m Howard Gremp.
You' re Chainsaw' s father.
- Interesting boy.
He' s a lunatic.
Dad.
You know, six weeks ago, I thought he had the IQ of a salad bar.
His only interest in life was to make people sick.
If my mother came to dinner, he would give the dog a third eye or an extra leg.
Because of him, we stopped having kids.
I mean, you can imagine the feeling when I saw him studying.
The wife and I almost burst into tears.
- David was doing his homework too.
- It makes sense, they share the same brain.
Not only did Mr. Shoop get my daughter to read, he taught her to drive.
He showed Kevin there' s more to life than just football.
- I' m not sure I agree, but it' s possible.
- This man should not be teaching.
Proof is here in these test results.
Look for yourself, Mr. Shoop.
Passing is 70.
Average score here was 63.
- They failed.
- That is not true, Mr. Gills.
- We passed?
- No, not all of you.
But that' s not what' s important here.
Larry.
Went from an 18 to a 51!
You!
- Mom, my hair.
- Rhonda.
From a 29 to a 43 and she gave birth.
Isn' t childbirth grounds for a makeup test?
It always has been.
This woman thing never fails.
Eakian.
A 51 to a 74.
I passed!
I am an Eakian, Grams.
- All right, Eaker.
- Denise.
No previous test score because you ditched every test, but a 38.
- Honey, that' s terrific.
- We' il get them next time.
- Kevin.
- Yeah?
From a 48 to a 75!
Yeah!
I' m back on the team!
- Yeah!
Kill!
- Yeah!
Kill!
Chainsaw.
Last score was a 6.
This time, 59.
Monster comeback.
- All right.
- And Dave.
From a 26 to a 70.
I passed!
- You made it!
- You passed?
You passed and I failed, asshole!
How could you do that to me?
It was an accident.
I can fail, I know it.
And Pam went from a 53 to an 82.
- Was that the highest?
- Well, almost.
I mean, that guy who spent six weeks in the bathroom got a 91.
But look, there' s more going on here than test scores and grades.
You all worked hard and you improved.
And that' s very nice, Mr. Shoop.
We are here to discuss his flagrant violation of school policies.
Hold it, Gills.
According to my numbers, the average scores here increased from 28 to 63.
That' s 125 percent improvement.
Now, that' s teaching.
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.
Mr. Shoop, I' m granting you tenure.
He' s back, ladies and gentlemen!
I promise.
Will you have dinner with me?
I' il think about it.
Can I use some of that lip stuff?
Does this mean we can have dinner tonight?
I didn' t say that.
We' il just talk about it over breakfast. >> Napisy pobrane z http: // napisy. org << >>>>>>>> nowa wizja napisów <<<<<<<<
- [Cheering Continues]
And so we are halfway through the sixth round of this heavyweight title fight... and on my unofficial count, I got the champ ahead.
Why wouldn' t you have?
He' s getting a one- way beating.
It' s called the {y: i} "sweet science," this sport of boxing... {y: i} and it is a carnival {y: i} of carnage.
This is the vineyard of the "fistic" arts... and the grapes of pugilism are being stomped into a Chateauneuf- du- pulp tonight.
{y: i} - [Woman]
- Um, an arena ve- ve- very --
Hard Copy, why don' t you move your fuckin 'crew outta the way?
You' re fuckin 'up my view.
And -- And the groundlings, very much aroused...
- Get outta the way! - as they should be, for this is not a boxing arena.
It' s the Globe Theatre.
It' s the Old Vic.
{y: i} These people aren' t really {y: i} watching a heavyweight fight.
They' re watching King Lear.
Hey, hey, motherfucker, are you deaf?
I didn' t pay $1, 500 for both these seats... and flatten them watchamajiggem up here to see no King Lear.
- What the fuck is wrong?
- My brother, I' m a man of peace.
"Why do you box?"
- I can' t let no white motherfucker call me "brother."
- "I' m not a poet."
Here we go.
- Here we go.
Where you at?
Where you at?
There' s three of you and one of me, and you' re running like roaches when the lights come on!
Punch or get out!
Hit him!
Hit him!
- [Grunting Continues]
- Three, four, five...
Roper!
- [Bell Dings]
The Lord God Jehovah is a mighty god!
- Am I right?
- A mighty god.
Champ.
Champ.
You' re a beautiful human being.
Come on over, baby.
Freddie wants to talk to you.
Congratulations, champ.
Was that as easy a fight as it looked?
Of course it was easy.
I' m the greatest fighter in the world.
Even in China.
Nobody can beat me.
You know, you got a little attitude there.
Are you mad at something?
I' m a little upset with myself, because I had a image of this guy falling on a right hand.
But I hit him with the left, and I hit him so hard that his jaw kind of shattered.
- When I came back with the right. he was already on the ground.
- Glory be to God!
All praises due Allah!
God bless America.
This is a great champion and a great man.
If I can have the fighter back a minute here, Reverend.
You' re saying it makes a difference to you how he falls?
Oh, definitely.
I' m a artist out there, and- and, you know... it' s like I painted a beautiful picture of the Mona Lisa and forgot to put the breast on.
That' s beccause the champ is an artist, and he' s the greatest showman on the planet.
And the greatest fighter.
No man can beat this man at this point in his life.
And I want you to know, Marvin Shabazz, wherever you are... you better watch the things you' re sayin ',' cause we hear 'em.
{y: i} - Reverend --
- to go along with the rest of the heads he already has.
- Let me borrow the fighter --
We' re callin 'the taxidermist right now for the fighter that he just laid out.
- Let me get the fighter back.
Did this guy hurt you at all?
- Not at all.
- He hit me one time just to wake me up, because I was bored.
- Bored?
That' s right.
Otherwise, it was just like fightin 'my little sister.
Okay, ladies and gentlemen of the press... {y: i} I' m now proud {y: i} to present to you... the undisputed... and still undefeated... heavyweight champion of the world...
James "The Grim Reaper" Roper!
Move, move, move!
- Shut up!
- Shut the fuck up!
{y: i} Sit down.
{y: i} It' s a pressconference.
- I want to say all praise to Allah.
Allah Akbah, champ.
Send some love out to my dear and a special shout- out to the Reverend Sultan here.
{y: i} 'Cause without him, {y: i} I wouldn' t even be around.
Who do you plan to fight next?
Uh, well, that' s the reverend' s job.
I just knock 'em out.
I' m the number- one contender, and I' m tired of you duckin 'me.
- Get outta the way!
- Hey, we ain' t duckin 'you, man.
- You' re just so black, we can' t fight you.
- Fuck you!
- Marvin Shabazz, you' re a great fighter... and you will get your title shot.
Oh- Oh- Oh, no, no, no, no.
See, what we want is, is a guarantee.
{y: i} Yeah, that' s right, that my man, {y: i} Marvin Shabazz Flex O' Neil -- {y: i} Marvin, will you?
{y: i} Boy, that boy' s good, ain' t he?
{y: i} And I' m sayin '{y: i} that everybody knows he' s good.
We' re just asking the reverend to give us a shot at the title.
Stop running like a B- I -- itch.
- "B- I- itch"?
- It' s "be- otch."
- Where the fuck you from?
- Listen, tar baby... why don' t you go get some Ambi, brighten your ass up and stop lookin 'like a oil spill... {y: i} and then we can talk business.
- I' il tell you what, honk.
- That old corny shit.
I' il stick my dick so far your fuckin 'ass, I' il impale your tonsils.
- Oh, that' s a pretty picture!
- Shut up!
- All right.
{y: i} - Fake- ass black man.
- Is this what you want?
- That' s exactly what I want.
- I' il spank you with it.
- Spank him, champ!
- I' il spank you.
Come here!
- Spank me with it, motherfucker!
You ain' t earned it!
{y: i} You wanna drive another {y: i} I' m the champ, motherfucker.
{y: i} Till you beat me, I am the champ.
Thanks, Sultan.
- [Positive Responses]
Hey!
Everybody enjoy yourself, all right?
How was the house, Peter?
But we gave away 4, 000 seats to charity.
Fred, we keep puttin 'on fights like this, I' m gonna have to sell the fuckin' hotel.
Do you have the pay- per- view pickup, Artemus?
- I understand that, but I' m the one -- - Artemus!
Yes.
- Bad news.
{y: i} - How bad?
Pay- per- view was down 50% from the last heavyweight title fight.
- Yeah, we lost our ass.
Well, I just un- guaranteed it.
Buy him two.
He' s got six already.
Well, now he' s got eight!
- Here he is.
{y: i} - Showtime, folks, {y: i} [Roper]
{y: i} Who' s in the house?
The heavywight champion of the world!
What' s up, babe?
- I love you.
- Not like I love you.
- No, I love you.
- I love you.
- You' re my brother.
- Ow!
I love you.
That' s the third "I love you"
- Am I gettin 'jerked again?
- You' re my brother.
- I know I' m your brother, but am I gettin 'fucked again?
- I love you.
Artemus, am I gettin 'jerked?
He' s your brother.
Sol?
- He loves you.
- I love you.
- Yo, forget this this, man.
Champ, champ.
No, no, Reverend.
This is the payday, man.
This is the day we' ve been waitin 'for.
- You' re my brother.
- I got your brother hangin 'low.
Now, I done had 38 fights for you, and I won 'em all.
What I got to show for it?
- Six Rolls- Royces?
You got eight.
No, I got a guaranteed contact for $10 million.
I' il sue your ass.
- Sue his ass, champ.
- Sue him.
- For everything.
- Sue me.
- Sue him.
- Sue him.
I love you.
Yo, this is bullshit, man.
Stop saying that!
Yo, Irv!
- I' il be back.
[Grunts]
- Ohh!
- Wardell.
Yes, sir.. Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Can you forgive me as I forgive you?
What am I forgivin 'you for now, man?
For bein 'human.
For bein 'flawed.
I bleed.
{y: i} - [Jeering]
- No, Fred. / hurt. / bleed.
And I want my goddamn money!
Now!
Sweetheart, could you --
Sit.
There better be some money up underneath this couch.
{y: i} All right, everybody, {y: i} you heard him.
The champ wants his money.
That' s what he said.
Yes, sir..
Artemus, we will pay the champ what we' re obligated to pay him.
{y: i} Sell these rings.
Fire the employees.
And we' il settle with the champ for what?
Fifteen cents on the dollar..
Do it.
Champ, you would let this man... the only father figure you' ve ever had, destroy himself for you?
You bet your yarmulke.
- Well, consider it done.
No.
{y: i} Fred, please, now.
{y: i} You' re just a little upset.
Of course I' m upset.
I' m upset... {y: i} because I know what' s wrong.
{y: i} Peter, do you know what' s wrong?
- No.
- Artemus?
- No.
- Sol?
- No.
- How about you, champ?
I don' t know nothin 'anymore.
There' s a reason everyone has lost interest... in the heavyweight championship of the world.
And it' s very simple.
People are tired of payin 'good money... to watch niggers beat up niggers.
- Come on.
A white heavyweight?
{y: i} Man, the two words {y: i} don' t even go together..
- [Laughing]
Hey, look, man, cut the bullshit.
I want Shabazz.
You work for me!
{y: i} [People Gasping]
And if you do shut up, and you do work for me... you' il make more money than you' ve ever dreamed of.
You' il make $40 million.
If I' m makin '40, think how much you gonna make.
- I am!
- Hey, look, Rev... nobody gonna buy the idea of a white contender.
It ain' t about race It' s about boxing.
- Sit down.
- I just stood up.
- Sit down.
What' s the highest grossing fight in the history of boxing?
- Uh, Tyson- Gibbons.
- Ali- Frazier.
- Hagler- Leonard.
- No, Hagler- Hearns.
- "Thrilla" in Manila.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
The highest grossing fight in the history of boxing --
Is Cooney versus Holmes.
{y: i} Can you tell me why, James?
'Cause Cooney was a white boy.
And his jab couldn' t break wind!
- That' s true.
If there ain' t a white guy out there for you...
I' m gonna create you one.
{y: i} Fred Sultan... {y: i} you and I are gonna take a close {y: i} look at this boxing promoter...
And by the time our journey is over, gentle viewer...
I' m gonna expose him for what he really is: the devil incarnate.
{y: i} was arrested {y: i} and convicted for assault.
{y: i} He nearly stomped a man {y: i} to death very brutally --
Don' t -- What army is this?
All right, all right.
Enough.
Not again.
Get this on camera.
{y: i} Don' t touch him again!
Rolling.
{y: i} [Kane]
{y: i} I' ve got here Marvin Shabazz... the man next in line to fight James Roper.
That' s how it should be, but I got a bad feeling about this one, Mitchell.
{y: i} Yeah, and if Sultan doesn' t {y: i} give us a shot at the title... and he tries to duck us, then we will sue him.
{y: i} And I will support these men.
I' il take it.
- These are honorable men.
Very -- Yes.
- No, we are honorable men.
We' ve worked too hard for this.
Now, I am the number- one contender.
I' m tired of James "The Poodle," "Grim Reaper," whatever he want to calls himself... duckin 'me, all right?
I' m tired of the man drivin 'around in eight Rolls- Royces.
- He ain' t fought nobody.
{y: i} - Exactly.
That -- A what?
Uh, a- a Brougham.
He- He drives a Brougham.
What' s a Brougham?
It' s maroon.
{y: i} Well, actually it' s not maroon.
{y: i} What it is -- It' s merlot.
- And it' s a Brougham.
{y: i} - Cut.
Did we cut?
- Yeah.
- What' s a merlot Brougham?
- It' s like an old car, right?
- You guys don' t know what a merlot Brougham is?
- I thought it was a breakfast cereal.
- I thought so too.
{y: i} I' m sorry.
We got -- - It' s a Cadillac.
- A "Brom."
- "Brough- ham."
- A Brougham.
- Brougham, not "Brom."
- I got it.
A Brougham.
- Rolling.
{y: i} [Woman]
And again.
Action.
The merlot Brougham.
It' s a -- It' s a fine car, but nothing like a Rolls- Royce.
And you guys are plenty peeved.
{y: i} - Yeah.
- I don' t care about the cars.
That' s all.
{y: i} - Exactly.
Like my daddy say, you out there, James "The Poodle." "Pussy," whatever your name is... if you a man, be a man.
Fight me.
You ain' t fought nobody.
Your daddy said... what?
Is he talking about --
- He' s talking about the poodle or the -- - No, no, no, no, no.
You become a man.
{y: i} You wanna start actin '{y: i} like a man, then you be a man,
Just like my father had told me that... when the green grass starts growin 'on the other side, then somebody gotta cut the lawn.
{y: i} You know, my father said once, {y: i} "When you -- When you, uh...
"laugh and the whole world laughs with you.
Cry, and I' il give you something to cry about, you little bastard. "
That what he said.
And you know what that' s done to me?
{y: i} I- I' m not -- {y: i} I' m not for sure
You' re a little camera shy, aren' t you?
Yeah.
This the guy {y: i} at the top of your list, Julio?
{y: i} He' s on the top of my punchin 'bag list.
Fuck.
There he goes.
That' s my new assistant.
I could intoduce you.
- Julio, come on.
- Looks like two moons over Miami.
Let' s go.
Yeah, I like this guy.
{y: i} Kind of squeaky clean... shit- don' t- stink, Mouseketeer- lookin 'motherfucker..
Yeah, Pat Boone in boxing gloves.
You know, {y: i} John Wayne is his uncle.
Don' t look like John Wayne now.
- Next.
{y: i} Come on, get the next one on.
{y: i} [Peter]
{y: i} Look at his hair!
{y: i} - [Sultan]
Kind of swarthy, mysterious, strong- jawed, sexy.
- Women might like him.
- Oh, they' il eat it up.
{y: i} "Suave Bola" guy.
{y: i} Next.
{y: i} Championship in South Africa -- {y: i} [Sultan]
{y: i} South Africa, Julio?
South Africa?
{y: i} - Where' d he go?
Good for you.
Oh, I felt that.
Oh, Dolph Lundren.
I like this guy.
- I was at this fight.
It was two months ago.
- Yeah?
What happened?
Watch.
Rocky Vl.
{y: i} The guy had to have his jaw rewired.
{y: i} [Laughing]
Thank you {y: i} very much.
My God.
You know, it' s a shame... political power in this country' s not determined in a boxing ring.
If it was, we' d learn how to fight.
- [Laughing]
I told you --
You told me shit, Julio.
Ahem!
I have an idea.
{y: i} Hey, shut the fuck up {y: i} and run the tapes, huh?
Oh, you gonna clown me?
You can run this shit yourself.
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
He apologizes.
{y: i} Speak, please.
Come on.
{y: i} I was simply trying to say the champ, {y: i} he' s never lost as a proffessional, right?
- What gave it away?
His record?
But... he' s lost as an amateur, right?
- So what?
He was B. F. D.
So... who beat him?
He was an amateur..
{y: i} - Amateurs don' t count.
{y: i} Are you high?
{y: i} Are you on something?
Hey, hey, hey, shut the fuck up.
Don' t you realize what she' s saying?
{y: i} Ten years ago, who beat {y: i} Roper as an amateur?
{y: i} - [All Laughing]
Uh, who?
Terry Conklin.
Sweeheart, you are smarter than all these clowns put together.
- Terry who?
- You work for me now.
She works for me.
Uh, Julio, she works for me.
Okay, fine.
You got her.
{y: i} Welcome to the club, {y: i} sweetheart.
Well, you can check this "sweetheart" shit at the door.
{y: i} - She works for you now.
- Excuse me, Ms Bambi.
And you get a 10% raise.
- Now, where were we?
- Terry Conklin.
- Terry Conklin.
{y: i} Golden Gloves champion.
Good left hook.
Great overhand right.
Discovered God or drugs or pussy or some such shit.
- Man, look at how they livin '!
Get down.
Since Marciano for inner- fucking- peace.
- Geez, what a dumb fuck he was.
- Unbelievable!
Now, you wanna find his Brady Bunch ass?
- I' il call Bert Sugar.
- You ain' t fuckin 'me no more!
- Disperse, bitches, will you?
{y: i} Marvin, Marvin, chill.
- Yeah.
Yeah, that' s what it' s about.
And the next thing you know... we got guns on you, and what you got, huh?
- You got a -- a whole, uh -- whole bunch og guns with- with lasers on 'em.
{y: i} [Sniffs]
But I mean, you know, does violence really solve anything?
{y: i} I mean, we just came over {y: i} because you haven' t answered {y: i} our calls or anything like that.
We thought that, you know, maybe something was wrong with you.
[Nervous Chuckling]
{y: i} And, uh, you haven' t offered us {y: i} a shot at the title.
And it' s just a rumour, but people are talkin 'about you tryin' to duck my man.
- And that' s, you know -- - Marvin, I' m giving you the title shot.
{y: i} As a matter of fact, we were {y: i} just discussing the details.
{y: i} Yeah, there' s some {y: i} legal bull -- Hello.
There' s some legal bullshit we have to work out before we can make you an offer.
We- We' re -- Yeah, we' re just trying to get all of our ducks in a row.
It' s a duck thing.
Duck thing.
So you are giving us a shot at the title?
You have my word.
Excuse me, Reverend, but your word don' t mean shit, all right?
Yeah, I mean, your word is rather doo... doo.
{y: i} Uh, but we- we' re lookin '{y: i} for something tangible.
No, fuck tangible.
Give me something real.
{y: i} That' s what I want.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Just, you know, whoo, calm down.
We -- You know, we' re gonna get everything together.
Like I said, we come in peace.
{y: i} You know, we' re small- time.
I' d like to give you something as a sign of good faith while I get my ducks in a row.
- Fuck is all this duckshit -- - [Screams]
{y: i} - Chill with all these ducks.
- Shut up, you woman.
We tryin 'to, you know, negotiate.
Let me do business.
{y: i} Are you still driving {y: i} that, um, maroon Brougham?
Yeah.
I don' t mean to correct you in front of your people, but it' s merlot.
Merlot.
- Yeah.
Well, I' d like to give you a brand- new merlot Brougham, as a sign of good faith.
{y: i} Because you' re my brother {y: i} and I love you.
Cool, cool.
That' s -- Hey, that sounds, you know --
No, I- I- I' m tired of merlot.
That' s right, I' m tired.
I can' t stand another merlot.
Well, baby, you know, there' s this sweet gold --
Oh, kind of a muscatel.
Hey, That' s fine.
Muscatel.
{y: i} - Artemus?
{y: i} - Yeah.
Order a brand- new muscatel.
Royal Brougham... fully loaded with, um, a petite Syrah interior...
- [Chuckling]
Thanks, man.
I -- You know -- Boy, that' s -- You know, that really means a lot.
{y: i} I would take it that {y: i} a fully loaded... muscatel Brougham with the serials and petite and everything like that... is a good faith down payment on a title fight.
My brothers.
Hey, Man, I' m glad we could, you know, straighten this out.
Man, this -- Is this rayon?
{y: i} This is nice.
Whole thing {y: i} got my blood pressure up, man.
- [Thank you.
Come and hug the man.
- Mm- hmm.
We' re about to be champs, baby.
{y: i} My daddy said, {y: i} "Don' t pull your shit out if you {y: i} ain' t ready to use it," you know?
- Shut up!
- Bitch!
I gotta change.
{y: i} Sultan, I got him.
Terry Conklin {y: i} is still livin 'in Cleveland.
{y: i} He' s in a band {y: i} called Massive Head Wound.
Yeah, {y: i} I' m bookin 'the flight now.
- This guy' s a putz!
- No, he' s got something.
You like him, Bambi?
- I think he' s gorgeous.
- Say what?
- For a white boy.
- Thank you.
I think we found our man!
{y: i} Terry.
Terry, {y: i} this is Suzette.
Wonderful music, Terry.
Wonderful.
I feel that, uh, you' re my brother.
I' m your anti- brother.
[Laughs]
[Chuckles]
{y: i} You know, actually, {y: i} you' re a poet.
Well, an anti- poet.
{y: i} Terry.
Hit the bricks.
{y: i} You know, it -- {y: i} it feels like... oh, like anti- music.
{y: i} Terry.
This is Angel.
Cool.
{y: i} I worship you.
Worship is a Judeo- Christian concept.
I' m a Buddhist.
No shit.
Incoming.
- Uh, Terry.
{y: i} [Sultan]
May I call you Terry?
What you call me is of no concern to me.
'Cause I' m gonna call {y: i} your ass "The Great White Hope."
{y: i} Excuse me.
I' m trying to make you a business proposition here.
- I give my money to the homeless.
{y: i} - Good.
I guarantee that you will personally wipe out homelessness in America.
- What did you say?
- I want you to return to the ring.
I don' t fight anymore.
But you' re the only man to ever beat the current heavyweight champion.
- Very long time ago.
- You can still kick his ass!
{y: i} He' s still susceptible {y: i} to an overhand right.
I did cold- cock that sucker, didn' t I?
{y: i} Oh, you nailed him!
{y: i} You rocked his ass!
{y: i} Think about it.
This could be {y: i} the fight of the century.
- The fight of the century.
You.
Until the next fight of the century, right?
- Get the fuck outta my chair.
You' re a shrewd man.
Well, if not for yourself, Terry, do it for the tired, the poor... the teeming masses yearning to breathe free.
How much I get?
Ten million dollars.
{y: i} And hire you the best managers {y: i} and trainers in the business.
Ten million dollars?
You really think I could take him?
He' s scared shitless of you,
And think of the homeless.
{y: i} - Well!
- Well.
{y: i} You found Terry Conklin, huh?
- Yep.
{y: i} - Congratulations.
Now I want the W. B. I. to rank him in the top 10 so I can give him a titleshot.
I have bent and greased and stretched the rules for you.
As a matter of fact, I consider myself something of an artist in this regard.
- You are an artist, Julio.
- Yes, but even I... cannot rank a fighter who has never had a proffessional fight.
Now, what' s it gonna take for you to make this happen?
- I can' t do it.
{y: i} - Money?
{y: i} - No.
Drugs?
Power?
[Chuckles]
That' s what I -- Yeah, power.
- [Laughing]
Pow -- - Yeah.
You' re fired.
Okay.
Money, sex and drugs.
Ladies and gentlemen, {y: i} I am proud to announce... {y: i} that 60 days from today... on March 17, St. Patrick' s Day...
James "The Grim Reaper" Roper... will defend his heavyweight title... against the number- eight- ranked heavyweight contender... according to the newly released W. B. I. ranking.
{y: i} "Irish" Terry Conklin!
- I' m not Irish.
- There he is.
There he is.
"Irish" Terry Conklin.
This is a goddamn disgrace.
This kid can' t fight.
You' ve sullied the great name of boxing.
Oh, ye of little faith.
{y: i} This man has been catapulted {y: i} into the rankings... by the honorable, estimable, incorruptible president... {y: i} of World Boxing International... {y: i} Mr.. Julio Escobar..
- And for very good reason.
- Name one.
Well, you forget that this man...
- was an undefeated amateur...
- That' s right. who knocked out James Roper in the Goleden Gloves Championship.
- Knocked him through the ropes!
I' d kill Howdy Doody now!
Nigga, sit your motherfuckin 'ass down.
I' m tryin '-- [Muttering]
I think Terry has a few words he wants to say to you.
{y: i} [Light Applause]
Uh, well, I would just like to start off by sayin 'thank you to the champ... {y: i} for giving me this chance to --
You' re a -- You' re a great champ.
Uh, and after I' m done kickin 'the champ' s butt... {y: i} I' m gonna donate all my monies to {y: i} eradicating the homelessness situations.
And also the poverty situations will be eradicated... {y: i} in America, as well {y: i} as the United States forever.
Thank you very much, and God bless you all.
- Got my vote for Sportsman of the year already.
- Terry, Terry, Terry, who bought this?
{y: i} Who is that?
{y: i} Who is he?
And who do you think' s gonna see the debacle?
This' il is the biggest payday in sports history, much less boxing.
For Christ' s sake, Sultan, the kid' s not even a professional.
Bert, the kid' s not even a hundred percent Irish.
But how many of you gave Foreman a chance against Moore?
Or Buster Douglas against Tyson?
Julo Escobar' s a whore on your payroll.
What did you say?
- Keep it legal.
- Did you hear that?
- That' s right.
{y: i} Are you saying something {y: i} about brown- skinned people?
Do you hate Jews and Negroes as well?
- I am a Jew.
- The you' re an Uncle Tom!
Jews can' t be Uncle Toms.
Sure we can.
{y: i} But you' re still my brother.
- [Scoffs]
{y: i} - [Men Shouting]
{y: i} Let' s get out of here.
- [Grunts]
Terry, this is the legendary Johnny Windsor.
- He' s managed many, many of the greats.
- Very pleased to meet you.
Terry, eight weeks with me... and you' re not only gonna be a lean, mean killing machine... you' re gonna be ready for a commission in the Waffen- SS.
- Wha -- - Hate, son!
Hate!
The great motivator.
{y: i} You' re gonna hate me.
I hate no man.
Well, do it... for the homeless, Terry
Get changed.
We' il start.
{y: i} - [Bell Buzzing]
Look, all you gotta do is make him credible.
I can make him credible, till he gets in the ring.
- When the bell rings, he' s dogmeat.
- Dogmeat.
Time and Newsweek say I should be arrested.
{y: i} Sports illustrated says the fight' s a joke.
Ring magazine says the fight is a fraud?
Why are they sayin 'these things?
'Cause it' s the truth.
The truth needs to be shaped and molded and framed, Sol.
Your fucking job!
I cannot make caviar out of fisheggs!
- I can' t commit homicide, but I might!
- Uh, excuse me, uh, Fred.
Listen, we -- Hi, Sol.
Tough day for you, huh?
{y: i} We need to get these contracts {y: i} to Conklin for his signature {y: i} before he gets a good lawyer.
- I' il hire Conklin' s lawyer.
- All right.
How are the contracts?
I had 'em reviewed by my entire staff.
{y: i} Nobody understands anything.
- Good.
{y: i} I think it' s our finest work.
{y: i} These contracts are vague, indecipherable {y: i} and best of all, they' re written in stone.
I- I love you.
- Don' t you start that.
Excuse me, Reverend, but I opened this on accident.
It' s yours.
But I think you might want to take a look at it.
- What is this?
- I don' t know.
{y: i} Where' d it come from?
{y: i} Mitchell Kane.
- He says he has a lot more of them.
- A lot more?
What' s he want?
He says he wants a private meeting.
No cameras, no third parties.
Just a "mano a mano" is how he put it.
"Mano a mano"?
My dick wants to laugh.
- What is it?
- Pictures of nothing, Sol.
You know what?
I don' t need this shit.
I' il be at the pool.
{y: i} I' il finish up these, uh, {y: i} these contracts for you.
Arrange a private meeting with Mr. Kane.
Yes, sir.
Action.
Although our cameras aren' t allowed inside the offices of Rev. Fred Sultan... {y: i} let them record, in the happenchance {y: i} that I don' t come out alive... that this envelope contains enough evidence to destroy this man forever.
When I return, if I return... the spotlight of truth will have peered into the depths of evil... into the soul, if one exists... of one Fred Sultan.
Kill the camera.
Cut.
I' il be okay.
It' s okay.
I' m proud of you,
We' il be here.
{y: i} Mr.. Kane!
Here we are.
[Laughing]
That' s right.
Uh --
Uh, Wardell.
Oh.
Um, I' ve made many copies of these
So what do you want?
I want to destroy you,
{y: i} And I want {y: i} an exclusive interview... {y: i} where you' re gonna have to finally {y: i} answer some of the tough questions.
You' re bad.
{y: i} Even Wardell' s disgusted, you know, {y: i} but I' m not gonna kiss your feet.
You' re a bully.
{y: i} I don' t like what you do to Girl Scouts.
{y: i} That was pretty funny, huh?
- I like you.
You have a goal, and you have the balls to reach that goal.
{y: i} You have a blind, stupid belief in yourself.
My course is --
No, no, no.
I wanna offer you a job.
I heard they' re gonna do Cops:
The Musical.
That could be kind of unreal.
Well, they did it with --
- [Sighs]
- Never more lucid.
Turn on the camera.
Thank you, Artie.
Some said this upcoming title fight is built around racism.
{y: i} But is it racism {y: i} that electrifies people... {y: i} across the globe?
Or is it a pride in your tribe?
{y: i} Dimly remembered throb {y: i} of drums in the night... {y: i} or the hard, white hoarfrost {y: i} of an early morn... against the gleaming, sinuous muscle of the jungle night.
You can' t do this to me!
I' ve been the Sultan' s publicist for 20 years!
Boss says you' re gone, your ass is outta here.
I am gonna sue you so fast, you won' t know what the hell hit you!
- Man, shut up!
- Hey, {y: i} - I got you guys this job.
- He' s right.
You better watch your back!
Mitchell, have you sold out?
Uh, I' m taking the road less traveled by.
And what happened to, um, crusading for the truth?
What is the truth, after all?
History, they say, is written by the winners.
Fuck you, you whore.
{y: i} - Vivian -- - I quit.
{y: i} Oh, Viv- Vivian, {y: i} we can win a Pulitzer..
Will you come on!
- Watch this.
One, please!
Sultan sucks!
- Happy birthday, Mrs. Ned Ashton... from me, the other Mrs. Ned Ashton.
- Oh, snap.
Yo, Grim, man.
Yo, check, this out, G.
Yo, this is a gift from Sultan.
{y: i} From Sultan, bro.
Yo.
- It' s your fault, man.
{y: i} - I' m sorry, man,
You all right, champ?
Let me see the ring.
- Damn!
- Damn!
- Damn!
You done came up, champ.
Wah, it' s bigger than the last one, bro,
- No question - by a good six, seven diamonds.
Oh, damn!
{y: i} I got this!
That was {y: i} a good try, though.
- You got that one.
- Yeah, you know I got that one.
I was mad quick, right?
- That was phat!
- Huh?
- [Chuckles]
- All right, man.
- Kick it in.
Shut up, Irv.
Damn.
Here you go, bro.
- That look nice on you, champ.
- That look all right?
It look nice on you.
You done came up like 7- Up, baby.
Yeah, it look nice on you, man.
Man!
{y: i} I didn' t want it anyway.
You know you wanted it.
{y: i} Shut up.
You got to stop eating this stuff... and do some road work.
Man, I could beat Conklin and my meat at the same time.
- But you got to be in some kind of shape.
- Oh, I' m in shape.
I' m round.
{y: i} Yo, Mike Tyson was round {y: i} when he fought Buster Douglas.
And Buster K. O. 'd him.
You know why?
'Cause Tyson wasn' t ready to fight.
Don' t worry, man.
When the bell ring, I' m in there.
Hey, Mr. Chump -- I mean, Mr. Champ.
I' d like to reintroduce you to an old friend.
Mr. Overhand Right.
Say, Mr. Roper, when you wake up in the hospital... realize your belt' s gone, come over to my house.
I' il let you try it on sometime, fat boy.
I like this kid.
Hey, Conklin, whoop, there it is.
The Nevada Boxing And Gaming Commission is pleased to announce... the results of the encephalograms... performed on the two contestants in this proposed bout.
James Roper' s encephalogram shows... no cortical lesions whatsoever.
And Mr. Conklin' s also shows no, uh, no significant braindamage.
{y: i} And this bout can proceed as scheduled.
What do you mean by "no significant brain damage"?
We haven' t seen Roper in weeks.
What' s up with that?
{y: i} He ain' t here because he' s ducking me.
{y: i} Ain' t that right, Rev?
{y: i} You know he gonna get knocked naked {y: i} from the waist down anyway.
He wants to continue fighting little punks like this here.
If he fights, {y: i} he' s gonna be blind, crippled and crazy.
Tell him about the deal, will you?
{y: i} Why don' t you piss off, {y: i} you fuckin 'monkey?
Hey, Mr. French, I will bust a cap in your ass.
Let me fucking get you, {y: i} - Calm down.
Come on.
Bring it on.
Sit you fat Pavarotti ass down!
Fuck you, fuck you
- Not me.
{y: i} - [All Shouting]
- Terry - What' s your problem?
You do.
I' m gonna whoop your white --
- Fuck waitin 'in line!
- What' s up?
Come on.
Tranquilize yourself, will you?
You' re scared.
You don' t want no part of this, do you, white boy?
You better go back where you came from before I rip your fuckin 'heart out.
What you got here, Rev, is shit.
Nothing!
Ohhh!
- You' re still in it.
We' re comin 'back in here.
"One- Punch" Terry Conklin, folks.
"One Punch" Terry.
- Fast hands for a white boy.
- Oh, we just sold 50, 000 more tickets.
{y: i} Now, that' s entertainment.
Ladies and gentlemen... we apologize for the behavior of Marvin Shabazz and his manager.
{y: i} But if Mr.. Shabazz {y: i} just shows a little patience... {y: i} I' m sure that Rev. Sultan
Oh, absolutely.
But we' re here to talk about Roper and Terry Conklin.
- We love you!
{y: i} Thank you, thank you.
May I?
We have here 100, 000... cards and letters, all for Terry Conklin.
{y: i} Let' s pick one at random, {y: i} shall we?
This one here.
Here, I' ve got, uh -- Let' s, uh -- Let' s see what we got here.
Uh, this one is from, um --
Gosh, it' s from a boy named Joey who' s in a wheelchair.
Mm- mm- mm.
He says -- He says um...
"If you become champ, Terry, I' il believe anything is possible.
Even walking again.
Love, Joey. "
{y: i} Terry, you' ve made a change.
I' il tell you, in the cynical age that we live in... it' s, uh -- it' s rare indeed... when someone or something... becomes so transcendent as Terry and this fight have become.
Kane!
{y: i} Kane.
What' s the matter?
What are you doing?
What are you hiding for?
Enjoying your job?
Don' t, uh --
Uh, I' m so --
I don' t know how to tell you this, but you, um -- you smell.
{y: i} [Chuckling]
Well, they took away my suite, after 20 years, like that.
- Hmm, well -- - You gotta protect yourself
You know, I' m not -- - Listen.
Please.
Listen.
The Sultan... is ripe for a fall.
Do you understand?
{y: i} Evereybody in the organization {y: i} is fed up with him.
It' s not just me.
We' ve been waiting for a new leader to emerge, and it' s you.
So I' m the, uh --
You take over his organization, and you get me my job back.
God sent you,
Are you okay?
Where you goin '?
Going to take a spronge bath.
Okay.
- Take it -- Take it easy.
{y: i} - I will.
{y: i} Hey, Siegfried!
{y: i} Who' s that behind -- Who?
{y: i} Come on, fellows.
{y: i} That isn' t funny.
I' m not Irish.
You' ve got a lovely chest.
Lovely.
{y: i} You' re a fucking stallion!
- Terry Conklin!
- Terry Conklin!
Stay down, boy!
Told you to stay down!
{y: i} How do you like Las Vegas, Terry?
What' s that?
{y: i} How does it compare {y: i} to Cleveland?
Cleveland' s a real city with real people... who aren' t concerned with bourgeois attitudes... concerned with sexism, racism, religiousism... or any of the other kind of "isms" that Vegas is about.
Las Vegas is one of the most exploitive places I' ve ever seen in my life... particularly exploitive towards women.
I' ve never been to a city more exploitive towards women.
[Snorts]
{y: i} - But wasn' t that you on the cover of Playboy magazine?
What' s that?
That was me on the cover of Playboy magazine, but let me say two things.
One, I hated it; and two, that' s not what I' m about.
{y: i} - So how' s the champ lookin '?
- He' s looking good.
Did you see him out there?
{y: i} - No.
We can' t get in to see him.
- It was a great workout.
{y: i} You should' ve seen the last workout {y: i} today.
He' s looking excellent.
So what about all {y: i} these reports of all this roomservice?
{y: i} Uh, 10 gallons of icecream... {y: i} uh, a carton of Gummi Bears, {y: i} all the porkskins in Vegas,
The champ has {y: i} an entourage.
He feeds' em.
{y: i} So he' s not eating any of this stuff?
Even if the champ {y: i} were not in perfect condition... {y: i} he' s still {y: i} a professional fighter..
{y: i} He' s got savvy.
{y: i} He knows how to breathe in a ring.
- Is racism driving this fight?
I don' t think so.
{y: i} - [Woman Singing]
Are we exploiting a history of divisive racial struggle in this country?
I don' t think so.
Two bucks on the clean- cut white boy, please.
Thank you,
- To play the piano, you need the black keys -- - And the white keys.
Doing a rock opera about the homeless situation in Cleveland.
I think it' s applicable universally... to the homelessness situation in any major American market.
For example, South Dakota -- there' s a homelessness situation that' s been brought to my attention.
{y: i} for your acts of charity.
Ain' t nobody' s business what I do with my money.
{y: i} We' ve found that you' ve given large {y: i} donations of money to a number of places -- {y: i} AlDS organizations, {y: i} multiple sclerosis.
{y: i} You visit children' s hospitals {y: i} in every town you go into.
I' m about to donate some money to the Remove My Foot From Your Ass Foundation.
This is over.
{y: i} So you' re quite a rock 'n' roller..
I still am quite a rock 'n' roller.
Thanks for mentioning that.
Without further objections, I would like to sing my song... that I' ve just been working on to Mr. Roper.
{y: i} - Yeah.
Let' s hear it.
It' s called "Mr. Roper, Mr. Roper."
I' m gonna open a case of butt- whippin '
Butt- whippin 'butt- whippin', butt- whippin 'butt- whippin'
Butt- whippin '
Butt- whippin '
Butt- whippin '
Butt- whippin '
It' s called "Mr. Roper, Mr. Roper."
You just wanna blow this fight, don' t ya?
Look, Titus, Chill.
My blackness will beat that kid.
He looks good.
He looks good.
Yeah.
Looks is what counts, isn' t it?
Hey, hey, um, now, you know, if he wins, have you thought about --
[Laughs]
Oh, man, yeah.
If he wins, uh, what are your plans after that?
Have you thought about that?
Like, are you happy with your deal with Sultan?
Happy?
I' d sooner be turked by a syphillitic bear.
Tu- Turk -- Hmm, that' s interesting.
"Turked"?
What is "turked"?
- Rectally relieved.
- Oh, geez.
So, what, after -- after this fight, you' d consider signing him with another promoter?
Or a, uh, smart younger man such as yourself?
Well, I don' t like to toot my own horn, but --
- Is that what you' re saying?
- Well --
Terry
Terry!
Get over here!
- What' s up, Johnny?
We may have found ourselves a great white hope.
- Oh, do -- - He wants to promote you,
You?
- Yeah, maybe so.
What about Mr. Sultan?
Uh, Mr. Sultan, you know, not so good for you guys.
He' il get what he needs, you know -- [Mutters]
[Clears Throat]
- Do you covet racism?
How do you mean, covet?
- Are you a racist person?
- No, I' m not.
Johnny?
- Too much of it.
- No, really, I believe that.
Gosh.
Can I have a hug?
Sure.
Oh!

That shit don' t faze me.
- heavyweight champion of the world -- - Aah!

{y: i} [Audience Gasps]
Roper looks at least 220.
{y: i} That man' s been eating {y: i} chitlins or something.
The champion... wighs an official 238 pounds!
Hold it, hold it, hold it!
The champ has a few words he wants to say to y' all!
I just want to say that after 38 fights... 38 wins by knockout, this is all the love you show me?
We love you, Roper.
- Well, the rest of y' all... can kiss my big, black, bloated, Rolls- Royce- driving ass.
- [Cheering]
All right, all right!
{y: i} - All right!
I want to thank you all for coming out here today.
And I want to ask yourself the question:
Is it hope, or is it hype?
We' il find out the answer tomorrow night.
See you at the MGM Grand!
Thank you!
{y: i} There he is.
I love this outfit.
{y: i} Is that a unitard?
{y: i} Mitchell.
Great news.
The gate went over 110 million today.
By fight time tomorrow, it should be 125.
I how to you,
- I sit at your feet.
- This has been a brilliant partnership.
I hope it' s the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
It' s the beginning... of... something.
Hey, baby, you feeling all right?
Oh, baby, listen.
I' m, uh -- I' m concerned that the, uh, champ... is maybe too far gone to beat this Conklin kid.
No fucking way the champ loses this fight.
He' s gonna kill this kid.
He' s got that... tummy.
You' re starting to believe your own bullshit.
Relax.
- The fight' s a lock.
{y: i} - You would know.
You' re the paisley pooh- bah.
{y: i} - Hmm.
The champ and I have our little disagreements.
Hell, my whole organization does.
{y: i} Bottom line:
{y: i} He loves me.
And I love him.
- And I love them.
- You know what else?
- What' s that?
I love you,
I gotta get one of those.
- You' re my brother.
- From the brother of brothers.
{y: i} Oh, God.
- Hey!
The fervor charts go off the wall when the challenger is -- when the challenger' s --
There, I' ve said it, Doc.
White.
- I' m glad you said it, Stu.
Roper is a jungle animal.
He wants to do unspeakable things to your mother and your sister.
Johnny, you do not have to whip me into a racist frenzy to beat this man.
- We all know you' re a racist bastard.
- Me, a racist?
- You' re a pig.
- I am not a racist.
I' m a bloody Englishman, the fairest people on the planet, mate.
{y: i} If I was a racist, I wouldn' t be training {y: i} you, you stupid muck- shoveling Mick.
What have we got here, then, Paddy, eh?
White gloves.
You disgust me.
No, Terry, no.
That' s a good idea.
You should do it.
Nice touch.
Wait.
Wait a second.
Let me -- Let me tell you something.
Out now.
Oh, yeah.
Oh yeah.
You think the public' s just falling in love with me... because of the color of my skin.
- {y: i} [Bagpipes Playing]
You know?
Shame on you.
I am more than hope... and I' m a hell of a lot more than hype.
I' m a young man in fantastic shape... with a devastating overhand right... that is going to shock the world.
Don' t you forget I never lost a fight.
Attaboy, Terry!
You kick his black ass!
It is the ass of a human being, man!
{y: i} A human being!
That is the ass that I' m going to kick tonight.
I love you, Terry
I love you too.
Bang!
Bang!
Bang!
{y: i} Conklin!
{y: i} - [Doc]
{y: i} Is that a circus entrance?
{y: i} Is it a fighter coming in or a clown?
{y: i} The guy thinks this is a rock concert.
Maybe we' re in the wrong place.
{y: i} Maybe this is a rock concert.
{y: i} - [Woman Shouting]
Yeah!
All right!
None of the experts {y: i} give this kid a chance.
{y: i} Yet, can a hundred million fans {y: i} across America be wrong?
If Conklin had started earlier in his career, would he be the champion?
- Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
- [Audience]
Conklin!
Conklin!
- Yeah! it' s obvious that the champion is delaying his entrance into the arena.
I' m just thinking, is he trying psychologically... to toy with the mind of the challenger?
{y: i} Will y' all back up?
{y: i} I' m trying to watch the show.
{y: i} - That shit ain' t mine.
You' re gonna have to take me!
You wanna cut that junk off and get rid of that cigarette? my inspiration tape, okay?
Hey, I' m tryin 'to tell you this is the number one contender right here, baby.
That' s what I' m sayin '.
We up in here, and he needs to be in the ring.
Hey, Shabazz, how you doin '?
You gonna talk to me like you know me now?
You gonna disrespect me 'cause you threw a sucker punch?
I' il show you little white ass -- {y: i} [Johnny]
El, man, I' m sorry.
{y: i} I didn' t know it was you.
Come here.
No, no.
I' m right here.
Look this way.
You got work to do.
Wait till after the love scene.
The champion has still not come in, and the challenger seems bewildered.
He just keeps circling around.
He could get tired.
Stu, do you think there could be anything wrong?
I' il tell you what it is, Johnny.
The boy is scared of me.
- He' s scared of me.
- Well, it' s a possibillity.
- But, just in case, don' t get him mad, eh?
- He' s scared of me.
- Ref, come on.
My boy' s -- - Roper?
Huh, boy?
Roper!
Oh, yeah, he' s scared of me!
Come on, Roper!
Come and catch a butt- whippin '!
[Grunting]
Kiss the mule!
I' m gonna make him kiss the donkey, ref.
He gonna kiss the donkey.
He' s gonna smooch with the donkey.
I' m gonna bust him up.
Bust him up!
Time for the comeuppance, yes!
Time for the comeuppance, yes!
You rat- soup- eatin 'honky motherfucker!
Okay!
Now I' m mad.
Irv!
May the Lord bless you.
May the Spirit guide you.
And may the heavens rain down their bounty upon you.
- May the -- - Nigga, grow up, {y: i} [Man Rapping]
Go for it.
Let' s see your gloves, champ.
Looks good to me.
Go, Roper!
Hey, Bambi, don' t distract the champ with that, all right?
Vincent, how you doin ', baby?
How' s everything, huh?
Huh?
Good to see you.
Mitch, Mitch, Mitch, Mitch.
Sit here.
Julio, get up,
Come on, come on, come on.
Sit.
- Best seat in the house right here, man.
- There we go.
It' s hard to imagine how a popular champion... could become so unpopular in such a short period of time.
Yeah, that' s a story, but the other story is there 20 pounds this guy' s carrying.
{y: i} How can he come in -- Look at {y: i} the belly hanging over his trunks.
{y: i} - That' s a disgrace.
{y: i} The guy never met a meal he didn' t like.
This is where the action is, seeing a show these are...
- the last few moments
What the fuck are you talking about?
The new heavyweight champ of the world, Terry Conklin, has signed with me.
- We' il see about that shit.
- Yes, we will.
[Laughs]
All right, you guys, I gave you instructions in the dressing room.
Is there any questions?
I have one question.
- What?
Well, I was just wondering up there to Mr. Roper... {y: i} what do you think it' s gonna feel like {y: i} to lose to an amateur, chump?
Shut up, and let your fist do the talking.
Shake hands and good luck.
Good luck fatboy,
- Am I that fat?
- No, just a whole lot of man.
Terry, listen to me.
Do this for the white race.
- I' m ignoring your racism.
This one' s for the homeless.
The tension is building here at the MGM Grand... and it feels like we' re going to have a meltdown.
And here we go for the heavyweight championship of the world.
{y: i} - [Bell Rings]
- All right, Conklin!
Do the work, champ.
Do it!
No holding.
Watch your head.
{y: i} Punch or get out.
- Get outta there!
- I' m playin 'with him!
- Well, turn him loose and fight!
- I got him right where I want him!
Come on, fatboy!
{y: i} Watch that overhand right.
{y: i} Watch that overhand right!
The champ is pissed off now!
- Look out!
- Look at this!
Go!
Hell, yeah!
Hell, yeah!
Oh, yes!
You the man, champ!
{y: i} Terry, get up!
Six, seven -- {y: i} Nine, 10!
{y: i} - [Bell Rings]
It is over!
- [Audience Booing]
Twenty- seven seconds into the first round, it' s all over!
Man, this wasn' t a fight.
This was an execution.
That' s it?
What the hell is this microwave- fight bullshit?
{y: i} [Laughs]
{y: i} [Laughs]
- Congratulation.
- Thank you!
- We reap what we sow.
Yes, Mitch, yes.
[Laughing]
We reap what we sow.
- Guess that' s kind of like
- Sit down, mate.
Sit down.
- That' s a good idea.
- How' re you doing?
- Where' s my midget?
He' s on Queer Street.
Listen.
Just quickly, if anybody starts talking rematch, you know --
- No rematch.
No rematch.
- Good.
I' m going back to Cleveland, gonna play rock 'n' roll, man.
That' s right.
The best thing to do with this crowd is walk away.
- Whatever, man.
Good.
Now, take it easy.
- I' m gonna go.
- You know what you need in rock 'n' roll?
Management.
I just had a -- I just had a --
You' re woozy.
I just wanted to put a bee in your bonnet.
I' il call ya.
I want my money {y: i} back, you crooks!
- Let' s get him up.
- Hey, you knocked him cold.
- Way to kick that ass!
- You' re supposed to!
- Get the champ some peanut butter brickle ice cream!
- Yeah, spread it all over the ring girls.
- Champion- rolla!
- Who are you?
Peter Prince.
[Laughing]
- I know who you are, man.
- Oh, my bad.
- Artemus, how' d we do?
- Artemus, how' d we do? $132 million gate.
{y: i} - That' s a lot of fuckin 'money.
That' s right, and we haven' t even counted the gate here yet.
{y: i} Wait till we box up {y: i} the videos of this fight.
{y: i} It' s not like we were {y: i} gonna pay Conklin anyway.
Sultan, we need to talk.
You need to respect that.
What' s up with that outfit?
- You Ali Baba Jackson up in this motherfucker?
- Oh, not this nigga.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Easy, frosty man.
{y: i} - Hey, Ruk' n!
I' m tired of you and the Grinch That Stole Blackness stealin 'my glory.
Ain' t nobody stealin 'your glory.
You' re a disgrace.
He look like a half- sucked Milk Dud, I swear.
{y: i} You' re sorry.
What you wanna do?
What' s up?
- Champ, it' s just good publicity for the next fight.
- I' m tired of this.
Every time I have a moment, here comes Mutt and Jeff to ruin it.
Well, stop talking and step to me.
You ain' t fought nobody.
- Your shit stops now.
- Hey, man.
What do you want?
What do you want?
Why' re you acting like you wanna do something?
You know and I know you don' t.
Huh?
{y: i} Didn' t I tell you?
- Don' t be puttin 'your -- You ain' t my daddy.
{y: i} Matter of fact, {y: i} my nerves is had anyway.
If I can get this motherfucker out -- Hey, hey.
He' s got a gun!
I' il do a walk- by up in here.
Who the champ now?
Who the champ now?
I' m runnin 'with you.
- You' re the champ. and I just want some respect.
Will you?
We' re seeing a championship fight after a championship fight.
This is incredible!
There' s a second fight goin 'right now.
Don' t give away what we can sell!
Damn!
You all right, champ?
That' s all you got for me?
Who' s the champ?
{y: i} Who' s the champ?
{y: i} I am, baby!
Next time, I' il break my foot off in your ass!
You have just seen a preview of the marvelous fight to come... between "Malevolent" Marvin Shabazz... and James "The Grip Reaper" Roper!
This is the beauty of America!
May the best man win!
I love it!
And I love you!
{y: i} [Woman Singing]
One hundred girls.
And one of them is my true love.
My forever soul mate.
The Betty to my Barney.
My cosmetic destiny.
I don' t know who she is.
I was leaving a highball bash in the girl' s dorm.
Can you hit the basement button, please?
My back was to her when that auspicious blackout hit.
I never got a chance to see her.
It must' ve been the cloak of darkness concealing my usual romantic block.
Because that night I was smart, I was funny, I was invincible
Did you ever notice in the movie "Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"... that the 0ompa Loompas never wore hairnets?
Do you know what I really hate?
Those stickers they put on apples.
By the time you peel it off, you don' t want the apple anymore.
I sometimes wish I could just crawl up with a girl.
Just hold each other.
Like that picture of John Lennon and Yoko 0no.
That is so sweet.
And that' s when it happened.
And our hands began displaying their in credible night vision.
Her little breasts were just the right size to fill... a champagne glass.
My impressive man hood in my pants expanded like popcorn.
We never knew each other' s names.
Maybe it was the mystery of if all that made it so exciting.
in the morning...
she was gone.
I had to find her.
I didn' t get much support from my roommate Rod.
What you' re getting so bad out of shape for, man?
- I mean, it' s just a girl.
- I should' ve expected you to say that.
- What do you mean?
- I mean you' re the kind of guy... who likes those silhouettes of naked women on the mud flaps of trucks.
- You revel in the size of your dumps.
- Hey, Matt!
You gotta check this out!
Yeah, I do all those things.
This isn' t just another girl, Rod.
I connected with her.
The last intimate encounter I had with a woman was when I was five.
Id pulled down my pants, and Vickie poured sand on my winky.
This is better than playing with you shovel, man.
Ever since then, I' ve had this burning need for a woman.
I started taping my pecker so that it would stay up all the time.
I did the same thing, but I used duct tape, man.
Shut up, I' m trying to make a point here.
I' ve never had this kind of success with a woman before.
When I was 16, I tried talking to girls.
I had to write myself cheat notes... on my hands so I had a list of topics I could talk to the girls about.
- What' s that on your hand?
- Nothing.
My romantic IQ must' ve mashed me, because I showed the girl my list.
It' s all sorts of things I can talk to you about.
I thought I was the biggest loser of all time.
It wasn' t as bad as senior prom, when I spent US$ 150 on Emily... and didn' t even get a kiss of good night.
So you can imagine how impassioned I feel now I' ve actually met this girl.
You' re pathetic, man!
I mean, you lose your virginity... and you don' t even get the girl' s name!
- What the hell is that?
- It' s penile power, man.
I got it out of an ad in a magazine, you know?
It' s gonna help me increase length and girth by hanging weights, man!
- Check it out, I' m up to 5 pounds.
- It' s the stroker, not the poker.
Man, I' m doing this for me.
Like I always say...
"The angle of the dangle equals the cubic of the pubic".
- What' s that have to do with anything?
- I don' t know.
I just like to say it.
This penile power thing is gonna help me increase my libido... help me maintain a full firm erection... and it' s gonna help me control my ejaculation, baby.
- So I' m gonna do it all night long!
- When do you start junior high?
I' m serious.
Check this out.
This is Kung Chang, right?
Master of penile power.
He' s lifting 500 pounds with his penis, man!
Great, that' s useful! is he gonna enter himself in a tractor pull?
Whatever, man.
So what are you gonna do about this girl?
- She left this.
- Hey, man, let me see that!
- Hey, give them back!
What are you gonna do?
You' re gonna boil them and make soup?
You don' t want a girlfriend.
Jesus.
And then there' s the other thing.
You' d spend every Friday night... watching movies adapted from the latest Jane Austen book.
- You don' t want that, man!
- It' s pretty cold, Rod.
Listen, when it comes to men and women, men get a raw deal.
For centuries, we' ve been killing over 15 years before our wives... and all because of all the stress in the work place, right?
But not once have they apologized, man... for all the millions of years of life we' ve lost working... while women stayed home.
I couldn' t understand why Rod hated women so much.
I suspected there was some past horror that made him this way.
Man, all you gotta do is find the matching bra to those panties.
- Mystery solved!
- That' s not a half bad idea.
You' re never gonna get in the Virgin Vault, man.
They don' t let boys in the girls' side, alright?
- No, this will work.
- You' re high, man.
0n my own testosterone, maybe.
Come with me.
What are you doing, man?
Rod, I focused all my great cerebral powers... to come up with this bold plan to penetrate the Vault.
What are you?
Coyote super genius or something?
Something like that.
Wait!
The Coyote never caught the Roadrunner, man!
Got you!
Hi, I' m Matt, the new maintenance man.
Had a call about some rats.
Man in the hall!
Getting my female suspects just about off their rooms... was as easy as giving away free hair- care products to girls.
It was as if I was a perverted Prince Charming. instead of Cinderella' s glass slippers, I had her panties
I miss you.
What you mean, you just wanna be friends?
- Get off me!
- Put that away and give me some.
- It' s gonna be okay.
Come on, baby.
- Jesus, can' t you see I' m busy?!
- Put that stupid shit away, alright?
- Crick, get off!
It' s time to give me some, alright?
Just relax, alright?
You stapled my ass!
- What are you doing?
- Stop it!
He was gonna kill me.
I just hoped to get in... a few verbal punches before he went Mike Tyson on me.
- Who are you?
- I' m Matthew.
Your name' s Crick.
As in "Crick without a paddle".
I' ve seen you around.
- You' re a natural born hipster.
- Natural born hipster?
The next evolution of a jock.
You traded in your letterman jacket... for a manicured goatee and an Euro trash ponytail.
You' re the worst kind of cool, the kind who wears male make- up.
A real fashion plate.
You' re living proof of those boy- toy do of uses in those men' s magazines!
But better me than her.
What was the worse?
Crick was hopped upon nicotine gum.
What the hell are you doing here?
- I' m here so save her.
- Save her?
How are you gonna do that?
Crick wasn' t wearing a shirt.
I don' t know what possessed me.
Probably his incessant nicotine- gum chewing.
I grabbed his nipples and did a double twist.
But, somehow, through his blur of pain, Crick fought back.
He grabbed my nipples and twisted.
Locked in a nipple combat.
Each trying to endure the retching pains the longest.
Each of us waiting for the other to blink.
I cracked.
I' il be back for your ass!
And I' il deal with you later!
Here, have some Midol.
It does the trick when my nipples get sore during my period.
Thanks.
Let me see.
They' re all bruised.
They are two black eyes.
We should put something cold on them.
- You' re bruised too.
- Don' t worry, I' m used to it.
You' re Patty, huh?
You do that comic in the school newspaper.
- That' s me.
- An art - school girl, huh?
- Is that what you call me?
- No, I wasn' t calling you anything. in high school, you would have called me a slut.
Now in college, you call me a good time.
You like my skirt, but you' re thinking:
"lf her skirt were any shorter, she' d have other cheeks to powder... and would have to put gloss on another pair of lips".
I wasn' t thinking any of that.
I think you' re a nice girl.
I was lying.
I did think all those things.
She may not be perfect, but she oozed sex more than a sponge contraceptive.
She had a cuteness that set off my hair- trigger response.
She got my pecker to strain like a dog on a leash.
What?
What' s wrong?
- Nothing, I' m sorry.
- I' m trying to make it all better.
I' m all better.
- No.
I like you just fine.
You' re worried about what people say about me.
I' ve never heard anything.
Sure you have. "lf she still has a cherry, it must be pushed so back...... she can use it as a taillight".
- I' ve never heard that.
Yes, you have.
My reputation precedes me.
It' s okay.
You know, I' m all for experimentation.
What are these?
Are these stress balls?
To relieve tension, like Humphrey Bogart did in that old movie.
"There' s three ways to do things aboard my vessel.
The right way, the wrong way and my way.
- Those are my pinball balls.
- What?
Pinball balls.
I put them inside of me, I rock my legs and I get off.
Really?
0kay, I' m sorry, I have to go.
- Hey, Matt.
- What' s the matter with you?
Penile power.
It seems to be causing a little pain, if you know what I mean.
- So what' s plan B, Mr. Coyote?
- I' m gonna continue searching.
So they let me into fixit.
Man in the hall!
Once inside, I just figure out a way to get in the girls' rooms.
This is Phil Gambone calling from KR0K radio.
You won the morning prize.
A new car.
You should' ve been there the day I turned the air- conditioner off.
It was a feast for the eyes!
And there was Cynthia Dessert, the "crème" of womanhood.
She loomed as a titan in my masturbatory dreams.
She' s the perfect example of the power women holdover men.
We' re paralyzed by their beauty.
We' re rendered speechless by it.
If we' re lucky to say anything to them, it all sounds like gibberish.
You' re Matt, the maintenance guy, right?
I need some help in my room.
How can a guy have a real conversation with a girl like this... when we' re made so helpless?
In the animal kingdom, when 2members stare at each other... it is a test of dominance.
The first one to look away is considered the weaker.
Between a man and a woman, cards are stacked against the man.
Because, let' s face it, every time a guy meets a girl... he wants to check out her breasts.
A man must summon all his will not to lookdown at those golden orbs... whose wondrous tips are upturned, aimed right at his eyes.
Like a sexual sorceress, Cynthia had several men under her spell.
You can use my desk- top PC anytime you want, all semester.
I have an extra pizza.
I thought you might want it.
When you' re done, I just need some help moving some furniture.
Thanks for getting this masterpiece theater!
- Strange, it was getting only ESPN.
- Yeah, it' s weird.
- Anybody for a game of foosball?
- No, thanks.
Come on, you guys!
What about you, maintenance boy?
You wanna play?
Just one game!
I' m talking one game here.
Unfortunately, I didn' t heed the warnings.
Arlene suckered me into a game of strip foosball.
The loser of each goal will have to remove one article of clothing.
Prepare to get naked.
I don' t know why you girls get such fiendish delight in defeating men.
- We' ve been emasculated all life.
- You' re just trying to distract me.
I' m serious.
My mom taught me who was boss when I was 5 years old.
She started spanking me with a wooden spoon.
We' ve been forced into submissive roles all our lives.
You might as well be wearing those little French maid outfits.
Your dumb stories will not throw me off my game.
Let me tell you.
I' ve never felt more manly then the day my mother broke her spoon... on my hard buttocks.
The tyranny of the spoon was over, and my ass was liberated.
Until today.
I' m kicking your hole.
My greatest fear was being realized.
What if one of these girls was my elevator Aphrodite?
What if she saw me getting beaten by a girl?
It' s goal time.
Score!
Now I wanna see my trophy.
Thank God I turned the thermostat up that day... otherwise my man hood would' ve recoiled like a turtlehead... instead of hanging out like an anaconda waiting for a match.
Man, you lost to a girl?
Yeah, and my pride shrank like my scrotum on a snow day.
Speaking of scrotum, I think I can... add a little weight.
I' m up to 10 pounds, baby.
I wonder why God equipped women with all the weapons for seduction?
What do you mean?
Take the breasts, for example.
You' ve the bosom... the aureole... the nipple.
Three concentric circles. in other words, it' s the bull' s eye.
Its no wonder the breast is the target for all men.
- That' s profound.
like cleaning our ears with our car keys.
We' re grotesque to the core.
Look at the penis.
It looks like God had some left- over skin when he was making elbow...... and he slapped in our groin.
- Man, it freaks me out.
The penis is the first to shrivel when it' s cold... and it' s the first to shrink in fear.
The penis is a cowardly flap of left- over elbow flesh.
You wouldn' t think that way if you had a little of my penile power.
I screwed up the air- conditioning in the Virgin Vault again today.
This time is too hot, so that girls will strip down to next to nothing.
I should be getting a call anytime now to fix it.
- Do you have any suspects yet?
- No, there' s too many choices.
Their dorm is a Whitman sampler of women!
A virtual pot- pourri of pussy.
It' s more than sex.
Those women have distinct personalities.
Look over there.
You see that girl?
I call her Ever Tan Barbara.
Who' s the girl with the magic markers up there?
It' s René.
She writes cheat notes on her breasts.
See next door?
That' s Sasha.
She' s totally into purple.
Have you seen that girl at the front desk, Rhonda?
She can be really cute, but she has this habit of picking her eyebrows.
Yeah, nice from afar, but far from nice!
And you' re right.
Some girls watch Jane Austen movies every Friday.
The literary world has a term for those fanatics.
"Janeites".
My God, let' s watch it tonight.
I' il make the popcorn!
There' s this girl Penny.
Ever seen her?
She' s always on the phone crying with her long- distance boyfriend.
- I' ve seen her around.
Who' s that girl with the green slime, man?
You' ve found Dana.
She' s on a all- algae diet.
- And who' s the hummer on three?
- That' s Michelle.
She sounds like some kind of Buddhist monk, don' t you think?
So, have you got any more suspicious suspects yet?
I have that one girl who never comes out of her room.
I just hear a little bit of rustling.
I bet you that she' s your mystery woman.
- Hurry up, the movie is at 7: 30.
- I can' t lock the door.
Forget about it.
We' re gonna miss the trailer for "North anger Abbey".
Saturday nights were the best for sneaking into girls' rooms.
They went out on dates or home for the weekend.
The dorm was empty.
Except for Dora.
She never had anywhere to go on Saturday night.
I did have to admit I' ve seen cuter girls in "National Geographic".
She' s the kind of girl about whom Rod would say...
I wouldn' t even screw her with your dick, man.
But I felt for her.
When you' re not good- looking, you become a failure by default.
People treat you like you have the Ebola virus.
They don' t wanna get near, because what you have might be contagious.
It' s cruel.
This Women Studies class is gonna be a breeze.
We get to check out all the pretty girls.
I think we made a really big mistake.
Today we are gonna study patriarchal infrastructures... that exercise gender- based discrimination.
Who can give me examples?
The pope won' t allow women priests.
Why can a man be promiscuous, but a woman is called a slut?
Why is it called "his story", instead of "her story"?
Why women shoes are always so uncomfortable?
- Very good.
The boys in the back, would you care to contribute?
You enrolled in my class to meet girls, didn' t you?
There' s a couple of you every semester.
None of you ever last.
Great
I need to maintain at least 3. 75 GPA to keep my scholar ship.
Now Elsa, of the SS, is gonna make me lose it.
I' il enjoy teaching you boys a lesson.
One Saturday, I got careless.
Disasters truck moments after I had to drain my main vein.
Women have a sixth sense.
They know when something is a miss.
They see things that go undetected to a man' s eye.
From the slightest detail, she knew there had been a male presence.
And I was such a fool.
I had left behind the most damning piece of evidence.
But this girl was a pro.
She could have been trained by my mother
My eyes!
Matthew?
It' s me, Wendy, from eleventh grade Trig!
We all sat in the back because Mr. Perialas had such a bad breath.
I' m looking for this girl. lf you don' t believe me, check my right pocket.
- I have her panties in there.
- I believe you.
- So you' re gonna check every girl?
- lf I can ever see again!
This is so romantic!
Hey, I' il help you!
I' m a sucker for matchmaking!
I wanna let you know, we' re gonna be doing the lights today, okay?
I just want to let you know that you' re hair looks really cute.
And that' s all.
Bye- bye.
With the help of my faithful companion Wendy, I found a match.
It was hours.
Finally my romantic quest was rewarded.
She was a goddess.
More than I could ever possibly have hoped for.
I was corrupt with happiness. immediately declared all the feelings I had had for her.
I think even the word "love" was used.
I love you.
She kept me frozen in suspense, as awaited for her response.
Needless to say, my spirits crashed like a karmic Kinden berg.
Stop soaking, man.
Don' t you get it?
Women are nothing but trouble!
Great.
Here we go again.
Hear me out, man.
Women complain that all men want... their girls to look like models, and it makes them angry... that they have to live up to this expectation.
We live with the disappointment that our women won' t look like it.
They ever take that in consideration?
No.
We' ve been conditioned to expect something that we' il never get!
And what' s worse!
Men age better than women.
While we get better over time, we get with women with saggy tits... who start wearing those bathing suits that cover the belly- buttons!
Then, they get those short asexual haircuts, and their thunder thighs!
Making love to a woman turns a man into a cellulite surfer!
Who gets the better in the deal?
I wonder what prom- night succubus or second- date siren... had in stilled him such zealous misogyny.
Can you believe?
I' ve gained a half an inch since I started using this!
Where do you start when you measure your dick, man?
Alright, admit it.
I' ve measured my dick.
Weal have.
But the evolved man that I was, I didn' t wanna give Rodman answer.
- In your case, from the neck up.
- Screw you, man!
So, hey, what are you reading?
I was just checking to make sure the paper printed my ad.
I' ve no clue anymore how to find my black- out knock- out... so every week I take up a personal ad in the school newspaper... telling my mystery girl that I' il be waiting every Thursday night... in the basement of the Virgin Vault.
So, in complete darkness, we can renew our relationship... until both of us decide to reveal our identities.
You sit in the dark every Thursday night?
You' re a sick man.
You' re a freak!
I' m outta here.
- Alright, man.
Take it easy.
And if she' s easy, take her twice.
My whole operation was a romantic bay of pigs.
Id already spent several Thursday nights in the dark... and she' d yet to show up.
It' s me.
Wendy.
- She didn' t come, did she?
- No.
- How did you know I was down here?
- I read your personal ad.
It' s after midnight.
She' s probably not gonna show.
Come for a food.
Wendy was the über- girl next door.
A testament to why women in our society are cheer- leaders.
Everything she did was perfect.
She was arousing in that virginal MaryAnn, not Ginger sort of way.
This kind of girl is scary.
She' s the kind of girl you take home to mom.
And even scarier, she' s the kind you marry and she becomes your mom.
leaves notes on toilettes telling you what chores need to be done.
She' s scary because you could see yourself falling for her.
But, at the same time, you feel that if you fall for her... you' re settling for just the average.
What?
You' re just so perfect.
I hate when people say that.
I don' t wanna be perfect.
So my dad had polio when he was a kid... and he had this really bad leg.
And whenever he walked... he made this creepy... thumping noise.
And just super creepy.
I remember him coming home from work and... walking down the long hallway to kiss me good night.
I was scared because all I could hear was the thumping, you know?
So I hid under my covers. is it not sad to be so afraid of your father?
That Margaret Hamilton... who does the wicked witch was so hair- raising, you know?
And that music... it scared me so much.
I' d get so scared I couldn' t sleep, `cause it' d get stuck in my head.
Sometimes, do you know what I did to calm myself?
I remembered that Dorothy killed the witch by putting water on her.
And I knew that if the witch came to get me I' d just spit on her... and she' d melt.
I just told you a sad story about my family, and that' s all you can say?
I' m sorry.
I' m tragically glib.
Men have this anti- intimacy force field a round them... that is powered by sarcasm, humor and a version.
Why is that?
The force is strong with this one.
Maybe it' s because a man can fall in love with a different girl everyday.
Maybe it' s just nature' s way of protecting a man from himself.
How do you feel about the name "Francesca"?
Do you know that Muslim men shave their pubic hairs?
No wonder so many of them become terrorists!
I can' t breathe!
I can' t see!
Fascinating!
Can you blame guys for being so horny?
Look at the dress.
It' s one big symbol for easy access.
Have you ever calculated how many hours' women have wasted... deciding on what kind of shoes to wear?
Foxy lady!
Trust me.
They will get drunk, they do it every Thursday night.
And they talk about everything once they' re plastered.
So, as Francesca, try to make one of them... reveal that she had sex on an elevator in a black- out.
Did I ever tell you about when I got a bloody nose while giving head?
0nce I got my gum stuck in the guy' s pubis while giving a blow job.
I' ve got you all beaten.
When I was about to swallow it, I laughed and it came out my nose.
Girls are way grosser than guys!
A friend had sex in an elevator.
Have any of you ever tried that?
I have it.
I had a boyfriend who liked to rub it between my toes.
Then he blamed when he got athlete' s foot on his dong!
Francesca' s night was a major bust.
That stunk!
Well, maybe you just need to try something different, you know? instead of hoping for hard evidence on your romantic suspect... maybe you should just get to know these girls.
You might get a vibe as to which one she is.
You' re right.
I do need to do something I' ve been avoiding.
I need to lower my anti- intimacy shield.
If you had a choice, would you rather be warm or smart?
So, why is it purple?
Isn' t "American cheese" appropriately named?
It' s fake and processed, just like America.
Tell me something... who' s the idiot who invented the buttoned- down fly?
There are dogs who sniff melanoma in humans before it' s diagnosed.
like hurricane Andrew?
You never hear Giuseppe or Mohammed.
Why older people pull their pants up over their belly- buttons?
Why in golf is it good to shoot under par... but a sub- par performance in anything else is bad?
Do you know what the best phrase is?
"I' m ready for anything".
I can' t speak to Cynthia as Matt.
I start speaking gibberish.
But I have a silver tongue with her when I am Francesca!
These things are supposed to get rid of cellulite.
Come on.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.
How often do you bikini wax?
- Everyday.
- I thought I was a fanatic!
God, that' s Sam!
He cannot see me with these pants and no make- up!
Wait, wait a second!
I got your term paper!
I even got one of those plastic covers!
You don' t have to...
Hold on a second!
I' il come to you!
- Come on!
- I' m coming, Cynthia!
- So what' s the big deal?
I get things easy.
The guys will do anything for me because of the way I look.
I know that.
And if Sam saw me in these...
I might lose my edge with him.
Like at "Green Legend", they lost the power ring.
- Who?
- Never mind.
You' re lucky.
No, I' m not.
It' d be great if guys always wanted to do things for me.
No, it' s a curse.
You see... nothing is a challenge for me.
Everything is made easy.
And if I ever actually do something on my own... everyone assumes that I got there because of my looks.
It sucks.
So ready to go again?
It' s just easier to talk to Cynthia as a girl than as a guy.
- There' s nothing at stake.
- How do you mean?
When you' re a guy talking to a girl like her, you' re going for all the marbles.
She' s a Super Bowl of women.
And you know, if you screw up and she rejects you... then every other girl after Cynthia is gonna seem like a compromise.
And you just know you aren' t good enough to get a girl like her.
That' s why I don' t talk to girls in her league.
I just don' t wanna know that I' ve crashed and burned.
I won' t ever get the opportunity to put her ring around my 11th finger.
What are you reading?
- Nothing.
- It' s gotta be something.
Why are you talking to me?
I don' t know.
It' s quiet around here.
I' m Matthew.
- What' s your name?
- Ghost face.
What?
- They called me so in high school.
- I' m sorry.
It' s okay.
I kind of like it.
It' s better than being called...
"The Poster Child for Abortion" or "The Girl with the Vertical Smile".
I was trying to be friendly.
Maybe she could tell still thought she was contagious.
Men wanna be quarantined from unattractive girls.
We place so much emphasis on physical beauty... we' re afraid to be infected by one of these girls' inner beauty.
Let' s not have a pity party.
Please, you' re blocking my light.
Thanks for getting us the Lifetime channel, Matthew.
No problem.
Just don' t tell anybody I pirated.
It' s a felony.
Anybody up for a game?
How about you, Matt?
0r are you chicken?
Our grudge match escalated into a cold war of words.
Girls are just users.
Look at the praying mantis, for instance.
After they' re finished doing the nasty, the female eats the head...... of her male mate.
- I should expect a remark like that... from someone who thinks a car is an extension of his penis.
And a person is an extension of a woman' s vagina?
Score!
We aren' t filthy pigs like men.
We' re always picking after you.
Why are you so worked up?
PMS and quitting smoking at the same time?
A woman can' t get mad, unless it' s her period!
You' re so close- minded!
Yeah, but about all the right things.
Goal!
Two - zip.
Time to strip.
America is so one- sided.
Wedding gifts are a demonstration of that.
What all the newly- weds get?
Kitchen stuff.
Girlie crap.
Small trade- off for having to cook for some lazy ass man!
Lazy?
Then answer me this:
When you' re walking with a girl... why does the guy have to slow down, instead of her speeding up?
Who said going slower is better?
Going faster is better.
How about that?
Goal.
At least, we don' t start wars.
Maybe if we got laid a little bit more often, we wouldn' t be so.
Maybe you' d get laid more often, if you knew what you' re doing in bed.
You' ve got it easy.
You touch a guy anywhere and it feels good.
With a woman, it' s like finding a needle in a haystack.
While we' re on the subject, you find it gross to go down on a guy... and, when you do it, it' s like a really big deal!
But guys are willing to go diving for oysters anytime, anywhere.
We' re more willing to give pleasure, we' re less selfish.
At this remark, I thought Arlene would spontaneously combust.
- You' re so sexist!
- You know what?
I am.
- So are you.
- I am not!
You sound like Louis Farrakhan saying only white men are racist.
But we all have prejudices.
Black, white, male, female.
- Goal.
- You cheated!
How can you do that?
I wasn' t even looking!
My God, you cheated!
This was bad.
This wasn' t my glorious wrestling fancy.
- You cheated, admit it!
- We didn' t lay down any rules!
Maybe that was the problem.
There were no rules between men and women.
We had giant steels takes for a heart and we' re spinning out of control.
I was just as bad as Rod.
But I finally had something to say... when I was called on in my Woman Studies class.
There' s no clear defined rules between men and women.
Each side thinks they' re playing fair and they' re being cheated.
Maybe this is why men and women bring out the poison in one another.
Rubbish!
We all know there are rules!
Rules that are enforced and imposed by the contemporary patriarchy... of western civilization!
Saturday after midterms seemed like an ordinary Saturday night.
I checked on the girl who never came out of her room.
Then I noticed that Dora wasn' t in her usual spot.
Dora!
Have you girls seen Dora?
Have you guys seen Dora?
She' s up there.
- Why aren' t you doing anything?
- She does this every semester.
Id break the VCRs o those girls couldn' t watch Jane Austen movies.
Let' s play West.
0ne more flight.
Don' t do it!
The first time I did this, nobody noticed.
- Now nobody cares.
- I care.
Why are you doing this?
- I was born with the greatest curse.
- What' s that?
I' m ugly and I' m also very smart.
- You' re not ugly.
- I know what' s in store for me.
No one will ever have passion for me.
People all around me will be falling in love and making love... and getting married and having kids.
The closest thing I' il ever have to that... is someone inviting me to their Christmas dinner... because they feel guilty, I might be spending the holiday alone.
0r, if I' m lucky, my male counterpart... an obese man or a guy with a harelip, will invite me to coffee... and we' il pretend to love each other and tighten up... because we' re so desperately afraid of growing old alone.
I had a bad feeling this girl might jump this time.
I felt terrible that I had treated her like she had the Ebola virus.
There was something inside this girl I wanted to expose myself to.
She was so self- aware, so sensitive.
Maybe she noticed the change in me.
Come on, let' s go back inside.
0nly if you admit that I' m right.
You' re probably right.
You didn' t have to worry.
I just like to come up here sometimes and see what it might be like.
I found out what Dora was reading all those Saturday nights.
D. H. Lawrence, Colette and Henry Miller.
"Sylvester, yes, he knows how to build a fire.
But I know how to inflame your cunt.
I shoot hot bolts into you, Tania.
I make your ovaries incandescent ".
Can you imagine someone being that passionate for you?
Your turn.
"Your Sylvester is a little jealous now.
He feels something, doesn' t he?
The reminiscence of my big prick.
I set the shores a little wider.
I ironed out the wrinkles.
After me, you can take on stallions, bulls, rams... saint bernards ".
Being Francesca has its disadvantages.
What happened?
Last night, my roommate, Rod, came to find me.
He didn' t recognize me as Francesca.
God!
Jesus Christ!
So he starts looking at my dress.
I know exactly what he' s doing.
Because I do it when I can too.
Whenever men look at a girl, they imagine her naked.
So that' s what he' s doing to me right there.
- I know the feeling.
It' s no wonder that women have to be the gatekeepers of sex.
With the way men are, women could initiate the sexual battle... whenever they wanted.
Guys are just simply always willing to volunteer for sex.
Their attitude towards it, it' s like putting jam into a jelly donut.
I tested the concept with Rod.
So what do you wanna do about it?
What are you talking about?
You just said "I love you".
I said "olive soup".
- What?
- 0live soup.
So he was all ready to do it with you?
It proves men are irresponsible when it comes to genital gymnastics.
I have this theory that has to do with shopping.
- Shopping?
- Women have more practice at it.
They can go into a store, circle something and they won' t buy it!
They' re learning self- restraint.
Men only go shopping when we know exactly what we' re gonna get.
Men and women treat sex the exact same way.
- Your theory has some validity.
- It' s not only sex.
Women are more responsible about everything!
The fact of the matter is, women really rule the world.
Thank you.
The irony is that women are not pointed to recognizable positions.
They have to carry out their work at the underground.
Men are afraid of putting women to the work place, because they know... women will rise to their proper levels on top.
- I think you' re right.
- I' ve got a cookie for you here.
Thank you.
Care to come in and share a bowl of Captain Crunch?
Patty had a way of even making "Captain Crunch" sound sexy.
No, I have work to do.
Look, don' t be afraid.
I know you like some other girl than me.
Here, have some.
It' s the original.
That' s how I like it.
How do you know I like some other girl?
- By the way that you look at me.
- And how is that?
There' s a certain way a man stares at the woman he loves.
The man looks like a boy on his birthday.
And he treats the woman as if she were a gift... that he' s waited so long to open... and now he can' t wait to see what the treasure is inside.
You don' t give me that look.
You know how Captain Hook could always hear the crocodile... from the tic- tac of his clock in the crock' s belly?
That' s the way it was for me with Crick and his nicotine gum.
- I knew I' d find you two together.
- He was all high on nicotine gum.
I had to get Patty out of there.
The best way to do that was to focus his testosterone on me.
You know something, Crick, I was wondering.
The bad guys of the world really know they' re being bad... or they think they' re good guys when they act like sphincters?
I don' t know.
You tell me, smart guy.
- So you think you' re a good guy?
- I know I am.
You' re the one who' s trying to steal my chick.
I' m the cool one.
Cool?
That' s another thing that bothers me.
I was just reading that one in six people think they' re cool.
What is that like?
A billion people are cool?
That just can' t be right!
If everybody is cool, then really nobody is cool.
You don' t know what you' re talking about.
Look at you.
The modern- day media, the magazines, the TV... they show us what coolness is, so that you pony- tale pretenders... can go out there and buy coolness, thus fooling the weak- minded.
I had enough of you, buddy!
Get off me!
lonely had one desperate chance.
Bastard!
Get the hell off me!
Bastard!
What the fuck!
I think we ditched him.
Patty!
- What was that?
- My pinball balls.
- You had them in while eating?
- Yeah, it' s incredible.
There you are!
I was a dead man.
But then fate intervened.
After Crick hobbled away in pain, we were still drunk with laughter.
I guess that' s what made me do it.
Patty came on to me again, and succumbed.
I tried to rationalize.
I thought maybe I could learn from her... maybe this is why God made women like this... so that sexually impaired like me would' ve someone to practice on.
At this moment, she wasn' t a slut.
She was a luscious voice of experience.
Sweet leaping Jesus!
I figured that nobody on their deathbed looks back and says:
"I wish I had made love less".
We didn' t make love the way they do it in the movies... where the guy slides in between her legs like a hot knife through butter.
No, this was like real life.
No, not that hole.
I can' t get in.
You' re sure there' s not another ball in there?
No, here.
Let me help you.
No, we didn' t make cinema love.
We made the kind of love where you just laugh together... when bodies make that noise when air gets trapped in between you.
Patty taught me things.
You don' t have to kiss me the whole time.
Seems like you' re kissing me just to avoid looking at me.
Look into my eyes.
Concentrate on me.
Concentrate on us.
Id only done it twice, but now I knew why men love sex so much.
Because while you' re doing it, you feel like you' re as good... if not better than every other man.
The feeling of that grease makes you sure you' re in the correct path.
Madonna mia!
That everything is right in the world.
Our transcendent fusion was not the romantic type, it was just fun.
My experience with her was not serious and nothing cosmic.
I used her.
- I feel terrible.
- Don' t worry about it.
Did I tell you I' m up to 15 pounds over here?
I treated her like she was my sexual training wheels... something I' d use to learn and I' d discard when I no longer need them.
And what if the elevator girl finds out?
She' s gonna think I' m a dick.
Man, it' s your manifest destiny to nail her. in every species, it' s the male function to perpetuate its line.
You should embrace your destiny, not deny it.
How are you gonna get by with this attitude towards women, Rod?
I' m gonna get rich.
I' il give me one of those low- life whores... give her a nice car, a bunch of credit cards, lots of cash. in return, she' il take care of the kids and give me sex on demand.
What' s your problem?
What happened to make you hate women so much?
- There' s no problem.
- Something had happened.
I knew it.
There was definitely a horror in Rod' s past.
And it was the encounter with the monster that Rod called "woman".
- What' s your horror story?
- There' s no story, man.
You' re the one that' s got a problem with women, not me.
Maybe if you tried this thing, you wouldn' t be so nervous all the time.
Not only have my length and girth increased, but so has my virility, baby.
Just the other day, I boned this girl all night long.
Yeah?
What girl?
Francesca.
- Yeah, right!
She' s doable.
I' m telling you!
We had sex all night long.
She may be ugly, but I ain' t complaining.
I' m shepherd happy.
God, I hate guys
Dick!
More than half of the semester had passed, my debutante of the dark... my doll of destiny, hadn' t presented herself.
I had almost lost all hope when something happened.
- Matthew?
- You' re here!
My God, you know my name!
That' s wonderful!
- Stop trying to find me.
- What?
I don' t want you to find me.
- Can we talk about this for a second?
- There' s nothing to talk about.
I don' t like you.
Wait, can you...
Wait, hey, wait!
I chased her like I was Popeye Doyle chasing that train.
Got you!
I lost her.
- Do you wanna talk about it?
- No, I' m okay.
My anti- intimacy force field was on the autopilot.
Come on, might make you feel better.
I was feeling so bad, I decided to put the anti- intimacy on manual.
- I lowered it.
- Tell me about it.
I figured she had a boyfriend... or she was drunk that night and she didn' t remember.
0r I deluded myself into thinking she thought I was some pre- med... or pre- law Adonis, and that wouldn' t care when I found her.
I never thought it was because she didn' t like me.
- Maybe there' s another reason.
- I don' t think so.
I should' ve figured it had something to do with me.
Testosterone must really fill the ego, because...
I' ve stored plenty of both.
I' m just a big steaming pile of loser.
What do you think I am?
It' s midnight and I' m cleaning my room.
- Is your mom coming tomorrow?
- Yeah, you guessed it.
How do you get along with your folks? in 9th grade, I wanted to read these James Bond novels.
My mom wouldn' t allow it, unless my father cut out the sex scenes.
And certainly not to me.
I had to get glasses.
I begged my mom to let me get contact lenses.
"lf I get glasses, mom, I couldn' t be handsome like James Bond".
She just never let me feel like I could be sexy.
- I still feel that way.
- God!
Parents always try to turn us into something we don' t wanna be!
I wish I could be more than my parents' perfect little girl.
That looks like fun.
Wait.
0nly I' m allowed to.
- Now we' re even.
- Really?
Hi, mom.
This is Matt.
Finals were nearing, and so was the end of the school year.
I was running out of time.
Look what it did to my "Pride and Prejudice" tape.
This is a catastrophe!
I had one last chance, one last strategy.
If I improved myself, doing more than keeping my nails clean... maybe my cosmetic destiny might change her opinion of me.
She was out there somewhere watching me.
I decided, the first step in my taking a scouring to my soul...... was peace in the gender war.
- Another point, pussies?
- Forget it.
I' m outta here.
- Come on, just one more game!
I' il play.
I was a maze by how well Arlene and I complemented each other.
Arlene had a soft touch, knowing just where to set me up.
She let my power game do its magic.
She was an excellent cheer- leader.
She never got pissed when I blew a point.
It' s okay, you' re doing good.
You get it next time.
My balls and her energy drove us to new performance heights.
Come on, Arlene, smoke them!
Our masculine and feminine sides brought up the best in each other.
Potato chips and soda.
Men and women.
Because Crick and his buddy had the same styles, they often collided.
They were missing something.
They had the power, but no strategy.
There was too much ego.
They spent more time fighting each other.
You keep your arm on your side!
- That' s game, guys.
- End match.
Now drop them.
You cheated!
Let' s see those trophies, boys.
Let' s see them.
Girls, it' s just because it' s cold in here.
It' s freezing, I swear.
I know sometimes you think guys like me can be pigs.
I get sensitive sometimes.
Comes from growing up with 6 brothers.
I know, but I wanna tell you something.
It' s hard for me sometimes to figure out how to be a man.
What do you mean?
I can blame my father a little bit.
My male role model.
My dad loves ice- cream so much, he' d do anything to get it.
More than once, ld watch him running out in the middle of the street... in his underwear, after the ice- cream truck.
How is that supposed to teach me to be a man, right?
Back in the day, boys would go out with their fathers to work... or they' d take the weekend and go hunting.
At their fathers' sides, boys learn to be men. in the computer age, boys are at home and fathers, at the offices.
There' s no more apprenticeships left.
It leaves me in the street, looking at my father... is his under weareating ice- cream sandwich.
- Some role model.
- Right!
If I can' t grasp what a man is, how am I gonna understand women?
You understand women better than most men.
Thank you.
I love women.
I love those emerald pools masquerading as eyes.
Lips.
I love smiles... and the yawns.
The eating.
With skin so soft, women are head to toe cashmere.
A woman skin inspires a man' s fingers to have Magellan' s love of exploration.
It' s women' s bellies that drive me wild.
It' s more than the only part of the body you easily see naked.
The belly hints at the pleasures beyond.
You' re so near and yet so far.
Everything about a woman draws you to her sexuality.
The small triangle between her legs is like the head o fan arrow... which points, "Go here!"
Or if you follow the graceful line of the pectoral is major... it inevitably draws your eyes to the golden orbs... climaxed by the nipple.
God is in the details.
And the nipple is His greatest detail.
Dora loved the video I made of her.
I said 95% of directing is casting.
See?
You' re beautiful.
So, Cynthia, why aren' t you out on a Saturday night?
Because my face got flattened like road kill after the couch fell on me.
Sorry.
It was weird that I felt comfortable talking to her now... that her looks didn' t distract me.
She was the same girl, really.
- So what are you reading?
- "World Religion and Us".
This guy was supposed to give me his notes, but he never called me.
I was reading about these religious scholars who found out that... the phrase "walking in the water" meant "walking by the water". isn' t that interesting?
Perhaps Jesus didn' t perform any miracle.
We thought he did, because we made a mistake in the translations.
I hear you.
But you know what' s really messed up?
God loves us, right?
Then why does he let bad things happen to good people?
I don' t know.
I guess God has a plan for everybody, right?
His plan for me sucks!
You' ve got strong legs.
Id been avoiding Patty for a while.
I didn' t know how to handle it.
But I was thinking about her.
So Francesca went to hangout with her.
So what do you think about that maintenance guy Matt?
- He' s not my type really.
- Why is that?
I don' t know.
He just sort of seems distracted to me.
It was then that I heard the cracking of Crick' s nicotine gum.
Patty, I just heard of what you' ve been doing with Mr. Fix- it.
- Can we talk about this later?
- No, we' il talk about it right now!
- Please, just let go off me!
- Let her go!
You want to some of me too?
It looks like it' s just the two of us.
Relax, and we' il get along just fine.
Are you a slut too?
Everything will be fine.
Just relax.
Crick was chewing his nicotine gum in year.
All that went through my mind was what Crick had in store for me.
Do you like it?
I' m gonna give it to you good.
Now give us a
I hear you' re having troubles.
Look at you.
You wanna change your life so you come to hear the story.
High school popularity ain' t a contest, i\ x9Ds a war.
Dizzy Harrison is its greatest casualty.
See, his story is really my story.
Because behind every so- called hero...... is a little pissed off dude that don' t get no credit!
We have to go back a ways.
Even as a small child, Dizzy Harrison had his own particular style.
As you can see, I didn' t have a lot to work with.
I hurt myself!
Things didn' t get any better from there.
As the years went by, he got taller, whiter, skinnier.
First day, senior year.
And we' re gonna be the top dogs.
I wish I' d drowned this summer.
We all do, Kirk.
We' il always be Blips.
Blips?
We' re barely on the radar!
Not this year.
We' re seniors now.
I' m with Dizzy on this one.
I\ x9Ds never too late to make a change.
Full metal jacket.
Dad, put those away!
You' re such a dork!
I say we bail.
Home schooling?
My dad could teach drinking.
Nobody bails, bands stick together.
Guys, relax.
Music has the power to transform.
There' s some pain.
Good luck, son!
Yo, Blip?
Little help?
I' il never get used to that.
Can anyone help me?
Get out of the way!
You' re not going to talk to her.
That is Tina Ass- good, man!
Like a wood elf versus Al' Kabor.
You' il get power leveled!
We' re not playing EverQuest, we' re on earth.
Speak for yourself.
I' m going in.
Take that.
I know I can do this.
Tina!
You are?
Dizzy.
You gonna help me, or what?
Yeah!
You got to know your...
I\ x9Ds very technical.
A Blip is talking to Tina Osgood.
Look at my boy!
Didn' t they tie you up last year and make you wear rubber breasts?
You remember!
Tha\ x9Ds really sweet.
I imagine God having an ass like that.
Did that sound gay?
I' ve been thinking, we' re seniors now...... and maybe sometime, if you wanted to drink coffee...... near me...... l would pay.
Truthfully?
Yeah?
Type.
You know those moments when a man makes...... a decision tha\ x9Dil change his life...... and he steps up to become the hero he was meant to be?
This ain' t one of those moments.
I thought about this type thing.
To be honest, you' re not my type either.
Did you think tha\ x9Dd work?
No, but I thought it was worth giving it a shot.
You know something?
Yo, freak!
What are you doing?
Talking.
Innocent conversation.
Innocent?
Then wha\ x9Ds this?
Oh, my God!
Tha\ x9Ds disgusting!
Loser, nice pup tent!
We need to cover you up.
What is this?
Mrs. Whitman!
I\ x9Ds my...
I\ x9Ds mine now!
Is this a weapon?
You can' t bring loaded weapons to school!
You' re tearing the skin!
My deal!
I' m showing this to Principal Zaylor.
Cut it out!
I know what you' re thinking.
I\ x9Ds not medically possible.
But let me ask you this.
Are you a doctor?
I have good news.
Your son' s condition is treatable.
What condition?
The fact that I can pee around a corner?
Watch your mouth.
He can' t help it.
Wha\ x9Ds wrong with Dizzy, in medical terms...... i\ x9Ds called Tourette' s syndrome.
Tourette' s syndrome?
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Language, son.
You won' t cure him with force, Papa Bear.
I\ x9Ds going to take a lot of hugs and a lot of drugs.
Only take one of these a day.
Nice pack.
There he is.
Diz?
They gave me these pills for my Tourette' s, but they' re not working.
Come on, i\ x9Ds not that bad.
Not that bad?
At least as Blips...... we were invisible.
You break your dick in front of the whole school...... people remember that.
His life is ruined.
I mean, I' m an idiot.
I' il never be able to go back to school again.
I need more of these pills.
How can you be depressed with all this beautiful church music playing?
Yes, yes, yes!
Thank you, brothers and sisters of the Sunshine Gospel Choir.
Very stirring.
Very hip.
Amen!
Yes, yes, yes.
Now, do the rest of you young people know what else is hip?
Sexual abstinence.
Can I get an amen on that?
Amen!
Glory hallelujah!
Glory hallelujah!
I said, glory hallelujah!
Glory hallelujah!
Glory hallelujah!
Ladies and gentlemen...... brothers and sisters...... I' d like to talk to you all about sex!
The devil' s middle name, sex!
Amen!
Do you know what the best form of sexual abstinence is?
Being me.
Can I get an amen?
Amen!
Do you wanna talk about some pain?
Let me hear you!
That boy' s got the spirit!
He' s an idiot!
Has a member of the opposite sex ever told you you' re not her type?
Let me hear you shout amen...... if you ever had duct tape ripped off your naked buttocks!
Let me hear you shout amen if you ever had your manhood right- angled...... in front of the entire congregation!
Now let me hear you shout amen up high.
Amen!
Let me hear you shout amen!
He needed guidance.
He' s about to get a lesson in bad, from the best in the business.
What happened to Paco?
I got no answer to that question.
Back up.
The new man is mine.
Not the crazy eyes, Luther.
I was just messing.
Been looking at my Janet?
No.
No way.
Eighteen years and 41 days, i\ x9Ds me and you, baby.
Okay, I' m scared.
Guard?
Relax, white boy.
Wha\ x9Dd you do to get in here?
I' m not really sure.
I' ve been heavily medicated lately...... and the last thing that I remember is my dad dropping me off at school.
You in high school?
Yes.
I still get chills thinking about it.
Fish sticks!
I' ve officially become the biggest loser at my school.
I don' t think I' il be going back there.
I\ x9Ds okay.
I know what you mean.
I see that.
I was the bitch at the last prison!
I remember, they strapped me to a chair with duct tape...... in a dress.
With makeup?
And fake rubber breasts.
Rubber breasts!
My brother...... come on over here and sit down.
A high school...... i\ x9Ds a lot like prison.
Bad food, high fences.
The sex you want, you ain' t getting.
The sex you getting...... you don' t want.
I seen terrible things.
Yesterday, an 80- year- old librarian broke my penis.
You win.
How did you change things?
I got myself thrown out of the last prison and I started fresh here.
That worked?
Watch this.
Wow!
Tha\ x9Ds what I gotta do.
Switch prisons and start over.
You gotta tell me what you did to get kicked out.
The first thing I did...... is broke all the rules.
I can break all the rules.
Then I started acting crazy.
I can act all crazy.
I grabbed a broken mop handle and snapped it across the warden' s butt.
I don' t have to do this alone.
Le\ x9Ds all get expelled together.
Tha\ x9Ds okay.
You can go.
What about you, Glen?
No, I talk big, but I' m not as tough as I look.
Okay, here we go.
What are you thinking, Mr. Harrison?
You know, you' re right.
What am I thinking?
Everybody, the answer to number 23 is Guam.
Thanks, Broke- wood.
Mr. Luberoff?
Plenty more where this came from at finals time.
My Lord, Dizzy!
Cheating, bribery?
Those are grounds for expulsion!
Or an obvious cry for help.
Wha\ x9Ds Broke- wood doing?
Tha\ x9Ds Principal Zaylor!
You' re a fighter!
Try this!
Shit it!
Shit it!
Say mercy!
You' re almost at the head of the class!
And, cut!
This is the part of my job I hate.
Expelling people?
No, silly.
We' re going to double your medication...... increase your therapy, and you may have to stay another year.
Loser, how' s it hanging?
That toilet- cam was your best work ever.
Looks like I' m stuck here for the rest of my life.
Or am I?
Hey!
Hey!
What are you doing?
Halt!
Did you just break that mop?
Give me that!
Yes!
I did it.
I busted out.
I knew you had it in you.
Ready to be Luthercized?
Preach, my brother!
I' m gonna take you from bitch to bull.
You wanna get a reputation at your new school...... you' il have to crack open heads, day one.
Find the biggest, baddest cat and whup his ass!
Make sure everybody sees him go down.
Everybody sees him go down.
Got it.
You know, some people are born with that knowledge.
Like Barclay.
Who' s Barclay?
He' s the bully at my last school.
He might be born with it but with my insights, street smarts...... and knowledge of every action movie, we' re gonna perfect it.
Happens every day.
Same cat.
Never gets away.
Come on.
First thing you do is gouge the dude' s eyes out so he can' t see to fight.
Hey, this kiïs in high school.
Then you' re going to want to fight dirty.
All right, set your feet.
Spread your palms.
Tiger Claw!
Are you sure i\ x9Ds not Tiger Paw?
Tiger Claw!
Now you' re ready!
Just watch my hands.
Grab some rope.
You gotta build some muscle.
You act like you can' t get up there.
Motivation is on the way.
Yes, indeedy, feed the needy.
There you go!
Luther, what are you doing?
Get up there!
Tha\ x9Ds it.
Wha\ x9Ds that burning?
I\ x9Ds me!
Just roll around.
You' il be all right.
If you can' t act tough, you gotta look tough.
Butch up, girlie- pants!
Got a sec?
What?
Phone call for you, warden.
My wife again?
I' il never get tired of that.
You talk the talk, you gotta walk the walk.
Otherwise, you' il be lined in chalk.
Let me introduce you to somebody.
The Funkmaster.
Somebody, give me a beat!
Them crazy eyes?
Like someone hits you in the head and your eyes almost jump out your skull!
Try it!
This is the "Brother, where my money" walk.
Where it at?
About to bust a cap.
About to bust a cap.
Flare your nostril up!
You gotta open them up.
So everybody can see the rocks, the boogers up in there.
Loosen the ass.
Tha\ x9Ds too loose.
They' il play you like a bitch, you gotta hit them with the bitch first!
Like, "Who' s the bitch now?"
Watch this.
Try it.
Try it!
Who' s the bitch now?
Half Brad Pitt Fight Club, half Anne Heche if These Walls Could Talk.
For your student I. D.
Your new driver' s license.
This one' s for the Player' s Club.
That ain' t right.
Really cock it!
You know what I' m saying?
Fire!
Cock it!
Shoot the gun!
Shoot the gun!
Tiger Claw!
Dude, pretty nice.
Now you ready for your new prison.
Mascot, you dropped your bagpipe.
Thank you.
Suck on that, pal!
Tuba midget!
Have a nice day!
This place is a zoo!
He did say 12: 30.
So where is he?
What the hell is that?
Good luck, kid.
Flip him!
Back in the truck!
Is that...... Diz?
Oh, my God!
He' s got kind of a...... Brad Pitt thing going there.
From bitch to bull, baby.
I saw a little Anne Heche there too.
Does that sound gay?
"Find the biggest, baddest mother in the yard, and knock his ass out."
Lift your knees, maggots!
Maybe we' il win one sorry- ass game this year!
I' m gonna puke.
Use it.
Keep looking at the horse' s ass and run!
Biggest and baddest.
More cheer, less pole dance.
Don' t want guys stuffing bills down your panties.
What panties?
Don' t I have a dreamy boyfriend?
Make sure everybody sees him go down.
Careful.
You mind if I sit down?
Wrong level, bitch.
Bitch, say what?
I think we got a serious problem here.
If i\ x9Ds you, there' s no prob...
Dude, wha\ x9Ds with you?
Who' s the bitch now?
You guys might want to come scoop up your friend.
Shit!
Oh, God!
What are you doing?
Knocking you into the hall and me into the history books.
Who' s the bitch now?
You' ve gotta be kidding me!
Don' t go that way.
Help!
Who' s the bitch now?
Coming through!
Look out!
Coming through!
Take your hat off in school!
Le\ x9Ds have a round of applause for Conner Maguire.
Everyone?
Come on.
Everyone?
You!
Come on.
Don' t be shy!
Stop it, all of you!
Hello, son.
I told you last time, you start something, you' re what?
You' re gone!
Well, my friend, looks like i\ x9Ds last call.
Last call?
He didn' t start it.
I did.
Who the hell are you?
I' m the new guy.
How' s the nose?
Shut up!
Look at that freak, sitting on top of the tower.
Move!
We should unroll the welcome mat.
I' ve dreamed of dating the expelled guy.
Expelled guys rock!
Later.
Later.
You' re not going over there.
I wasn' t.
Now I am.
Later.
She just dissed you.
Dude, shut up!
Hey, new guy.
Got a name?
Harris, Gil Harris.
I' m Courtney, tha\ x9Ds Carmen, tha\ x9Ds Danielle.
How do you like our little slice of paradise?
I gotta tell you...... i\ x9Ds nice to be somewhere without bars.
You were in jail?
Did they give you a full body cavity search?
They get shy around strangers.
My fault, I talk too much.
Tha\ x9Ds hot.
There' s a party tonight at my house, if you can come.
I don' t make plans.
Not my style.
We love you, Rocky Creek!
We' re here all week!
We love Texas and we love you too!
So I' m guessing it went well?
In 10 minutes, the first 18 years of my life completely changed.
They bought it?
Things have changed.
You made it to the 50th level of Kunark.
Better.
I got invited to a party.
Dizzy Gillespie Harrison.
Excuse me while I do the bugaloo!
Whoa, slow down, funky white boy.
Did they invite you, or Gil Harris?
Listen, the point is nobody stuffed me in my locker or singed off my ass hair.
Please.
No offense.
Are you saying these chicks party on a school night?
Courtney does.
That is without doubt the sluttiest girl I have ever seen!
Isn' t it great?
You have to do her.
And while you' re with her, think of me.
Okay, that sounded gay.
Courtney is expecting Gil at the party tonight.
She' s right, how would Gil Harris party?
The question is, how would Gil get jiggy with this chick...... and make her say, "Who' s your daddy?"
While respecting her as a woman.
Diz, you ready for this?
My dad loves this bike more than me.
Tha\ x9Ds not true.
No, it is.
He wrote it in my birthday card.
So please be very careful.
This is a vintage flat track racing bike.
I\ x9Ds very powerful.
You have to know what you' re doing.
Stand back.
I' il start it for you.
Remember, I won' t always be around to do that for you.
Courtney got Tony Hawk to come to her party?
There' s nothing cooler than that!
That dude' s crazy.
Hey, man!
These are Dockers!
I made it.
Bush!
Hey!
Courtney, you see that Indy 360?
Tony, please.
Randy, did you see that Indy Three?
I could do it again.
Have any trouble finding the house?
Well, aren' t you the strong, silent type?
Well, I...
Wanna come upstairs with me?
Wanna make out with me?
Wanna take my clothes off with your teeth?
Okay, you talked me into it.
Aren' t you coming?
Almost.
Courtney is such a slut.
You dated her for two months.
It was four.
Hey, new guy.
You wanna dance, new guy?
Know why I like it out here?
The view?
No, because of all these people around.
Doesn' t it turn you on, knowing we could be caught at any moment?
Yeah, well, that does make things interesting.
Wanna make out?
Okay.
I forgot something.
Ready for dessert?
Gil?
Hello?
Wha\ x9Ds the matter?
I can' t believe it.
What happened?
Gil blew me off.
Sucks to be you.
Carmen, put it away.
Honey, I knew that boy was trouble.
I know what you' re thinking, "He' s too good- looking for me."? Hola, habla inglés?
Hello!
Where' d you come from?
Exercising.
Got a problem?
No, i\ x9Ds cool.
What does that hit: lats, tris, bis?
These are bat- curls, for the abs.
Cool!
Did you really blow off Courtney?
You can tell us.
You blow her off?
I didn' t exactly blow her off.
Stop right there.
Any dude who disses Courtney must date the most outrageous women on earth!
Hey, what can I say?
"What can I say?" You are the man!
You are the man!
I say you' re a fraud.
I don' t think you' ve been with anyone.
Yeah, you' re right.
She' s not just anyone.
This babe' s got it all!
Yes, she does.
I bet she knows how to make a guy happy!
I' d love to stay and chat...... but Josefina' s waiting for me.
You' re not going anywhere.
Don' t make me do crazy eyes.
Josefina.
Exotic!! Me gusta Josefina!
Guys!
Don' t you see wha\ x9Ds going on here?
Yeah, to get chicks, we gotta work on our abs!
Le\ x9Ds go.
Come on!
Come on, up.
Ready?
One, two...
I got it!
Check me out, baby!
Bat- wings!
Hey, chump change, get down!
Bat- wings, baby!
Watch, everyone!
That bike won' t even start.
He trashed it when he landed.
Please start.
I\ x9Ds a full- time job trying to save his butt.
I almost got laid!
Did he say, "brake"?
I almost got laid!
Waiting up for me?
Yes, we are.
We?
Hi.
Hey.
Dad, what is Miss Pierce doing here?
Kiki' s here to help.
With what?
An intervention.
We' re surrounding you with love.
Now sit.
Okay.
Dramatic change in appearance, lack of communication...... altered patterns of behavior.
Wha\ x9Dre you on?
Is it crystal meth?
Is it the crank?
Are you riding the white pony, son?
I' m happy.
For the first time in I can' t remember when, I' m happy.
It occurs to me to tell you that denial is not just a river in Egypt!
Look, son, i\ x9Ds all my fault.
I was so worried about alarms going off at work I missed the ones at home.
I' il make it up to you.
I' m quitting my job so we can be together 24/ 7.
How will you pay the mortgage?
I' il sell the house.
Dad, do not, I repeat, do not do that.
There' s no way for you to understand this.
But when things get truly bad...... you got to make a drastic change.
Completely revamp everything in your life to get what you want.
I do understand.
I' m not sick.
I' m revamped!
I\ x9Ds very sweet.
Underneath the Tourette' s and the crank...... he still wants to be like his daddy.
I' m so on to you.
You are?
You pretend you' re not part of this school, but you like being a badass.
You caught me.
And tha\ x9Ds why I want to use you.
Okay, but only for a couple of years.
Come to the football game this weekend.
Nobody shows.
I\ x9Ds more acceptable to drink and puke than it is to watch a game.
I\ x9Ds hard work, not caring.
If you show up, maybe some of these other fools would.
I' m in.
What?
My grandmother' s Albanian.
It means, I owe you one.
Wha\ x9Ds that about?
Just asking the new guy a favor.
What could you need from him?
Just things I' m not getting elsewhere.
Come on, East Highlands!
Okay, ready?
Danielle finally dragged you to a game.
I' m not at the game, I' m with you guys.
I just like to watch her jump around.
Yeah, right!
Ride him, cowboy!
Will you shut up?
Man, tha\ x9Ds not funny.
Come on, East Highland!
Come on, people.
Guys?
Hello?
One.
One, two, three.
Two.
One, two, three.
This is bullshit!
We haven' t won in five years.
Le\ x9Ds forfeit.
We' re dead anyway.
Ten, hut!
He' s out of his mind.
Dead?
Did you say dead?
All this hoo- hah about being dead and not wanting to fight...... is a load of crap!
Did we give up when Pearl Harbor was bombed?
Didn' t that movie make money?
We didn' t give up then, and we' re not going to give up now!
American high school students traditionally love to fight!
All real football players love the sting of battle!
The only thing we have to fear is...... fear itself.
What is wrong with you people?
Where' s the hunger?
Where is the school spirit?
Washington High?
We' re gonna beat them!
Lincoln High?
We' re gonna beat them!
Harding High?
We' re gonna beat them.
Yes!
Le\ x9Ds do it.
Le\ x9Ds do it!
Tha\ x9Ds my goddamn horse!
Hit them high, hit them low!
Break!
Yes!
Touchdown!
Touchdown!
How about that, Highlander fans?
Tha\ x9Ds our first victory since the last Bush was president.
We won a game!
Can you believe it?
We actually won a game!
Go Highland!
What the hell' s going on?
You' re insane, but thank you.
How' d you learn to say "you' re welcome"?
From an Albanian chat room.
You' re impressed by a guy on a horse?
No, because he showed up for me.
Le\ x9Ds go.
She just dissed you again.
Dude, do you ever shut up?
Most guys would never go shopping.
Well, I' m not most guys.
You did say swimsuits, right?
Thank you!
Sorry about that.
I been in prison a long time.
Now this is real music.
If I listen to this, I' il get you?
Tha\ x9Ds what I' m talking about.
All right.
Danielle, I didn' t see you come in.
Hey, Emily.
How' s it going?
Great.
How about you?
Great.
Hey, do you have the new Creed CD?
Yeah, I' il check for you.
Who' s that?
We used to be friends.
What happened?
I started dating Conner...... you know how things go.
I understand.
Come on, you' re not the type who' d drop your friends.
Time to go!
I' m shopping here!
You' ve been listening to this song for hours!
You' re squatting!
Listen, bro, I' ve had a bad day, so squat on this, pukeface!
Tha\ x9Ds it!
Seth, you' re not a bouncer anymore.
You' ve moved up.
Who can toss her better?
Would you relax?
Come on, I' m sick of this!
Diz, you made it!
Perfect timing.
I thought you never check the EQ message boards.
Gil, do you know these people?
No.
Le\ x9Ds go.
We' ve found a pair of balls.
Wait, there' s a name here.
Dizzy Harrison, pick up your balls and scrotum.
Tha\ x9Ds balls and scrotum, at counter five.
You know what?
I have all these.
Tha\ x9Ds my microphone!
Oh, no.
Please don' t!
Harris, get your punk ass in here!
What are you doing here?
You stole my horse, maggot!
You know the penalty in this state for stealing another man' s horse?
Death?
This isn' t Iraq, son.
But I can tell you, i\ x9Ds probably a hefty fine!
You know what this is?
I\ x9Ds a bill for manure clean up, resodding the football field.
To top it off, somebody urinated all over Mrs. Campanella' s rose garden.
That was me, sir.
And you wanna know something else?
It was all worth it!
Come here!
Come here!
That was our first victory in five years, and i\ x9Ds all because of you!
I love you more than my own good- for- nothing son.
Sit down, take a load off.
Right, coach?
You have any ideas on how we might turn this thing around?
Good music.
Music!
Hey.
That is a fantastic idea, son.
You see that?
Hey!
What kind of music?
The only music worth being called music.
I' m talking about the funk.
Hello, singing?
We can' t play funk without a bass line.
Or black guys.
We' il find someone.
We don' t need Ditz.
Oh, you don' t?
So somebody else is getting you paying gigs?
We headline at homecoming in two weeks.
Someone talking to us?
I don' t hear anything.
I\ x9Ds Diz.
Wha\ x9Ds wrong with you people?
I was an asshole at the mall.
World- class asshole.
They' re scouting me for Asshole Olympics.
I' m carrying the torch.
Come on, you guys, I' m sorry.
I got no good excuse for what I did.
I\ x9Ds not easy being the big bull.
You' re the big bullshit!
Gil' s the big bull.
Yeah, but tha\ x9Ds me.
Is it?
So, what makes you any different from any other high school thug?
Quit it!
It wasn' t me?
Then who was it?
Him.
Hi, guys.
Ed Ligget.
Tuba!
The marching band is collecting bottles for the homeless.
Ironically, taking away their only job.
Any donations would be appreciated.
You know what the homeless need?
A midget.
Why would they need a midget?
Shut up!
Hey!
Quit it!
What a throw.
Little Ed, are you okay?
Yeah, I' m from a rodeo family.
You remembered my name.
Come on.
Wha\ x9Ds Gil doing?
He' s taking him up the tower.
Ed Ligge\ x9Ds gonna get his little ass kicked.
Who' s that little dude?
Hey, Conner.
What did Ed ever do to you?
All right, freak.
We don' t call people that here.
Danielle?
She' s going down there with the geeks!
Emily.
Danielle.
Look, Emily...
I know.
You backed him instead of me?
Caught that?
Bullshit!
My girlfrienïs supposed to back me up!
You' re right.
Your girlfriend should back you up.
Find one.
I don' t need you!
I could have anyone!
Look, man.
I' m sorry me and the guys pissed in your tuba.
You did?
Yeah.
I thought it tasted funny.
Another win for the Highlanders!
Mark' s gonna help you pass trig.
You don' t remember me, do you?
"Stop!
Please!
Your ass is crushing my head! "
Oh!
Was that you?
Highland wins again!
Damn!
Tha\ x9Ds what I' m talking about!
I' d like to introduce you to a few old buddies of mine.
Hi, I' m...... Hawk.
And I' m...... Apache.
Were in prison together.
Mostly in the shower.
Can youjust smell the playoffs?
Before I met Gil, I' d have looked at you and walked away...... wiggling my ass to show what you missed.
Yeah, well, the universe is upside down.
And in a few minutes, you will be too.
I finally understand the song.
Touchdown!
Unbelievable!
We' re going to the State Championship!
The Highlanders are on fire!
Little spill.
Remember...... turn, don' t burn.
I want you to know that when you go off to college, me and this house...... roll with you.
Dad.
Do not, I repeat, do not do that!
Just roll around, Dad, you' il be all right.
We' re closed.
Hey, i\ x9Ds okay.
He' s with me.
You' re really good!
Best part of working here.
I ride the bull for free.
I get good tips for wearing a bandanna as a shirt.
Watch it, hoodlum.
Tha\ x9Ds Estelle.
She must like you.
Hi, Estelle.
Hi.
Don' t mind Estelle.
She' s like my big sister.
She worries.
What could she worry about?
That I' il end up like my mom.
Working days here and raising three kids by myself.
I didn' t know that.
I\ x9Ds hard to keep track of the white trash clichés.
I' m not worried.
You' re not?
Tha\ x9Ds a relief.
You want a pad?
For what?
Estelle!
Look.
If I can do what I' ve done, you can do anything.
I wish I had your confidence.
Don' t ever wish that.
Why?
You know exactly who you are.
But you don' t know who I am.
Before I came to East Highland...
You get good distance with the skinny ones.
Are you okay?
Tha\ x9Ds just it.
I' m not...
They killed Paco.
Paco?
Paco!
Black Spiders.
See this tattoo?
I don' t need to hear it.
There' s things about me I need to tell that you won' t like.
It doesn' t matter!
Anything in your past, I don' t need to know.
Le\ x9Ds just think about now.
But I' m really Dizzy.
So am I.
She is going to college, punk!
Hey, lady, nobody' s stopping her!
Tha\ x9Ds a buzz- kill.
Night, Estelle.
Ready for State Finals?
All I do is ride a horse.
I' m worried.
Those Drillers can be brutal.
The Drillers?
Rocky Creek High.
You know where it is?
I do.
Look, Danielle.
I can' t go to that game.
I hate that school.
Wait a minute.
How can you not come?
I\ x9Ds complicated.
I hate it too, but if you don' t show up, nobody will.
Please, don' t bail now.
Le\ x9Ds welcome our undefeated defending State Champions...... the Rocky Creek Drillers!
And from East Highland High...... the Highlanders.
I can' t believe those kilt- wearing wussies aren' t gonna show up.
Hold!
Wha\ x9Ds going on?
Kirk, you' re falling behind.
Go, go!
What a miraculous, momentous occasion in Highlander history, sports fans!
With eight ticks left on the clock, the score is tied, 24 all!
The Drillers are at the 50- yard line.
There' s only time for one lastplay!
lf the Highlanders can stop the Drillers, we' re looking at overtime!
Who' s that little dude?
Le\ x9Ds go, Highland!
Le\ x9Ds go, Highland!
This is the biggest day for Texas Five- A football...... since Johnson killed Kennedy!
Come on, Highland!
Highland!
Highland!
You understand wha\ x9Ds going on?
Their team isn' t killing us, their fans are!
Put your heads in the game and concentrate!
We got a split left quick toss, 29 on one- on- one.
Duncan gets the ball.
No way, asshole!
Not Duncan!
Just do your job, and I' il do the rest!
Watch the back!
Red, 71, down!
Go, Rocky Creek!
Get out of here, Rocky Creek!
Defense!
Defense!
Defense!
Fumble!
Go!
Highland wins!
This is for you, son.
Thank you.
Go Highland!
No!
Is that..?
Hi!
Hey, Dizzy dipshit!
Where are you?
Yo, dipshit!
How you doing, buddy?
How' s it going?
Who is he?
Just an old friend.
A friend of Gil is one of mine.
Travis.
Lonnie.
Pete.
How you doing, man?
Better now.
Wha\ x9Ds wrong with you?
So I tossed a freak.
We discourage name- calling here.
What do you want?
You stole my championship, asshole!
If you must talk like that, I' il have to ask you to leave.
I' il leave as soon as I tell the truth about your leader.
We know he was in prison.
Prison?
Are you shitting me?
All right, buddy- boy!
That doesn' t fly around...
Okay, you guys, back it up.
This is my fight.
Oh, baby!
Come on, make my day!
Get him!
I' m gonna go rodeo on your ass!
Take this!
And this!
I wanna know what you know.
Someone spread the word about our band.
That was us.
But half of Rocky Creek is here.
What?
How did they hear?
Hey, guys.
Check this out.
Creed?
What idiot would fall for this?
There' s a menu on the other side.
Anybody know where the VlP room is?
Excuse me, ladies?
Hello?
Thank you.
Who did that?
Hey, fat- ass.
Quiet, Billy.
Hi.
I didn' t think I' d live to see us win the State Championship.
Quiet!
Ladies and gentlemen...... Suburban Funk!
We can do this.
Ladies and gentlemen, Creed...
... will not be here tonight.
Repeat, will not be here.
And drop curtain.
Cue.
Mrs. Whitman, i\ x9Ds my...
No...
Yo, East Highland, you know Gil Harris.
Hey, Rocky Creek, you remember Diz Harrison?
Guess what, folks?
Gil and Diz are the same guy.
You don' t believe me, ask him yourself.
Maybe for once, he' il tell the truth.
This sucks!
Wha\ x9Ds going on?
Hey!
Nora, i\ x9Ds all right.
I can handle this.
I can explain.
Let the brother speak!
Luther.
Not just Luther.
Spiders.
You play my kind of music.
Out of the way, Red.
I' ve been in the pen a while.
Everything you saw on that screen was completely...... true.
They' re right.
I' m a liar.
I don' t know what I was thinking.
Actually, I do know what I was thinking.
I was trying to become something more than just a blip on the radar screen.
So I made someone up.
Someone I thought you' d all like.
And all because I cared more about what other people thought of me...... than what I thought of me.
But I bet I' m not the only person here who' s ever let that happen.
What is this?
Broke- dick, Broke- dick!
Broke- dick, Broke- dick!
Better come scoop up your friend.
Move it!
Anybody got a staple gun?
Who' s the bitch now?
Diz!
Oh, my God, you' re bleeding!
My nose.
The crowd, they' re animals!
No, animals are kinder.
They don' t boo when they' re killing something.
Diz, you are amazing.
What was that for?
Can' t I appreciate you?
You' re scaring me.
Wha\ x9Ds going on?
You' ve inspired me.
I have to do something I' ve wanted to do a long time.
I have to let somebody know how I feel about him.
You know, Nora...
Better than PlayStation 2?
Now it is.
Yo, I guess i\ x9Ds me and you.
And us.
And me.
Would you two get a room?
I' m sorry.
I don' t know what to call you.
Broke- dick seems to be popular.
You' re the biggest liar I' ve ever met.
You' re right, I' m a liar.
They called me "Dan the Man."
What?
That was before I lost the braces and grew boobs.
Then I became "Danielle the Body."
I dropped all the friends I had because they looked like the old me.
And very selfish and mean...... but I just wanted so badly to fit in.
Been there.
Do you even ride the motorcycle?
Yeah, actually I do.
But it usually takes a station wagon or a bush to stop me.
So, what do we do now?
Don' t ask me.
The last plan I had blew up pretty badly.
No kidding.
So you see...... I saved his narrow behind.
And he got to kiss the girl.
I hope that inspires you.
It has.
I\ x9Ds taught me a lot.
I\ x9Ds easy for a man like me to forget what most slobs will do to get a woman.
My fault, I talk too much.
That really did burn me, sorry.
Oh, God!
You okay?
No, he clipped it.
Tha\ x9Ds why I wanna use you.
You staring at my Janet?
No way, man!
Can we do that again?
He couldn' t understand what I said.
I' m sorry, that sucked!
Look at that!
Don' t yell for mercy.
Oh, God, I blew the line.
Check me out!
Bat- wings!
Cut!
Cut!
I need three gallons of mineral water...... 16 martini olives...... and enough hummus to cover this beautiful girl' s body.
You got that?
Who' s the bitch now?
Hey, man.
You got a smoke?
How you doing?
Better now.
Okay, cut.
Meanwhile the war has come to the kitchen.
Housewives are showing the enemy what they' re made of.
Who would have guessed that a turnip could go so far.
German pocket battleships, Scharnhorst and Gneisenau are still dodging the Allied bombing raids.
The Atlantic won' t be safe until they' re beneath the waves!
As the prime Minister boards one of our finest navel destroyers,
Winston Churchill thanks the boys who have been keeping our convoys safe.
Excuse me.
Lord Louis Mountbatten salutes his heroes home.
Following the bravery shown by his' Commandos',
Lord Louis shakes the hands of the men who have shaken Jerry rigid.
Their raid on the Western lsles of Norway has been a triumph of military strategy.
One grenade in the right place and bang goes another Jerry HQ!
So watch out, Adolf!
Who knows where our boys will strike next.
By the right, quick march.
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right,
Ieft, right...
Fighting a war means doing one' s job and in the field of battle, gentlemen, every second counts.
One mistake or miscalculation and the results can be catastrophic.
Let me tell you a story.
I was sitting in a shell hole, surrounded by the enemy, with not much left of the chap on my right.
The chap to the left was no better off.
Sitting beside me was a young soldier screaming in agony.
Never seen anything like it, rocking like a child, clutching his head, calling for his mother.
Believe me, gentlemen, toothache in the field is no joke.
Know what I did?
I made a stopper out of some brackish mud, a shell case from my 38 and a clove of garlic.
The chap was back in action in under two minutes and the enemy ran like buggery when they smelt him coming.
What we do here is frontline stuff.
You' ve all seen the RAF before and while they do their bit, we' il do ours with an impression tray, a clear head and Poly Pliers.
Let' s get started.
Three reasons why we use...
Move!.
.. wouldn' t you say, Cuthbertson?
- Sir?
- Your war effort is here, Private.
So let' s not waste any time, alright.
An army marches on its stomach, Cuthbertson and an army that can' t bite is an army that can' t fight.
What' s an army that can' t bite?
An army that can' t fight, sir.
Well, upward and onward, the use of china clay in the shade matching of dentures.
- Yeah.
Give us a hand. >
Here, is this your mug?
Look at the state of that.
That' s mould that is, mould! >
- You could grow mushrooms in that.
- Oh, just get on with it. >
Captain Cuthbertson to the rescue.
You saved us!
Cuthbertson!
What the bloody hell are you doing?
- Nothing, Sergeant.
- Don' t lie to me, soldier.
What the bloody hell is that?
It' s a hand grenade, Sergeant.
I know what it is, but what is it doing in your hand?
Er...
Give it to me.
I said give it to me, Private.
What do we do now?
- Will it go off?
- No.
Not while I' m holding the grip.
I' il go and get some help.
Wait!
Put the pin back in.
I can' t... it' s bent.
It' s meant to be bent.
I know that but this one' s bent bent.
It' s bloody cold in here.
Did you leave the door open? >
I' ve got an idea.
You better not break it.
Bugger!
I think I' ve broken it!
No, it' s alright.
We' ve got company.
Will it hold now I' ve bashed it?
Follow me!
- Where did that come from?
- Bloody nowhere, sir.
- Anyone hurt?
- Don' t know, sir.
Pick your feet up!
- What do you reckon?
- Looks like a thousand pounder.
No, this a fart in the bath compared to a thousand pounder.
That was a 550 lb bomb dropped from the port rack of a Junkers 88.
- How do you know that?
- I saw it.
(SHOUTS) Don' t just stand there gawping, start clearing it up now!
All accounted for, Regimental Sergeant Major, sir.
- Casualties?
- Nothing serious.
The Colonel' s wife swallowed a prune stone.
- Sir!
- Everybody alright?
Yes.
The colonel' s wife swallowed a prune stone, sir.
Bit of a mess! < Attention!
Stand easy.
Mmm.
Bit of a mess all this.
Any idea what it was?
Hut 29, sir.
- What dropped it?
- Junkers 88, sir.
Must have had one left over, sir.
So you don' t think they were aiming at us?
Point taken.
That was a bloody hand grenade.
You could have blown us all to bits and saved Adolf the bother!
Yes, Sergeant. < You would have been on the Pathe News then!
Yes, Sergeant.
Our services are not required except for... and exclusively for... the pulling of teeth.
Is that clear?
I just want to fight for my country, Sergeant.
Your country does not need you.
You' ve seen action, you know what it' s like.
All I want is a posting, Sergeant.
The army wants you to do what you' re told.
I joined up to fight.
You joined up to follow orders like the rest of us.
It' s what we do.
It' s known as' doing our bit '.
I don' t want to spend the rest of my war sat on my bum making dentures.
Get out.
Heard the news?
Mowat' s got the posting.
Congratulations.
Thank you, Sergeant.
I' il have a whisky.
Whisky.
Sorry, Sergeant.
Mess rules.
You' re out of credit.
Then make it a double.
So... they chose Mowat.
It was your... age apparently, not your experience.
On me, sir.
- Where are they sending him?
- Egypt, I believe.
It' s all hush- hush, like everything else that' s common knowledge.
My money was on you.
Looks like you' re here for the duration.
- Good luck.
- Cheers, mate.
- Why don' t you stay and join us?
- Why don' t you piss off.
Cheers!
(MUTTERS) Miserable bastard!
What time is it?
Main gate - five minutes.
Full battledress.
Move.
Here comes the Kaiser.
Poor little bugger.
Where are we going, Sergeant?
- Gun Hill and back?
- Station.
The station?
Halt.
Bring your knee up to your chest.
Give me your pay book.
What are you doing?
- Posting it.
- Who to?
The Prime Minister.
Come on.
We' il miss our train.
Where are we going?
If the mountain won' t come to Mohammed..... Mohammed must go to the mountain.
What mountain?
Cornwall then France.
I' ve got dental anatomy in an hour.
Fair enough.
Tell the CO your pay book is with Churchill, along with a letter explaining you' re off to invade France.
Invade France?
All aboard.
By the by, Private, in case you were wondering, you are Absent Without Leave as from now.
I hate dental anatomy.
Dear prime Minister, by the time you receive this letter we shall have landed safely on the coast of occupied France.
We will carry out a land- based assault on the port of Brest.
We aim to destroy the battleships, Scharnhorst and Gneisenau.
We are trained soldiers, proud to be in His Majesty' s service and willing to lose our lives for our country.
As proof of identity, we enclose our army pay books and conclude with the army dental corps regimental motto,
'Ex Dentibus...
Ensis'.
'From the teeth comes strength'.
We are your obedient servants, Sergeant peter King and private Leslie Cuthbertson.
J ust one grenade in the right place is all it takes.
Right in the belly of the ship.
Liners, destroyers, they' re all the same, oil- driven steam turbine.
One explosion, 'bang!', the whole bloody lot goes up.
I' m just going for a jimmy riddle.
This is the Queen Mary, Sergeant.
Pass and travel warrant, please.
Got a problem have we, Private?
No, Corporal.
Is this what you' re after, Corporal?
Private Cuthbertson.
Sergeant King.
- Where are you off to then?
- Plymouth.
- Weekend leave is it?
- Yes.
A Sergeant and a Private travelling together is unusual.
Is it, Corporal?
He' s my uncle.
We' re staying with my aunt..... his wife..... Linda.
Have a nice trip.
Leave the talking to me, alright?
- He believed it.
- That' s not the point.
Would you gentlemen be interested in a pair of silk stockings?
That' il be one and four.
Thank you.
I' ve thrown one in for good measure.
- Thanks very much.
- Bye.
- What are those?
- Supplies.
We don' t know when we' re going to eat next and it' s abroad.
- Do you want one now?
- No.
Stop waving those stockings about.
How long do you reckon we' re going to be?
Once we get a boat, four days.
What if the letter doesn' t get to Mr Churchill?
I sent a birthday card to my sister in Durham and it took six weeks.
She ain' t half a fibber though.
Bugger!
They' re not the only German battleships.
No.
We' il find other ones.
St Nazaire.
- What?
- South of Brest.
Full of U- boats.
U- boats, yeah, even better.
- Are you sure you don' t want one?
- No.
Look, we don' t want to do anything to draw attention to ourselves.
- Right.
Sorry.
- So put those in the bag.
I can' t they' re full... of something else.
Give them here then.
Left, right, left, right...
I' m running out of patience here.
I will not have deserters in my regiment.
We don' t know they are deserters. < I want these men found and punished.
I will not have this behaviour in a time of war.
I want you to find them and throw the book at them.
Is that clear?
- Sir.
Bloody side show.
What if we' re caught?
We' re in uniform.
We' il be prisoners of war.
Not by the Germans, by the English.
They' il already be looking for us.
Can I help?
We' re looking for the harbour.
Follow me, I' il show you.
That' s a bit of luck.
- Do you want a hand?
- Thanks.
Not much here.
What with rationing, we' re lucky to get anything.
- On holiday are you?
- Er... sort of.
Where are you from?
I' m afraid I' m not allowed to say.
I meant where do you live?
Oh, London.
It must be horrible with all those bombs.
Yeah, you' re better off staying down here.
Two of our boys were killed by mines last week.
Your friend isn' t very happy.
- No, well, he' s a Sergeant.
- So?
They have their sense of humour removed at birth.
So where are you staying?
We haven' t decided yet.
The pub has got rooms.
Oh, right.
- Thanks very much.
- That' s alright.
Bye.
Er, which boat then, Sergeant?
We need to get closer.
Any of those will do.
We' il wait till it' s dark and then requisition one.
Mum says it' s fine.
To anyone else we' re booked up, but I won' t have our brave boys going short.
I' ve got a nice double with a sea view.
If you' d like to step inside.
- It' s very kind of you.
- Don' t you mention it.
Shall I take this in?
Have you got the family silver in here?
Now... the hot water is on between six and seven.
When you' ve finished let me know and I can use it for the turnips.
It' s not a problem.
No.
It' s almost dark.
Give it ten more minutes.
I brought you some towels.
Mum says she' s kept back a couple of nice pilchards.
- Thanks a lot.
Towels!
By the jetty, with the what' s- its- name sticking up.
Er, mast.
Got it.
(WHlSPERS) I' il check the fuel.
(WHlSPERS) I' ve got it.
(WHlSPERS) Tank sounds full to me.
Are we completely cast off?
We are, Sergeant.
Is there a brake?
The bloody tide is going out.
You' il have to get off and shove.
I' m afraid you' il have to get in too, Sergeant.
- Where was he last seen?
- 0500 hours, sir.
Leaving the barracks with Cuthbertson, sir, heading towards the station.
The station master thinks they took the train to Plymouth.
Hmm...
Plymouth.
Tell me, what kind of spirits was he in?
Fine and dandy, sir.
First class soldier, sir.
- Barking mad, sir.
It' s not a problem.
No.
We' il wait until the tide is back in and we' il give it another go.
It' s a good thing we got the room.
Mum says, 'How do you like your pilchards?'
We' ve had a lot of letters from listeners who advise cooking with steamers.
- Two pints of stout, Brenda.
- Be with you in a minute.
More potatoes, Private?
I' m fine thanks, Mrs Fraser.
Are you sure the Colonel doesn' t want something on a tray?
He says he' s not hungry.
Better?
Much.
You smell like a damp dog.
I' m sorry about that.
I fell in the harbour.
It' s alright.
I like dogs.
What were you doing in the harbour?
I' m afraid I can' t tell you that.
You could be anyone.
You could be a spy.
That' s right, I could.
Walls have ears, don' t they?
That' s right they do.
Is it very... dangerous what you do?
Oh, yes, very.
Are you going somewhere dangerous now?
Yeah.
You will be careful, won' t you, Leslie?
Of course I will.
I' il be fine.
British Commandos have seriously damaged the submarine pens and dry docks.
It will be months before St Nazaire is operational again.
Did he say St Nazaire?
- I' m not interested.
- It' s not my fault.
It will be high tide soon.
Get out of here, get a boat and go.
We' il sleep during the day and travel by night.
The whole place will be crawling with men and machinery.
There' s a war on or had you forgotten?
Crawling with men and machinery.
Leslie!
What are doing?
Oh, for Christ' s sake, get her sorted out.
What are you doing?
You can' t do that.
It' s a secret mission.
You can' t tell anyone.
I' il have to tell Erin.
It' s his boat.
- We told him already.
- Cuthbertson!
I' ve got to go.
I' m sorry.
Sorry.
Take care of yourself, Leslie.
- Morning, ladies.
- Morning, Arthur.
- Potatoes are coming on well.
- How are the Garden Room Girls?
- Morning, Major.
- Morning, sir.
What has our Prime Minister received today from the great unwashed?
Nothing for the PM' s eyes yet, Major Merton.
Anything good in the 'potty pile', Daphne?
Eight death threats, three requests to open air raid shelters, seven and six in postal orders and... a cigar... probably poisoned.
God bless the lunatics.
Do you know that without them, this war could be quite serious.
Were you ever married, Sergeant?
What would I do that for?
Did you ever ask anyone?
- Why do you want to know?
- I' m only interested.
Sorry.
Gladys.
Nurse Gladys Potter.
Stitched up my leg.
Field Hospital, Passchendaele.
Tucked me in of a night.
Plumped up my pillow.
I asked her.
- Really.
Do you want a bun?
- No thank you.
So what did she say then, this Gladys?
She said she spent too much of her life mending people, to spend the rest of it with someone who smashed them up!
That wasn' t very nice of her.
She did me a favour.
Morning, Faith.
Is he in?
He hasn' t left, Major.
It' s chucking it down outside.
Outside...
Remind me again, where is that exactly?
What is this?
This ought to be upstairs.
He' s been on one of his wanderings. < Don' t come back until you have something.
It' s not been a good morning.
Rommel advancing, Tobruk falling, and it' s not even 10 o' clock.
Merton, get in here.
Faith, you look terrible, get some sleep.
- I can' t see a sodding thing.
- Shush.
Keep looking.
Do they always shoot deserters?
We' re not deserters.
We know that but do they, Sergeant?
- Has who got what?
Has the Prime Minister got the letter?
Of course he has.
- Serg, I wasn' t asleep - - Shush.
Listen.
What' s that?
What' s that?
I' m so bored of powdered egg.
It gives me frightful dreams.
Yes, but we all have to do our bit.
Any word from Ken?
Still on convoys... as far as I know.
You know what they say, 'no news is good news'.
Are these soldiers' pay books?
How much further?
Two or three hours.
Bloody hell!
Take the controls.
Keep your head down.
We need to find a landmark.
What the hell' s that?
It' s just some women.
- What did you say?
Down there somewhere, sir, some women are going on about a recipe.
- Speak French do you?
No, they' re speaking English.
- Welcome home, Private.
How could that happen?
We would have known if we were going round in circles?
At least Mohammed found the right sodding mountain!
At least we tried.
Most people would have given up at Cornwall!
This is bleedin 'Cornwall!
We' il be a laughing stock.
We can explain, can' t we?
We' il have to explain alright.
Bloody court martial.
I don' t mind dying, Cuthbertson..... but I won' t be humiliated.
What a complete bloody fiasco.
We' ve still got the boat.
I don' t mind giving it another go.
Do you want to give it another go?
Then, there' s half a leek, one teaspoon...
Have you got that?
Half a leek, one teaspoon of mixed herbs and a teaspoonful of salt and then there' s two ounces...
Psssst!
Psssst!
Ah!
Sergeant?
Was that you, Sergeant?
What are you doing?
There' s a German!
There' s a German!
There' s a sodding German!
Shall we go back and kill him?
I haven' t come all this way to shoot a Kraut who likes cooking!
He' s probably gone by now anyway.
At least we' re here, that' s the main thing.
Open wide, Adolf! the dentists are coming!
Cuthbertson! >
Sorry, Sergeant.
You don' t have to tell me if you don' t want to.
If you must know..... it' s cold, wet with more rats than you can shake a stick at.
Blimey.
For 28 days you were bored to tears and then on the 29th - boof!
The sky lit up, you got your head down, ran like the clappers and hoped some other poor bastard got it, not you.
Now, go to sleep.
Didn' t you save the life of a General?
Oh, yes...
General Sir William Hyde.
I was his driver.
- Nothing.
Go to sleep.
My dad was in the trenches.
At Amiens.
He was one of the lucky ones, he came home in one piece.
What are you doing?
Sorry.
- Well, stop it.
Did he..... say much, your dad... about the trenches?
- My dad?
- Yeah.
I thought you wanted to go to sleep?
I do..... but I' d rather you talked than tapped.
Not much.
He was killed by a tram when I was three so I never really knew him.
He was just a face at my bedroom door.
My mum always showed me pictures and I do think about him.
He tells me off in my head.
Not always though.
Sometimes I make him laugh.
Can I ask you something?
What now?
Why did you choose me?
Who else would be daft enough to carry the grenades?
He would like this.
It would make him smile.
- Can you reach it?
- I would if you stood still.
Here.
Here.
You do it.
- It was your idea.
- Really?
Thanks.
Bloody hell?
How many of those buns did you eat?
- How many shall I cut?
- Cut them all.
Keep your voice down.
It' s a lot harder than you think.
Did you see that?
You could have your eye out with one of those.
I' ve got a good idea.
We' il make a list of the things we do and then keep it as proof.
We could tot up the damage.
How much are these lines worth?
Five quid each?
Well, that' s one, two, three..... that' s 25 quid the lot. < Depends what' s on the other end.
That' s a point.
So, supposing these go to like, the hospital or the Resistance even?
Just suppose you get on with it.
Still, 25 quid is 25 quid, isn' t it?
Well, it' s not actually, it' s only ¡ê20.
What do you mean?
- I left one.
- What for?
In case of emergencies.
- How much does cement cost?
- What?
I was trying to work out how much it' s worth.
- What for?
- Well...
We put the damages on the left and what it' s worth on the right.
Are you a bloody accountant now?
No, listen.
I had a mate who bought a Riley Roadster before the war.
He polished it every Sunday, but the birds kept crapping on the bonnet.
So, what he did was, he bought a garage.
The only problem is he reckons the garage cost more than the car.
Has this got a point, Private?
I reckon that two garages costs the same as one gun emplacement.
Sergeant?
To put it another way, one gun emplacement costs the same as three Riley Roadsters.
You' ve got a head like a toy box, Cuthbertson.
When are we going to eat?
Hello?
Hello?
Hang on, sir.
Africa, that' s where we stand or fall.
He' s on the line now.
About time.
Put him through.
I want answers yesterday, Merton.
Lose Africa and we lose the Med.
Hello?
No- one here, Faith.
One moment, Prime Minister. < He' s on line three, Prime Minister.
Hello, Monty.
How are you, old cocker?
Jolly good.
Now tell me something, General..... what do your knees look like in shorts?
'Sleep during the day, travel by night', you said. >
That' s alright.
So far, it hasn' t been necessary.
'Crawling with men and machinery'.
Thanks, Private.
All we need do is find a road or a signpost.
To where?
There' s nothing to do.
It' s not a problem.
There will be plenty to do when we get there. < Get where?
There' s no- one around, the whole place is shut.
Hello?
Anyone?
We' re here!
We' ve invaded!
Shut up!
- I' m starving.
- I' m Sergeant King, how do you do?
Well, maybe we could get something to eat or something.
- Maybe we could steal a car.
Good idea (!)
Which one of the many fine vehicles would you care to requisition?
First rule of survival behind enemy lines: live off the land.
Oh, I' m sorry.
Oh...
I- l- I' m English.
Er...
English?
Bloody hell!
I' m really sorry.
I- l- I' m just so hungry.
I- l- I' il put it back.
Look, see?
Emportez- le.
Emballez- le, emportez- le, allez- y.
Emportez- le, allez- y.
Wrap it?
Er, do you, do you want me to wrap it?
Can I go now?
Thank you.
Thanks very much.
Attendez.
Vivement la liberation!
I was only getting some food.
I don' t know what the problem is.
You said get some food and I did.
Anyone could have been in there.
The whole Third Reich could have been in there.
- We should be so lucky.
- What?
- Can we eat the pie now?
- Don' t you get lippy with me, son!
I' il knock the living daylights out of you.
- Can we eat the pie now?
- You' ve jeopardised this operation.
You' ve been like a kid on a school outing, buying buns, waving stockings about, cosying up to your little Cornish pasty.
Then when I send you to get some food, what do I find?
You canoodling up to some French tart, practically slipping her one.
- Piss off.
- Eh?
- Piss off!
- Don' t tell me to piss off.
No!
Everything you' ve asked, I' ve done.
Every order you' ve given, I' ve followed.
Where has it got us?
Nowhere.
Now, I' m a deserter.
I' ve nearly been drowned.
I' m tired and I' m hungry.
Whether you like it or not, I' m going to eat this pie.
I can' t believe you' ve done that.
No, I take that back.
I can believe it.
Look at you.
You know why you' re called the Kaiser?
You' re a jumped- up, washed- up, over the hill has- been.
- Finished?
- No!
You know what?
Back home, you command about as much respect as a fly on dog shit!
Smart- arsed little turd!
I gave you a chance.
Nobody else would be stupid enough to give you a gun, but I did.
I thought you had guts, but the only thing you' re good at is whingeing.
It' s a good thing your dad died when he did, so he never saw the whining tosspot that his son had become.
Can you see anything?
- Nothing.
- A sign or something?
- No.
- We' ve got to find out where we are.
I' il see what I can find.
I didn' t mean..... what I said about your dad.
I' il stand guard then.
Sergeant...
They don' t all call you the Kaiser.
Yes.
You stand guard.
(WHlSPERS) Yes, Sergeant.
(WHlSPERS) Yes, Sergeant.
(MlMES) Kill him.
I- l- I' m sorry, Sergeant.
I missed him.
He just got past me.
It' s a train.
- It' s stopping.
- It' s waiting for the signal.
Well, which one is it?
Must be one of these.
It' s full of bloody Germans!
Heh!
Was ist hier los?
Warum mussten wir anhalten?
Ist jemand zu Hause?
They' re on their way up!
There' s got to be a lock.
- Wir haben nicht viel Zeit.
- Sonst kommen wir nie nach Brest.
Now try.
In Ordnung, kommt wieder runter!
Danke.
Naechstes Mal 'n bisschen schneller.
Supplies.
What shall we do with him?
He' il tell someone he has seen us.
Drunk in charge of a signal box.
They won' t believe a word he says.
Mind the string.
How much do you reckon a railway line' s worth?
About 70 quid?
- More. - ¡ê80.
Put that away.
Ready?
- What was that?
- What' s wrong?
(WHlSPERS) I think I heard something.
Nah, it was nothing.
- Bloody hell!
- Gordon Bennett!
I think I' ve gone deaf.
Have you?
Looks buckled to me.
Does it look buckled to you?
Yeah, definitely.
Loose as old knickers that is.
I wouldn' t fancy travelling on it.
One grenade in the right place.
- Just like you said.
- Come on.
Let' s find out where we are.
You' ve got the matches.
- Is that cheese off?
- Nah, it' s French.
Do you want some?
No, I want you to strike a match so I can see what I' m doing.
Closer.
That' s better.
Now then, there' s the railway line so we' re...
- Lancasters.
- Lucky buggers.
Hold it still.
Sitting down to bacon and eggs in half an hour.
You and your belly.
- Oh, you' re still here?
- So are you.
- We' re all still here.
- Faith, you look terrible.
- Is he still here?
- No.
He' s meeting with the Joint Chiefs.
A chance to make a break for it.
Oh, good luck.
- Thanks.
- More light reading for you.
Sorry about the cigar ash.
He was on one of his nocturnals again.
This belongs up here, I think.
How are we supposed to run a war when the Prime Minister keeps interfering.
Nobody listens! >
Why won' t the buggers listen?
Faith.
Oh, bad luck, Faith.
10 feet short of the wire.
- (WHlSPERS) They look like teacups.
- (WHlSPERS) Bloody big teacups.
What do you think?
Nah.
Too risky.
- Fly swat?
Looks like an aerial.
Some sort of listening device.
That must be worth a fortune.
Come on.
We wouldn' t make it to the fence.
Move.
Well, it' s just over there.
Come on, it' s crawling with bleedin 'Germans.
Of course it' s crawling with Germans, that' s why we came.
I don' t believe this.
You were going to blow up the Scharnhorst with one grenade.
Destroy St Nazaire single- handed.
We find one piddly observation post and you say it' s too risky.
Keep your voice down!
One hand grenade, you said.
We' ve got a bag of the bastards.
Well, if you won' t, I will.
You wouldn' t last five minutes.
I' il be out in four then.
Once it' s dark and I' m inside..... I' il attach some grenades to the fly swat, move to the ops room with the remaining grenades, then up it goes.
- Wait.
Where am l?
- You' re that pebble there.
- What pebble?
- By the fence, where we cut through.
- What am I doing there?
- Standing guard.
I don' t want to stand guard!
I didn' t come here to stand guard.
- I am giving you an order.
- Well, I' m disobeying it.
I' m younger and I' m faster and I want to blow up the fly swat.
You can' t!
Whoever goes in there is going to die!
Then what' s the point in standing guard?
Here.
Take the grenades.
- Blow your arse off.
- You and your medal.
- It' s not that.
- You can' t stop being a hero.
- I wasn' t a hero.
- Don' t give me that tosh. < It' s not tosh.
I changed a tyre, that' s all I did.
What?
I don' t understand.
The General was in the back seat.
A bombardment went up.
A piece of shrapnel caught the front tyre and we got a puncture.
And?
General Sir William Hyde told me to get out and change it.
A shell exploded to the right of us, the jack slipped, the car fell on my foot.
I drove some 10 miles with a smashed heel.
So you were decorated for changing a tyre?
Yes, I know,
RAC patrol men do it every day.
Can we get on with the weapons check?
Two revolvers..... and twenty rounds.
Grenades?
Five in the bag and five in the nylons.
- Did you see any more action?
- I didn' t.
I was invalidated out and joined the Medical Corps.
So you haven' t done anything like this before.
Well, I hate to say this, Sergeant..... but I wish you hadn' t told me that.
It' s fine.
It' s not a problem.
Four for the fly swat and the rest for the ops room and no- one stands guard.
Agreed.
Hope you' ve got a handbag to go with them stockings?
- Alright?
- Yeah.
Through you go.
Wait!
Cuthbertson.
Mirror.
Right.
(SNlFFS) I can smell beef... and onions.
Kaiser, komm her.
Komm her, du bloder Koter.
Komm her!
Was denkst du, was du da machst, hm?
Komm her.
Dummer Hund.
Komm!
Bei Fuss.
When you' re ready, blow the bastard.
I' il be in position.
.. drei Briefe gehabt letzte Woche...
- Drei?
- Ja.
Bugger!
Bugger!
Los, los, hier lang!
Halt!
Pack it in!
Sergeant Mohammed, it' s Private Mountain.
What kept you?
- We did well.
- Keep your eyes on the road.
- It' s not a problem.
We couldn' t have done all that, could we?
Let' s get the hell out of here!
Leslie!
Sorry to trouble you.
I' m looking for a Miss Emma Fraser.
Now, Africa is the absolute priority.
What the hell did I do with that thing?
I want to know everything that is going on out there.
When I say everything, I mean everything.
I don' t want a camel to so much as break wind without it ending up on my desk.
Here it is.
There, no it isn' t.
What the hell is this?
Not funny.
Now, I don' t want another shambles like Singapore, gentlemen.
Hold up.
We' re out of petrol.
Cop hold of that oar, Cuthbertson.
The oar?
- Are we going to row?!
- No, we' re going to knit a jumper.
It' il give you an appetite.
One, two, three.
He' s depressed.
He won' t get out of his cot.
- Have you tried Clemmie?
- She' s dining with the Archbishop.
He' s an old man, he needs a holiday.
Failing that, a victory.
Anything.
Something to lift his spirits.
Good luck.
- Whose turn is it?
- Yours.
- I sat with him last night - - Reading Kipling.
- Yes, I know...
I look terrible.
I promised the King victory, Merton.
Gave my word to the country.
I don' t know if I can do it.
Well, would you like a whisky, sir?
No, Merton, I don' t want a whisky.
I want a wander.
I don' t know if this rabbit is going to come out of the hat.
Cuthbertson..... we' ve got company.
< Come on.
It' s bloody following us!
Throw something!
- I bet it' s one of ours.
- It can' t be one of ours!
That' s not fair.
Not after what we' ve done!
Come on!
Blow, you sod!
Wie heissen Sie?
7 - 5... 3 - 6... 3 - 9 - 4.
Sergeant King.
- Was tun Sie hier?
- I don' t speak German.
- Was tun Sie hier?
- Sergeant King.
7 - 5... 3 - 6... 3 - 9 - 4.
1 - 0 - 5 - 1 - 1 - 4 - 3 - 6.
Private Cuthbertson.
We' re dentists.
- Have we got the girl?
- She' s on her way.
- Is there any tea in this pot?
- Stewed, I' m afraid.
Right.
Yes, that' s Leslie.
- Positive.
Where were they?
Reconnaissance spotted them in the Channel.
- Floating on some wood.
- That was lucky.
That depends on how you look at it.
We don' t take too kindly to spies.
- Spies?
- Yes.
Or deserters.
Don' t worry.
We' il find out soon enough.
Out!
Prisoner escort.
Attention!
Quick march!
No, he said that he had to do something dangerous.
He couldn' t talk about it as it was secret and I might be a spy.
So I know they' re not spies because they borrowed a boat and said they were going somewhere..... which must have been France which is where the war is, so they can' t be deserters either.
Sorry, do I sound a bit muddled?
Not at all.
Thank you, Miss Fraser.
You may sit down.
Well, gentlemen...
Let me tell you, I' ve presided over many court martials, too many if I' m honest, and i' s not a task I relish.
Never before have I been asked to listen to such appalling drivel.
You' re deserters.
You know it, I know it, everyone in this room knows it.
You ran away for a coward' s chance on easy street and when your boat sank on the way to lreland..... you invented this fairy tale to save yourselves.
What sticks in my throat above all, is that even after you failed to produce evidence in your defence, you still persist in this ridiculous' Boy' s Own 'adventure of some personal invasion of France.
You have brought shame on the uniform worn so bravely by so many.
You, Sergeant King, you' re beyond contempt, frankly.
Not only have you duped an impressionable...
Begging the court' s pardon, sir.
Who is this?
What does he want?
I' m so sorry, Colonel, but er..... if I might crave the court' s indulgence for a few moments?
- Who are you?
- I want to interview the prisoners.
- What?
- I' m Major Desmond Merton.
Chief lntelligence Advisor to Mr Churchill.
Now, I have here..... a ground plan... of some buildings.
Major, these are official proceedings. >
These buildings that you see here, gentlemen..... do you know what they are?
Yes, sir.
It' s a listening post, sir.
A 'Cap de la Hague', sir.
Interesting.
How do you know?
It says so at the top, sir.
Does it?
- Oh, so it does.
- Major...
One moment, please, Colonel.
Are you familiar with these buildings?
I think so.
- What can you tell me about them?
Well, that' s the fly swat thing, sir.
The... the what?
The signal receiver thing, sir.
It appeared to the uninitiated eye to be a giant implement for the swatting of flies.
I see.
What about these chaps here?
They' re the two teacup things, sir.
They had the general appearance of teacups placed on their side, sir.
They were outside the perimeter, so we left them alone.
Excellent.
Right.
Now what was it that you did?
Blew up the ops room, with grenades.
Major...
They are disgraced.
They' re guilty of theft, deceit and desertion.
You' re not suggesting there' s any substance to their story?
I' m merely trying to ascertain the facts.
This operations room.
Did anything strike you as unusual about it?
No, nothing, sir.
- Apart from the smell.
- The smell.
- The smell?
What smell?
- Er, beef and onions, sir.
- Beef and onions?
- Burned beef and onions.
Major, I really must insist...
Ah!
Thank you, Colonel.
- I' ve heard all I need to hear.
- Well, thank God for that.
In your opinion, Major, are they telling the truth?
No, sir.
They are not.
They didn' t destroy the operations room.
They destroyed the cookhouse.
I' m not putting up with this.
Unless you can substantiate that claim, I intend to pass sentence.
- How?
You' re not going to tell me you were there?
Not personally, no, sir, but the 2nd Parachute Regiment were.
- The Paras where there?
- 119 of them to be exact.
There were after those two teacup things, which you were good enough not to blow up.
Their task was to bring bits home for our boffins to play about with.
There were reports of an unexpected and very useful diversion..... but until now, no- one has been able to confirm it.
Initially, we put it down to the French, but it just didn' t tally.
Anyway, there we are.
Well done, gents.
Thank you, Colonel for allowing me to clear up that little puzzle.
Oh, yes, and I nearly forgot.
Message from the Prime Minister.
He thanks you very much for your letter.
It cheered him up no end.
He apologies for the delay in replying, but he has had rather a lot on.
Next time you' re in Whitehall, he would be delighted to see you for a cup of tea.
That is tea for King and Cuthbertson, sir, not...
Well...
Oh, yes...
Here are your pay books back..... which he has signed.
He didn' t want you to go short.
As he said to me...
A few more lunatics like those dentists, Merton, and I can win this war by Christmas.
The bloody cookhouse.
Well done, lads!
I' il see you in 28 days, Sergeant.
I' il be here, Private.
Yes, yes, yes, we take care of things here.
WeIl, weIl, weIl... your family has Ieft you with a bit of a burden, haven' t they?
A property, Ieft to you.
You haven' t got any brothers or sisters, have you?
No, only child, very Iucky.
Let me teII you something, Iife is fuII of responsibilities...
Miss Chaplin.
When you inherited your parents' property, their farm... you inherited their responsibilities, their debts, your debts!
Mate, that chick is a doIl.
You know, she is Iike untouched country.
No, mate, Aggie is the boss here, but she is on another caIl.
I can' t stop apologizing enough, I reaIly can' t.
Let me put you on to her nephew, he' s the other boss.
Phone.
Aggie Whipple' s Charters, Wayne Whipple speaking.
Yeah, mate.
We can fly you out there, it 's dry this time of the year though.
What 's wrong with it?
A Ioony Marion guy reckons he was abducted.
No, that was months ago.
No, mate, I can assure you there' s no aliens up there.
No worries, whenever you want to go, you pay me and I fly you.
No worries, mate.
Alright buddy, I' II talk to you on Wednesday.
Dickhead, don' t be drawing on my girl, alright?
We here at the firm we take no pleasure in performing these tasks.
But you knew, you knew!
You knew of our strict policy on failure of payment!
You failed us.
- I' m sorry, is there anything...?
- He' s the biggest arsehole ever.
- Excuse me?
Don' t think because it 's your first day, he' s going to go easy on you.
I would rather go back to working in a bake shop... than be that thing' s partner.
Come on, Constable, Iet 's go!
We haven' t got aII fuckin 'day!
There' s a prang out on South Road, you can do your fuckin 'nails Iater!
Good Iuck.
Hi, Gran, it 's me.
René, your granddaughter.
I' II be in the city tomorrow, okay?
AII right?
I need to come and stay with you for a while.
No, I can' t stay here.
The farm is gone, Gran.
I know Mum and Dad loved the place.
So did I.
Anyway, I' m getting a ride.
No, he' s from the city.
Yeah, that agent guy.
I gotta go, mate.
I' II catch you Iater.
René!
AII the way, René, aII the way.
Get it aII sorted out?
OK, Iet 's hit the road.
- Come on!
- Come on, kid!
Come on, kid, you nearly got through me the Iast time.
By the way, Ruthie... teII George EarI is taking the boat out on Sunday.
- That 's great.
- They might have a nice day.
- I' II teII him.
See you Iater.
We stay here or we head up to OneaweIly' s Dam.
- It 'II be just Iike Iast year, mate.
- Mate.
I can' t go up to Silverwood.
Ronnie is at Silverwood.
Ronnie is at Silverwood.
Ronnie, who didn' t have the decency... to return to me my prized mower.
You prick!
- Let 's go and see him.
- No, mate, no.
You wanted the mower then?
Are you aII right?
Bugger me!
You caII this a shortcut?
Stay here.
Can anyone hear me?
Don' t you know how to drive, you wankers?
You drive too close together... you should always have two car Iengths ahead of you.
Just some chick, mate, she is reaIly messed up.
I did what I could.
Is there some other road we can take?
- Shit!
- What?
We should have gone right back to the Warren Ridge turn.
No, you should have flown us out, Wayne.
Not with those bloody rocks faIling from the sky, Honey.
Everyone' s Ieaving town on Warren Ridge Road.
With aII the traffic and congestion, believe me, this way' s faster.
Can I use your phone?
Those things you saw out there, that 's only the beginning.
What?
The beginning of the end.
The end of what?
The world, the universe, everything.
God, I hope no one is hurt.
But someone may be hurt.
- I don' t see anyone.
- We have to see if anyone' s hurt!
Stay in the car.
Be careful.
It 's okay, Iove, don' t move, we' II get you help, alright?
What the heII are you doing?
SaIly?
Shit!
Shit!
It doesn' t work.
Dry your hair.
My name is René.
Miss Catch of the Day.
I know who you are.
I' ve seen you around town, you know.
Let me in, Iet me in!
Please Iet me in!
Help me!
Open the door!
Let me in!
About time!
This mad thing, it kiIled Aggie, punched a hole through her head.
Are you sure she is dead?
Mate, it punched a hole through her head, what does that teII you?
- What?
Are you fuckin 'nuts?
It was eating her brain.
- It 's that Ioon Marion, isn' t it?
- Yes.
Do you have a car?
It 's stopped up on the road.
Aggie has the keys, but she doesn' t have a brain!
Police, open the door!
Constable, get out of the way!
Move your fuck arse now.
She said open the fuckin 'door!
Dickhead!
When I was a kid, we respected our parents, we didn' t fuckin 'eat' em!
Sir!
It 's aII that crack marijuana, fuckin' hippie, surfie, dole bludging pricks!
Sir?
Marion?
Marion... you keep those fuckin 'guns pointed at me, pal... and I' II finish you off faster than a birthday cake in a fat chicks' party!
Drop the guns now, sonny.
Fucking now!
KiII them!
Hon, come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Fuck me!
Downstairs, go.
Come on!
Hurry up you bastards, move, they' re right fuckin 'behind us!
Move you fuckin 'poofters, move it!
Shut the door, you hairy prick!
Shut it, you wanker!
Shut it!
Jesus Christ!
Fuck!
What the heII were those things?
How can they get back up again?
What is this place?
- The only safe place.
- It 's Iike a morgue in here!
The only safe place?
Can I have a cup of tea with this fruit cake?
- Everyone try and stay calm!
- Can anyone teII me?
We' re aII going to die.
- We' re stuck in this tin can now.
- No one is going to die.
Alright, fuck it, just fucking Iisten up!
No one is going to die, not today.
Not on my fuckin 'watch!
What about aII those dead pricks dying outside?
Hey, don' t you fuckin 'mess with me boy, fuckin' wanker!
Constable, what 's this Dickhead got your fuckin' weapon for?
Marion!
- StiII got a Iicense, big boy?
- It 's upstairs, want to get it?
MoIly, you teII this boy what 's gonna be.
WeIl...
We haven' t got aII fuckin 'day!
WeIl, untiI you provide us with a Iicense for a category H weapon... a firearm, including an air pistoI and a blank- fire firearm... under 75 cm in Iength and a registered gun club membership... that complies with the amended Weapons Act regulations of 1997... and is signed by a member of the body of the certifying club...
I wiII have to confiscate the guns from you.
Give me a fuckin 'reason.
Boy!
Good boy.
Good boy.
Alright, I' m the Iaw here, so you fuckin 'Iisten to what I say... when I say it and we get through this OK.
We got help on the way, we got help on the way!
So you Iisten to what I say, when I fuckin 'say it... and we' II aII be eating Mrs. Welman' s BBQ snags by tomorrow morning.
Mrs. Welman was eaten out on the road half an hour ago.
You keep fuckin 'messing with me, boy... and I' II straighten you out faster than a poofter in a fuckin' rodeo.
Prick!
The phone doesn' t work.
Give it to me!
Come in, Base.
- Base, please come in - It doesn' t work!
- Tracy, do you hear me?
- It doesn' t work!
Don' t go...
- It was the storm...... stopped it aIl.
Mobiles too.
- Constable, calm down.
- Where are the rest of the police?
- They' re on patrol.
They' re aII dead, eaten alive.
- I' ve never seen anything Iike this.
- I have.
- What the heII is happening here?
- It 's an invasion.
You have to be fuckin 'kiddin' me.
The end of Iife as we know it.
We are the chosen ones.
The ones who wiII stand and fight.
It 's getting better, you' ve got shits for brains.
- You' re a fuckin 'Ioonie!
- You have aII been sent to me...... for a reason.
- WiII you just shut your fuckin 'mouth?
You dead shit fuckin 'monkey bag fucker!
These things are brain eating zombies.
There' s no such things as zombies.
So how does it feel, René?
How does it feeI to be trapped in this town with the rest of us?
Just Ieave me alone.
You don' t even Iook at me when I speak to you.
I won that competition fair and square.
Roping two pigs together isn' t a talent fit for winning Miss Catch of the Day.
No bloody way!
She Iooked alright, though, in that outfit she was wearing.
Maybe I don' t Iook as good as you in a bikini right now... with Wayne Junior on the way, but... but I' ve got a singing voice Iike an angeI and if you hadn' t cheated...
Come on, SaIlyanne, I was broke!
That was the only reason I entered.... and forget aII about your duties as queen.
You are to preserve the best interest of the town.
That 's your No 1 priority.
Ladies, you need to shut up with the girlie talk and calm down.
- The situation is under control.
- Help wiII be here soon.
If you feeI scared, just think of a happy place.
Your folks' farm always seemed to make you happy.
- I' m having a turd of a day.
- Remember when we were kids... your dad used to swing us on that tyre he hung from that tree?
We were happy then, there was room to swing... but you couldn' t swing a cat in here!
Thanks, MoIly.
I don' t get this, how do they know where we were?
- They can smeII us.
- Great!
- They want to feed off us.
- We' re Iike spam in a fuckin 'can...
- Good job!
- Are we safe in here?
No food, too many people.
- And water, where' s your taps?
- No taps down here.
The bottled water is upstairs.
You don' t want to drink the tap water.
Why?
Tap water is tank water... tank water is rain water, the rain is aII part of this attack.
What?
And there was this Iight coming down from the clouds... and it was sucking up bugs and stuff.
WeII that explains it, a Iight coming down sucking up bugs.
BuIlshit!
WeIl, people haIlucinate some times when they panic, I know I do.
It 's probably just the sunlight coming through the clouds.
That 's what it was.
- And the meteorites faIling?
I saw that.
The whole town saw that.
WeIl, I am no weather girl... but I am sure this kind of thing happens aII the time.
You' re a fisherman.
We used to seII these in my store.
Damn things sold better than the guns ever did.
It brings me good Iuck.
And you caII this good Iuck?
I' m stiII breathing.
- She' s one of them!
- No, she' s having a baby!
- What baby?
- Get me to the hospital.
- We have to Ieave.
- No one Ieaves untiI I say so.
- We have to get her out of here.
- We' ve got two cops here.
- They know how to deliver a baby.
- That 's right, we do.
- There you go.
- I' m sure you do, MoIly.
See if the cervix is dilated and, Sergeant, you mop up her water.
We' re out of here!
MoIly, get her ready now, do it now!
Alright, we' re Ieaving, Iet 's go.
- We must prepare.
- They' re Ieaving.
- They' II die, we must stick together.
- We have to take her to the hospital.
That 's a girl.
I' m staying here.
- We' re Ieaving.
- Come, slowly.
Come on!
Come on!
We gotta get her going!
Let 's get out of here!
Put it down!
Put the bag down, get your hands away!
Get your hands away.
Get up, up, up!
- Where is the car?
- Garage.
- How do we get there?
- Through the kitchen.
- Where are the car keys?
- In the haIlway.
- Can we get to them easily?
- Depends on what 's stiII up there.
Remember, I' m in charge.
You go first, big guy.
Empty.
They' re aII gone.
Bingo!
The contractions have stopped.
Fuck a dead duck, you Iittle fuckin '... fuck!
These crazy fuckin 'pimply faced fuckin' gang banger! fuckin 'come into your fuckin' house, fuckin 'unin- fuckin' - vited!
Come on!
What 's wrong with fuckin' youth feIlowship?
What 's wrong with it?
Fuck ya, fuckin 'fuckin', fucker!
AII the way, René.
Fuckin 'heIl, you fuckin' piece of shit!
Fuck!
Die, you fuckin 'headless fuckin' mother fuckin 'piece of shit!
Take the fuckin 'guns, Constable!
See you on the other side, sunshine.
Upstairs to the bathroom now!
Get fucked, prick, we' re heading to the car!
Crap, everyone upstairs now!
FoIlow me!
Backing up!
Backing up!
Fuck!
There' s so many of them.
These things won' t die.
I' ve never seen anything Iike it.
Shoot 'em in the brain.
They won' t get back up again.
Garage is down there.
Nobody goes down untiI I' ve checked it out.
On your bike, Constable.
Go on, get down.
What is it, Constable?
What is it, Constable?
It 's clear!
Come on down.
Are you okay?
Are you sure?
Shift your arse, pal, I' m driving this shitbox.
Nobody is driving this shitbox but me.
- Take me to Boongabby Hospital.
- It 's too far.
I don' t want to go back into town.
Hurry up!
Let 's go!
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Just get us out of here!
We' re nearly out of Berkeley now.
Shift your arse, princess.
I' m watching you.
I feeI Iike I' m going to throw up.
Me too.
My God.
This can' t be real.
It 's metal.
You know, I don' t get this.
It takes the counciI 2 years to fix a pothole in front of my place... yet they can knock this up in a couple of days.
This ain' t no counciI job, Waynie.
Maybe those things built it.
No.
What do you reckon built it then?
I' ve never seen anything Iike this before.
I saw a pineapple twice the size of a watermelon, but nothing Iike this.
Aliens.
Here we go again with your crazy- arse alien story.
The whole town...... is sick of it!
- They' re not aliens... they' re zomies, okay?
Happy?
We should go back in the van.
That 's reaIly gonna help, Wayne.
- WeIl, what do you reckon?
- We just gotta think calmIy.
My God.
We' re trapped.
We' re aII gonna die!
We' re aII gonna die!
Nobody is dying today, not on my watch!
We' re okay.
I' m gonna fuckin 'climb it.
- What?
You don' t even know how it is.
- This is not in discussion!
No way are we going back.
Maybe there' s an opening further down.
We' re aII fenced in.
Dead set?
Can I have a Iook?
Doesn' t matter, I climb the poofter here.
Sir, do you think that 's such a good idea?
You don' t Iook reaI weIl.
- Who the fuck is in charge here?
- You don' t know what 's inside it.
And what about that help you said was coming?
Constable, coIlect aII their weapons and hold on to them... tiII my return.
Good Iuck, mate.
I need you to relinquish your weapons.
Jesus Christ, you' re taking your sweet time, aren' t you?
The Storm.
It 's gonna rain.
It 's the rain.
I' ve seen it.
Sergeant!
Sergeant!
It 's gonna rain.
Just get in the car.
Come, MoIly, we have to get in the car.
Babe, you' re smoking!
Pour this on me!
Take it, take it, hon.
No, she is one of them!
We have to help him.
Fuck him!
He' s gone, Iet 's go.
Come on!
- Are you burnt?
- No, it doesn' t burn, it 's weird.
Take it.
MoIly turned into one of those things.
You must have seen her.
Who the heII is that?
It 's another one of those zombies.
Let 's get out of here.
Come on, Iet 's go!
I wanna go!
Hey, Nutbag, drive.
I can' t take this anymore, it 's just one monster after another.
Aliens, we must fight them.
Like heII we must!
Keep driving.
I just want to go home.
I' m having a baby.
MoIly turned into one of those things.
- What are you talking about?
- She was normaI when I saw her.
Look, I know what I saw.
Fine, MoIly turned into a flying zombie, wonderful!
More importantly, what the heII was that thing back there?
You reckon it was one of those Aliens you have been talking about?
- Can' t remember what they Iook Iike.
- We' re gonna die.
WeIl, think, it could have been any poor bastard back there.
I just want my Mum.
- There' s gotta to be another way out.
- Damn, skippy, we' re flying out.
What makes you think things are better over that waIl?
- It couldn' t be any worse.
- Listen to him... if we go over the waIl, we should go prepared.
- What do you suggest?
- WeIl, we need supplies and stuff...... we should stop in town first.
- We should go straight to the airfield... because those things could be everywhere.
No, no.
Honey, she is right, we should go back into town.
- This is crazy.
- AII right.
Alright, take us into town.
Maybe they aII got out in time.
No, we Ieft town Iong before anyone else.
Right, get out.
Just stay there.
Can you see anyone?
- You want to get out of here, right?
- Of course.
Watch him, make sure he doesn' t do anything stupid.
And we' II go in there.
Babe, give that gun to René.
- No way, I' m not giving it to her.
- Babe...
Give that gun to René, I give you mine.
Good girl.
Alright, stick close to me.
Let 's shop.
It 's warm.
Tastes Iike cameI piss.
Roping two pigs together isn' t a talent fit forwinning Miss Catch of the Day!
You know, you act crazy.
I' m just doing what I must do.
Why do you believe you must do anything?
You know why.
- That Alien story of yours.
- Yes, I was attacked.
- I' ve heard that story before.
- No, you haven' t.
I was almost eaten by their kiIler fish.
It aII seems so crazy.
Giant waIls, acid rain, zombies.
Crazy has definitely come to this town for a visit.
After the fish attack they abducted me.
I must have fought them off somehow...
I can' t remember how, but they threw me back to earth.
I walked away without a scratch.
It 's a gift, a power I have.
I must use it to fight, but I can' t do it alone.
There is no one Ieft but us four.
Jesus Christ, Babe, could you make any much fuckin 'noise?
The other two are heading down the same track as the cops.
Think about what you' ve just seen.
I am not crazy, the strongest ones are always the Iast ones Ieft. you have the same strength I have.
I don' t feeI strong, I feeI sick again.
I think the infection is in the air now.
MoIly?
But time is short, so you' d better ask yourself:
Are you a fighter, Fish Queen?
Or are you zombie food?
I just want things to be back to normaI again.
- I want my farm back.
- Then take it back.
Take the whole town back.
Alright, Iet 's go.
Stop!
- Stop, save your buIlets.
- Mate, where did you hide those?
Go, go!
Come on, Iet 's go.
Come on!
Get in, get in!
Come on!
Come on, come on, the Ioopy prick' s gone.
Get in!
Come on.
God!
It 's the rain, get your coat off.
René, come on!
- You stay here, alright?
- No, Wayne, please don' t go.
I' II be back, alright?
- What are you doing?
- We need this stuff.
Here, take this.
Wayne!
Come on!
Come on!
Who are you, what 's going on?
Wayne!
Come on!
Shit!
MoIly?
I' m over the waIl!
- We have an explosion.
Going to investigate.
Send help over here.
I' ve found a body.
We need assistance, we need assistance!
Over here!
There' s somebody over here!
We' ve found a body, looks like a police officer.
- There' s nobody else?
looks like the pilot.
Stay behind the barricades.
If you go through the barricade, you' il be shot.
If you go through the barricade you will be shot!
We will open fire!
The Army is preventing anyone from entering or leaving... the town of Berkeley.
Those who broke through the blockade this morning... are now quarantined alongwith the rest of the town' s residents.
It is believed that fragments from the Nierle comet... created a meteor shower overthe township.
Has been reported since the departure of the Alien craft.
At this point we can confirm that Berkeley... is the only community to be bombarded with these fragments.
It 's a boy.
- He' s fine.
- Good.
I' m sure Wayne wiII be okay.
Nurse, nurse!
I' ve been shot.
Someone shot me!
Someone shot me!
Someone shot me!
AII those people... they wouldn' t have died if we didn' t shoot them.
I think you are forgetting the whole thing... when they were trying to rip off our heads and suck out our brains.
Your wounds from the fish attack that magicaIly heeled... the rain did that, didn' t it?
Aliens are the saviours, not us.
One day you' re out on your boat, you get attacked by zombie fish.
Iike you are the main course at a crazy country boy buffet.
You walk away, teII the town your story... they think you' re mad, everyone thinks you' re mad.
You think I' m mad.
- No, you' re not mad.
- It happens again... this time it 's not zombie fish, it' s zombie Berkeley.
But this time I' m prepared.
I' m ready to fight whatever they can throw at me.
StiIl, I wasn' t strong enough.
The strongest ones are always the Iast ones Ieft.
If that 's not me, it must be you.
If that was the case, you wouldn' t have battled the Undead and Iived.
You would have been the entrée on a smorgasboard of brain food.
Take care, Marion.
- Brings me good luck.
- You call this good luck?
The outbreak moved faster this time.
It spread so quickly, it couldn' t be stopped.
It spread beyond Berkeley and across the country.
Those that I could save from the Medical Centre are here now.
Safe.
At least forthe time being.
The last couple of months have been nothing but clear skies.
The Aliens haven' t come back, maybe some day they will.
Until then, I must contain the infection.
Sallyanne said that my first duty as Catch of the Day winner... is to preserve the best interests of the town.
# You' d be

There' s an old joke about a prizefighter in the ring.
He' s getting his brains beat out.
There' s a priest next to her and she says, "Father, pray for him."
There' s more insight in that joke, into what I call the Giant So What than most books on philosophy.
Women.
Camus said that women are all that we' re ever going to know of paradise on earth.
In your case, Falk, there is a seminal joke that Henny Youngman used to tell that I think is perfect.
It sums it up perfectly as far as you go.
Guy comes into a doctor' s office.
The doctor says, "Don' t do it."
Think about that.
Did I know when I first met him how nuts he was?
The difference was, I was 21 and he was 60.
He wants truisms.
Not just jokes.
We can' t afford the crazy prices for the more established...
In fact, Jerry and I just met him now.
You can buy a suit and get the same cut in a cheap fabric as you can in an expensive fabric.
Jerry gives you affordable fabric, a quality fabric, at affordable prices.
Is this gabardine?
Who is that piece goods salesman who handles you?
Harvey?
Don' t ask.
You pay that troll ten percent of your salary?
20.
Actually, 25.
It' s a long story.
He was there for me when my marriage broke up.
It turned out to be hebetudinous and you dumped her.
Am I right?
You are not.
She left me.
I can' t leave anybody.
It' s my main problem in analysis.
I' m afraid to sleep alone.
"Hebetudinous?"
- You' re in analysis already?
I turned down some TV jobs in Los Angeles because my shrink felt we weren' t finished yet.
[Falk:]
Obviously, you' re not familiar with analysis.
Wrong.
I' m completely familiar with it.
Similar hustlers tried to fob it off on me at Payne Whitney.
- You were in Payne Whitney?
- That' s right.
I was in the psycho ward for six months, a vacation I don' t look back on with great nostalgia.
Really?
Relax.
You don' t have to move away.
I' m not suggesting you were violent.
But I was violent.
That' s why they put you in a straitjacket.
- Don' t be scared.
- I' m just surprised.
What happened?
I broke up with this girl, and they put me with a psychiatrist who said,
"Why did you get so depressed,
"and do all those things you did?"
I said, "I wanted this girl and she left me."
And he said, "Well, we have to look into that."
And I said, "There' s nothing to look into!
I wanted her and she left me. "
And he said, "Well, why are you feeling so intense?"
And I said, "Cause I want the girl!"
And he said, "What' s underneath it?"
And I said, "Nothing!"
I said, "I don' t want medication!
I want the girl! "
And he said, "We have to work this through."
So, I took a fire extinguisher from the casement and struck him across the back of his neck.
And before I knew it, guys from Con Ed had jumper cables in my head and the rest was...
Why are you in analysis?
You' re afraid to sleep alone.
What else?
Fear of death.
That' s funny.
I have that, too!
My dog has it.
It' s very common to living creatures.
- You have a girlfriend?
- I am deeply in love.
Really?
Yes, with the most beautiful, charming, sexy...
- But there are rough patches.
- We' il get through them.
But there are painful conflicts.
She can be difficult.
But you' d love her.
She' s a knockout.
- A knockout, but impossible.
- I never said impossible.
She can be difficult.
Now she' s difficult.
Soon, she' il be impossible.
She' s very supportive of my goals.
A novel about man' s fate in the empty universe.
Want a lift?
No, I' m okay.
I' m meeting my girlfriend.
You know, maybe next week, if you' d like, we could drive out to watch that intellectual comedian parade his amphigories for us.
Sure.
That' d be great.
It' s funny.
I was once in a cab... this was years ago.
And I was pouring my heart out to the driver about all the stuff you were prattling on about...
Iife, death, the empty universe, the meaning of existence, human suffering.
And the cab driver said to me:
"You know, it' s like anything else."
Think about that.
He was a teacher who lived on Roosevelt lsland.
Public school.
Too frightened to quit and write comedy full- time because, as he said, he knew what it was to starve.
"Amphigories"?
"Hebetudinous"?
I' il be on time, she' il be late.
She' s late, she' s disorganized.
Incidentally, that' s not our big problem.
She drives me crazy, but wait till you meet her.
She is adorable!
- Jerry!
- Amanda!
- Am I late?
- Not if we go by Rocky Mountain time.
Pay for the cab?
Are you getting the picture?
You know, we did say 7: 30.
Sorry!
- What' s the matter?
- I' m in a bad mood.
- I can see.
I felt so confident until I got up to read, then I completely froze.
I' m my own worst enemy.
I could play that part in my sleep.
We' il go have a good dinner.
I got to tell you about this character I met.
Don' t be mad at me, but I ate.
I was starving when I got back from the audition, so I had a little sliver of that Sara Lee cheesecake.
Then I had another one.
You know what I' m like when I get started.
You ate the whole Sara Lee cheesecake?
Then I figured, what the hell!
I' m so fat, it' s disgusting.
I' m sorry.
I reserved a corner booth.
It' s okay.
You can order and I' il get a club soda.
I can' t take their best booth with just one of us eating.
It' s not nice.
- It' s fine.
- No, it' s not.
It' s dinner hour.
The restaurant' s jam- packed.
How does it look?
Why do you always care what other people think?
It' s embarrassing if just one of us eats.
Okay.
I can' t do that.
So order me a steak, I' il get a doggie bag, and it' il be my insomnia snack.
What kind of anniversary dinner is that?
I' m not beautiful.
I' m fat.
Okay, I' il cancel the reservation.
Let' s go home.
There are no more eggs.
I ate them.
[Amanda:]
I made myself a sandwich.
There were some cans of tuna left.
Thank God she hasn' t learned how to use the new electric can opener yet.
My mother' s moving in with us.
- What?
- I' m so angry at her.
Wait a minute.
Did I miss something?
She left her boyfriend.
What happened?
I thought she was finally settled.
What happened is she' s Madame Bovary.
She' s married to a Park Avenue doctor and that' s too dull for her.
But, no, she wants more.
More?
I' m sure she doesn' t know.
More fantasies.
Her youth back.
She wants to "fulfill her life before it' s too late."
- Those are her words.
- Why is she coming here?
She has no money.
She has nowhere else to go.
Amanda, we have no room.
I figured we' il put a bed in the office.
In the office, Amanda?
That' s where I write.
That' s where I create.
You can create in the living room.
In the...?
No, Amanda.
Everything is in there, okay?
That' s my space.
- I can' t...
- She' s my mother.
- She' s not staying in a shelter.
- Why didn' t you tell me earlier?
You' re making matters worse, okay?
You' re giving me a migraine.
[phone rings]
I' il only be a minute.
When I left you, I ran into Danny Wax.
There are no laughs.
Not one laugh in that routine.
The routine is fine.
The guy' s just in the wrong profession.
That' s what I told him.
I said, "Danny, you' ve been around for a long time.
"You think there' s a reason you never made it?"
No tact.
None.
I said to him, "Danny, a man buys a suit.
"He says he' s happy with it.
"Then he sees another suit.
Suddenly he doesn' t want the suit he' s got!
"He wants a new suit.
He' s not happy with the old one. "
Right, yeah.
I was up to NBC.
There is nothing doing up there.
Not right now.
Things being equal, they' il change.
I need a business thing done.
I got a business thing to discuss.
What kind of business?
There' s nothing to get anxious about.
It' s about the future.
Good- bye.
I think you' re amazing- looking.
You' re just used to the losers you dated before me.
Losers?
Not all of them were losers.
What is behind your back?
Something for me?
- This is for you.
Happy anniversary.
I lost my temper when I couldn' t get it even.
Not exactly a work of art, but I forgive you.
- I think I know what these are.
- Do you?
You look so good in those kind of earrings.
Do l?
Beautiful.
Absolutely beautiful.
- You like them?
You' re the only one I' ve ever dated who' s known exactly what to get me.
"No Exit" and "The Flies."
Jean Paul Sartre.
That' s amazing.
Thank you.
I think it was Tennessee Williams who said that the opposite of death is desire.
[Falk:]
And I desired you from the first moment we met.
It' s so beautiful.
It is.
It' s very pretty.
I don' t know about living down here.
You wouldn' t consider it?
After we get married, move to the Village.
Why is marriage so important?
You moved in with me.
We' re a couple, right?
Yes, we moved in together.
I know.
All your girlfriends are getting married...
- Falk, what' s up?
- Bob, how are you?
Bob, this is Brooke.
Brooke, Bob Stiles.
- How' s it going?
- Falk and Brooke.
This is Amanda.
This is Falk.
This is Brooke.
So, what are you guys doing down here?
You think it' s ridiculous.
I think it' s great.
Maybe I' m wrong.
- Oh, that' s a...
You knew that.
Wait.
It' s complete with pornographic slides.
- lsn' t it wonderful?
- I think it' s brilliant.
[Bob:]
I always thought you had a little yen for your dad.
Ha ha.
Hey!
We' re going to a great lndian restaurant tomorrow night.
- You can only disappoint.
- Are we busy tomorrow night?
- We' re taking my parents out.
- You hate lndian food.
I' ve wanted to give it a second chance since I realized how much you... she loves tandoori chicken.
- Come on.
It' il be fun.
- I should give it another shot.
The cigarette, the five o' clock shadow.
Didn' t I say that exact same thing about Frank Sinatra?
Urban.
Exactly.
I even used the term.
That' s...
Where did you go to school?
Ethical culture.
Fieldston.
Brandeis.
One of her professors fell in love with her.
It was terrible.
He was married.
It was way too much pressure for all of us.
I try to sing, but then I hear someone like Billie Holiday, and forget about it!
She' s your favorite!
But you can' t listen to the CD' s, right?
They sterilize the sound.
I absolutely agree with you.
It totally sterilizes... that' s so funny.
I' d love to know about it.
She is amazing.
It' s early.
Let' s go to the Village Vanguard.
Diana Krall is playing.
I' il get so discouraged, but I am dying to see her.
- Great.
- You get up so early to write.
Yeah, but I did most of my stuff for tomorrow, so...
- Should we?
What do you...
- Yeah, sure.
# Hide your heart from sight
# Lock your dreams at night
# It could happen to you
# Don' t count stars Or you might stumble
# Someone drops a sigh
# And down you tumble
# Keep an eye on spring
# Run when church bells ring
# It could happen to you
She' s so moving.
I agree.
She' s totally moving.
Absolutely.
You' ve captured her.
[applause]
I' d love to take one of those boats down the Amazon.
It' s supposed to be so beautiful.
Not tonight?
Of course not tonight.
I was... that' s funny.
But how thrilling that would be.
You hate heat.
You hate mosquitoes.
It' s malaria, remember?
I' ve seen pictures in National Geographic.
They' re gorgeous!
Giant, huge...
And wild monkeys would be...
Monkeys?
How much have you had to drink?
Do you like snakes?
Do I like snakes?
The way they move... it' s so sensual.
So sen...
I love snakes.
Cobras, for example.
- Pythons.
- Naturally.
Pythons.
Garters.
Rattlesnakes.
- I cannot believe I' m hearing this.
- I' ve said this.
You' re drunk.
- That' s not true.
- We could walk on the beach...
- He hates the Hamptons.
Nobody hates the ocean.
She' s up for anything.
It' s too late for me.
Don' t you have an audition tomorrow?
"My candle burns at both ends, it will not last the night."
Millay!
Edna Millay!
She' s my favorite poet!
Edna Millay...
Amanda' s pretty, isn' t she?
- She' s okay, I suppose.
I was looking at her face in the candlelight and she has this offbeat sexual quality.
Yeah, I guess.
If, uh, you know, if you find that crippling sense of passionate heat behind those big eyes sexy.
- Huh?
- Hmm?
- Nothing.
I' m fine.
Believe me, I' m okay.
She moved in with him and I get the feeling he is dying to marry her.
- Oh, yeah?
- They make a nice couple.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Amanda?
Hey, it' s Jerry Falk.
Good, good.
You?
I' m actually vaguely near your house, so I thought that, um...
Right.
Of course.
He would be at work.
I could be there pretty soon.
Maybe, say, three minutes?
Great.
I' il meet you in front of your place.
These are great.
- So great.
I love that you appreciate old songs.
I can' t sing publicly.
I' m too fat.
- Fat?
I' m sorry.
Did you say fat?
- But I have these great diet pills.
They take away your appetite, but increase your sexual drive.
Is that how you met Bob?
He picked me up in Central Park, actually.
Oh, how funny.
He' d like to, but...
But it hasn' t happened yet.
You?
Me neither.
Um, unfortunately, same here.
Brooke and I are in the last stages, basically.
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.
- She didn' t give me that impression.
- She didn' t?
Well, that' s strange, because that' s the only impression to give, really.
Oh!
Look at this, uh, record.
Cole Porter.
This is a fantas... really pretty songs on here.
Let me get you this as a little present.
I was actually listening to this last night, and I thought of you.
You were listening to Cole Porter and thought of me?
I' d say it' s fatal.
I' m sorry.
I, uh...
I couldn' t resist.
Don' t apologize.
You did?
Yes.
Couldn' t you tell, the way I was ignoring you?
I thought you were sweet and sensitive and vulnerable.
And I could tell you liked me, too.
I can' t believe I' m in love with a smoker.
I don' t want anyone to get hurt.
Where were you?
It' s 1 0: 00.
Where?
- You smell from alcohol.
- I do?
My God, your tongue is black!
It is?
Well, um... that' s because I had some wine.
Wine?
Why?
Uh, to celebrate.
Uh, the deal.
I have to tell you, um, it looks like I have a great opportunity to work for, for, um, a very, very funny, uh, puppet.
It' s, uh... remember I...
Is this a woman' s hair?
I suppose.
Possibly from, uh, the taxi.
It was...
I guess, the woman' s hair.
I am exhausted.
She asked me if I still love her.
What could I say?
Why can' t I tell her the truth?
I' m in love with Amanda.
Why can' t I tell her it' s over?
Tell me about your dream.
The Cleveland lndians got jobs at Toys R Us?
Yeah.
So what can it possibly mean?
I can' t keep running around town on the sly and live like this.
Amanda can handle it, but I need help.
What do I do?
I have to extricate myself from Brooke.
It' il break her heart.
She wants to marry me!
The guy will not talk.
I' ve been with him for three years.
What comes to mind about the Cleveland lndians?
See?
This is what I get.
I need a course of action, and he wants me to free- associate about the Cleveland lndians.
I love doing it in hotels.
It' s so illicit.
There' s no rush.
I' ve been the other woman before.
Bob wasn' t upset when you told him?
He was disappointed.
But I was honest about myself going in.
Naturally, I didn' t tell him it was you I was in love with.
Don' t give me that!
I don' t believe you!
Those are bite marks on your back.
You didn' t fall on your comb!
What are you thinking about?
Everything.
When we first met, when Brooke found out.
Remember that?
Or when we checked into that hotel as S. and Z. Fitzgerald.
Or how we made love everywhere.
God, everywhere.
You know Fireside Memorial Chapel is a McDonald' s now?
Fascinating.
Don' t.
- Why not?
- I can' t.
What do you mean?
I told you I' m going through a rough patch.
I don' t love other women.
I love you.
What did I do to turn you off?
I don' t get it.
Nothing.
You did nothing.
- You have such an ego.
- An ego?
What do you want me to do?
Grit my teeth, close my eyes, hold myself stiff and let you do it to me?
It' s getting to the point where I may settle for that.
You once told me you thought your father was sexually attractive.
That' s not the part of him you remind me of.
It' s not?
You know, his professional manner.
Sweet and supportive.
Gee, I' m sorry I have so many turn- off qualities.
I didn' t realize.
Sleep with other women.
Just don' t tell me about it.
Just because I pull away when you touch me?
[Dobel:]
"Just because I pull away when you touch me?"
- Falk, give me a break.
- She said it was temporary.
Meanwhile, you haven' t consummated your passion for her in six months!
It' s unbelievable!
I have a theory that too much rejection causes cancer.
She encourages me to sleep with other women.
Well, do it!
Maybe not a million, but I' m sure you could find one, if you got her drunk enough.
I have no interest in other women.
- See, even my first wife was...
- Wife?
You were married?
I should have known something was wrong on the wedding night when her family danced around my table chanting, "We will make him one of us!"
Oh, boy!
I got up, put on a shirt and the button came off.
Then I went to the car to open the door, and the handle came off.
Now I' m afraid to go to the bathroom.
What did you do?
I wanted to grab the check.
- No, you didn' t.
- What do you mean?
I was grabbing the check.
Never trust a guy who fumbles for the check.
He who wants to get the check, gets it.
As you go through life, when you really want to get the check, you will.
- Well, I was planning on getting it.
Did you hear what that guy said?
The swarthy guy?
Yeah.
Dark.
There were two guys and a girl.
- He looked at us, and said to the other guy:
"Jews start all wars."
- No!
Yes, absolutely.
He presumably said it to her or the guy with them, but it was really for our benefit.
I know who you' re talking about.
I saw this trio, but I didn' t hear anything and I have pretty good hearing.
Because you were obsessed with the physically prepossessing waitresses running around.
Let me tell you, Falk.
You don' t want your life to wind up as black- and- white newsreel footage scored by a cello in a minor key.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Good.
How was the comedian?
There is truly a paucity of veridical talent in the world.
When will I meet this polymath?
He is unbelievable.
He' s read everything.
He plays music.
He paints, or so he claims.
I' ve read some of his poems... all morbid!
Cancer and shock treatments and gas chambers.
And his vocabulary is astounding.
You can' t get the guy on a word.
It' s rare you' re so taken with somebody.
My name is Paula!
Mrs. Chase makes me sound ancient.
- In fact, I' m just starting to live it.
- Definitely, Paula.
And I need some help from you.
Mom, could you talk about this tomorrow?
It' s late.
What, are we six years old?
It' s past our bedtime?
It' s okay.
I decided to put some songs together and do a nightclub act.
Mother, the scene has really changed in the past 25 years.
- Why are you so discouraging?
- I' m not.
I don' t want you to get hurt.
How?
Of course you can sing.
I' m not saying that.
But things change.
Can' t you be more supportive?
You' re so competitive!
I hate my voice!
[Falk:]
Please.
- I' ve never done that sort of thing.
Not jokes.
I couldn' t tell a joke if my life depended on it.
The truth is, I' m kind of snowed under right now...
Oh, God!
Is nobody on my side?
Jerry, you could do it.
- You just said this is a fool' s errand.
- What did you call me?
I know.
I tried to dissuade her, but she won' t listen to me.
These comics are pressing me.
- Oh, forget I even asked.
Okay.
I just have to fit it in.
It won' t be arduous!
I' m even having a piano delivered!
- [Falk:]
Here?
- I had to rehearse!
- There' s no room for a piano.
I was an interior decorator.
Tell him, Amanda.
Could you not be gross?
[Falk:]
As the days passed, Dobel and I got closer and closer.
After he finished school, we' d meet in Central Park.
He' d usually expound on something.
I mean, what purpose does it serve for me that time and space are exactly the same thing?
Falk, if a guy comes out onstage at Carnegie Hall and throws up, you can always find some people who will call it art.
Years ago, a very wonderful comedy writer wrote a very funny book with a really deep and meaningful title.
It was called "Never Trust A Naked Bus Driver."
You would be amazed how many people do exactly that, and worse.
Do you masturbate, Falk?
I mean, given the circumstances of your sex life, I would think...
I' m not.
I don' t know.
Now and then, I guess.
When is now and then?
Are you doing it right?
I happen to think it' s a poor substitute for the real thing.
Really?
Last night, I was home by myself and I conjured up a threesome with me, Marilyn Monroe and Sophia Loren.
In fact, if I' m not mistaken, it was the first time those two great actresses ever appeared in anything together.
- It sounds nice, but...
You know?
A gun qualifies as a firearm, yes.
- For self- defense.
Against who?
Against those who conspire to harm you.
Don' t ask what you did to deserve it.
You know, come with me to New Jersey.
Falk, I took the liberty a few weeks ago of ordering you a little present.
What?
They' re having a sale here on surplus Russian army rifles.
What?
You need protection.
I don' t need a rifle.
It' s like trying to get a mortgage.
Come on.
I don' t need a rifle.
I' il probably wind up blowing my foot off.
What is wrong with you?
- Everybody needs a weapon.
What does that mean?
It means the day will come when you wish you had one.
Why exactly?
Why?
- What for?
- So you can build a survival kit.
What are you preparing for, the end of civilization?
Dobel, you' re a madman.
There were actually groups in Germany called "Jews for Hitler."
They were deluded.
They thought he' d be good for the country.
Never trust a naked bus driver.
By the time I got out of bed and loaded it,
- the damage would be done.
I should keep a loaded gun in the house?
I have a loaded weapon in my house within reach.
In every room.
Just how crazy are you?
Do you hear voices on the radio or worship snakes?
You are a member of one of the most persecuted minorities in history.
This makes me nervous.
You may have to do it in the dark.
You expecting Nazis and a blackout?
I got you a flashlight that floats if you drop it in the ocean for any reason.
I want you to build a survival kit.
I got you a compass, a...
Why would I need a compass?
This flare gun.
I got you some snakebite stuff, fishhooks, water- purifying tablets.
This all sounds a little excessive to me.
And don' t pull the trigger.
Squeeze it.
Squeeze the trigger.
That' s right.
Just take aim and squeeze... [gun clicking]
Sorry!
Sorry, sorry!
It' s empty.
Dobel was showing me how to use a rifle.
We were practicing.
- Why?
- Why?
Well, it' s for protection.
- From who?
- What do you mean, from who?
- Dobel, tell her.
- I' m Dobel.
Hi.
Who do you need protection from?
Burglars, rapists, the Gestapo.
Have you had a mental breakdown?
- I know it seems weird.
- What' s this stuff?
This is all very important.
These are water- purifying tablets and that' s a flashlight that floats.
Let' s say you drop it in the ocean.
Are you joining the Boy Scouts?
- It' s all very necessary.
- Are these bullets?
They' re called rounds.
Right?
Jump in here at any point.
Falk, I don' t mean to incite domestic strife here.
Amanda, it' s all very safe.
You see?
Then I have the empty... empty shell.
Okay?
And what I do is I put this now in the breech in the rifle, okay?
So then if a shot' s taken, it won' t really fire.
The chamber!
The chamber, Falk!
You don' t trust me to keep a firearm without hurting anyone?
- Is that a trick question?
Dobel, would you say something?
It' s his feeling that as the economy slumps, crime rises, okay?
And rape... rape has risen.
Statistically speaking, rape has gone up.
- You said this.
Oh!
Don' t worry, Mother.
It' s not loaded.
- [Paula:]
What' s happening?
- I bought a rifle.
I' m not living in a house with a rifle!
- Don' t worry, Mom.
- No, it' s not.
Perhaps we should rethink the concept of self- defense.
Mrs. Chase, is it unreasonable to own a fire extinguisher, though you' il probably never use it?
Stop calling me Mrs. Chase!
I' m not your goddamn schoolteacher!
Sir, would you mind helping me shift this piano?
- Me?
- Mother, he' s a guest.
[phone ringing]
I don' t care who he is.
This room isn' t right.
That' s because it' s too crowded.
[phone ringing]
Meaning what?
You want me on a park bench?
Are you going to help me?
Make your wishes known.
- Pivot.
Pivot.
I just want to set the date for the end of the week for lunch.
Friday.
I have steamers in the fridge from a week ago Sunday.
I make it a practice never to ingest bivalves that have been dead more than 72 hours.
Christ, I need a drink.
This room just isn' t right.
What are these?
What for?
Thursday' s better.
What do you want to talk about?
Thursday, lsabella' s, at noon.
- Right.
- [Paula:]
No, you' re doing it.
- Just pivot it.
- What' s happening here?
Nothing that can' t be done with 1 2 stevedores and some oxen.
- Paula, where do you want this?
- I' il help you do it.
- Sir, would you take this?
Mom, here you go.
[glass shatters]
[Paula:]
Jesus, what a butterfingers!
Watch your hands when you pick these up.
- [Amanda:]
These things happen.
- This can be glued.
I don' t understand why those people could leave the room after the dinner party and go home.
- What' d you think?
- It was great.
Yeah, I agree.
- I know she' s been out of control.
- Don' t worry about it.
She is a little tough, but nevertheless, I will gladly help her with her singing act.
You are a sweetheart.
Instead of going home, let' s check into a hotel.
- It was exciting and fun.
- But it was different then.
But it won' t be different.
It' il be just like we used to.
Come on, it' il be great.
Hi.
How are you?
We' re interested in a single room.
- A single room is $200 a night. - $200.
Wow.
It' s amazing how even the cheapest ones have gone up.
Let' s not get a single.
You' re right.
Um, do you have a small suite?
- Very small.
Let me check.
I' il be right back.
- It' s nice.
Thank you.
Have a good one.
- How much did you give him?
- Three bucks.
Not five?
Five?
He just turned the light on.
Should I have given him five?
It doesn' t matter.
I' m just tense.
This is fun, isn' t it?
Should we order caviar?
Caviar?
You just had all that popcorn at the movie.
I know.
I can' t believe how much they charge for a suite.
It' s not what I expected.
- Is that what you' re thinking about?
- No.
No, I' m thinking of you and how sexy you are.
- I need another.
- Come here.
What' s wrong?
- It' s too bright.
- Too bright?
Okay, well, I can fix that, I guess.
- Is that better?
- No, it' s still too bright.
Really?
Yes!
Maybe it' s because of this room.
I' il shut these off.
- There.
Is that better?
Turn that off.
You used to like making love with the lights on.
Or in a sunny room in front of mirrors.
- Can we start with the lights off?
- Okay.
Not a problem.
There we go.
Thank you.
Come here.
You know how sexy you are?
Here...
I' il take my pants off here.
[coins falling]
[Amanda:]
Christ!
I had all this change from the movie house when I bought your popcorn.
The moment' s ruined.
That' s crazy.
It shouldn' t be that delicate.
It' s not about should!
Look, I' m a wreck!
I' m sorry, but I can' t.
We' il start again, okay?
It' il be fine.
A clean slate, okay?
We' il just start over, okay?
Come here.
[kissing]
See?
It' s nothing we haven' t done before, right?
Jerry?
Jerry, I can' t breathe.
What do you mean?
- I can' t...
I can' t breathe.
- Your throat' s not swelling.
- It is.
This has happened before.
Why don' t you sit down?
- No.
I feel nauseous.
- Just, just take it easy.
You' re getting pale.
Are you serious?
[wheezing]
You don' t need a doctor.
All right.
Just, um, hold on.
Just, um, breathe through your nose, okay?
Come on.
Come on.
Here.
[Amanda:]
Leave a tip for the maid.
[Dr. Reed:]
So, if I push on your chest here, do you feel any pain?
[Amanda:]
Well, it' s right under the breast I get a shooting pain.
- Your left breast?
- Yes.
Have you ever had a reaction like this before?
I hope not.
- Yes.
They' re different diets.
Then I have my antidepressants and my sleeping pills.
You had a few vodkas, you say?
Breathe in.
Hold.
Let it go.
I have some trouble with my weight.
You' re not overweight.
You have a lovely figure.
Lean back.
No.
- You' re a very beautiful young woman.
- Thank you.
Yeah, breathe.
The doctor had better sex examining her than I' ve had in 6 months!
She has this wayward appeal.
Men go instantly crazy for her!
What do I do?
I' m trapped in a situation here.
What do I do?
Say something.
Our time is up.
Suppose we continue at our next meeting.
I will stop treating you if you insist on keeping that rifle.
- What?
Why?
- I think it' s an acting out.
And it' s more to your advantage to talk about it than act out.
I' m afraid our time is up.
If you don' t get rid of the rifle, I can' t continue the analysis.
- Jerry!
- Hey, Bill.
I' m good.
I' m having lunch with my manager, inside.
That Harry Wexler clown?
I saw him go in.
Harvey.
Yeah, yeah.
Nobody understands why you don' t lose him.
- Lose Harvey?
- The guy is a joke in the business.
- Oh, yeah?
I' m telling you this as a friend.
You don' t need a character like this representing you.
Thanks.
I' il certainly think about it.
- How' s your girlfriend?
- Amanda?
She' s good.
She' s studying acting and singing.
Promise me one thing.
You guys ever break up, you give me her number.
Just kidding.
We' re not breaking up.
- Good to see you.
- Story of my life.
Bye, Jerry!
I thought I' d be late.
My mom had a gallbladder attack.
No big deal.
I' m fine.
Now... our original contract was for three years.
It' s almost up.
It' s up in a few months.
A lot of people laughed at me when I said I only wanted one client.
And a kid, too!
It' s like a clothing store that specializes in quality rather than quantity.
I said, "You do not know Jerry Falk."
"Jerry Falk and I have a special relationship.
"It goes way beyond the contract.
"We are very close.
"I was at his wedding.
I bought him a toaster.
"We are this close.
I' ve done things for him
"you couldn' t even write into a contract."
[coughing]
[tapping table]
What' s this?
Take it home and read it.
It' s not that complicated.
I figured, why burden you with signing a contract every three years?
Especially since we' re gonna be together for a long, long time!
You can' t sign that, Falk.
I can' t not sign it.
The guy' s whole life is invested in me.
He' s in the wrong business.
He should be pushing a rack on Seventh Avenue.
He put in the tough work when no one else cared.
I can' t figure you out.
You' ve been with a shrink for years, yet you' re too guilty to say good- bye to the inept homunculus that poses as your manager.
Incidentally, my shrink says I have to get rid of the rifle.
- What?
- He says it' s an acting out.
What kind of charlatan would want you unarmed in this world?
- He' s not a charlatan.
- They' re all charlatans, Falk!
You know, since the beginning of time, people have been frightened and unhappy and scared to death and scared of getting old and there have always been priests and shamans and now shrinks to tell them "I know you' re frightened, but I can help you."
"Of course, it' il cost you a few bucks."
But they can' t help you, because life is what it is.
Hey, what did you think of Amanda?
I know you only met her for, like, 1 5 minutes under pretty chaotic circumstances but she has a great quality, doesn' t she?
- What are you talking about?
- She' s cheating on you!
- 'Cause I know.
How do you know?
- Did she say something to you?
I can tell by her eyes.
- Her eyes?
Her eyes.
- Yes, her eyes.
Dobel, you have a certain brilliance.
You do.
You' re a sweet guy and a wonderful writer of humor, but you are a deeply, deeply deranged human being.
Falk, I' m telling you, she' s cheating on you, and you' re too typhlotic to see it.
Typhlosis, Falk.
Blindness.
[music plays]
Is she cheating on me?
Dobel has poisoned the well.
How the hell would he know?
Is he some kind of visionary?
He' s a simple, garden- variety paranoid.
[Falk:]
"Jews start all wars."
A gun in every room of his apartment!
Amanda' s cheating on me because he sees it in her eyes?
Bull!
And yet...
Jerry?
This is Connie.
Connie, Jerry.
[Falk:]
Nice to meet you.
- Connie is a brilliant actress.
- Amanda' s the actress!
Ray!
Come with me.
I have to talk to you.
Amanda tells me you' re a writer.
A novel.
I just finished "Notes From Underground."
Isn' t Dostoyevsky the most amazing, poignant, talented writer?
[Falk:]
Who cares about Dostoyevsky if Amanda' s sleeping with that guy?
She always talks about Ray Polito.
Such a hotshot new actor.
Animal instincts.
This generation' s Brando.
They certainly make eye contact.
She' s so sexy.
Look at her body language.
All verbs!
- Have I...?
- Read "House of the Dead."
Oh, yes.
I found it surprisingly neoteric.
- Modern.
Very modern.
- Yes, modern.
- Would you excuse me just a second?
- Yeah, sure.
Jerry, hi.
You remember Ray Polito?
- Nice to see you.
- How are you?
Good.
I was telling Ray about how you have a real interest in old theater posters.
He says he has a great source.
My buddy, Jay Binns, has some really rare ones.
He' d be happy to show them to you anytime.
Thanks.
- We could rent a car and drive out tonight.
- Tonight?
Connie?
You should come, too.
You should bring Doug.
- Who' s Doug?
- Go where?
My buddy lives in Montauk.
We' re going there tonight.
- At this hour, there' s no traffic.
- Montauk?
It' s midnight.
Montauk at midnight?
What could be more romantic?
- Me either.
- It' s just too late.
You know I work best in the morning.
But we' il walk on the beach, maybe take a swim.
- You play guitar?
I' d rather eat rat poison than watch this guy play guitar on the beach at 3 AM.
- [Falk:]
You' re so quiet.
- [Amanda:]
So are you.
- [Falk:]
What' s wrong?
Nothing.
Don' t say, "nothing."
Are you crushed because we didn' t drive 1 00 miles to look at theater posters and hear this guy play his guitar?
Shhh!
My mother' s sleeping.
That road company James Dean looked at you
Iike you were a freshly baked cannoli.
Are you in love with Connie?
I wouldn' t have even looked at Connie if you hadn' t thrown us together.
A literate actress?
What, is that like a four- leaf clover?
Most men find her seductive.
You didn' t need to fix me up with someone.
Please!
I have no interest in Connie.
None.
You can sleep with other women.
Just don' t throw it in my face.
Do you want to sleep with Ray?
[Paula:]
Jesus Christ!
Will you two keep it down?
You got any pills?
I can' t have these late- night discussions.
- I need a sleeping pill.
- I want to show you something.
It' s 2 AM.
Come here!
Jerry.
This goddamn ballad is driving me crazy.
Just tell me what you think.
[playing piano]
# Don' t cry
# There' il be another spring
# I know our hearts
# Will dance again
# And sing again
# So wait for me
# Till then
# Be glad
# The bird is on the wing
# Another chance to love
# And laugh with me
# Just wait and see
# I love you now
# And I' il love you forever
# Oh, don' t
# Be sad
# We' il surely be
# Together
# For the sky
# Is bluer overhead
# If you will just
# Believe in me
# There' il be
# Another
# Spring
Dobel says we don' t choose, our blood chooses for us.
What does it all add up to if I die?
Freud says sex and work.
Dobel says work gives the illusion of meaning, and sex gives the illusion of continuity.
[Paula singing]
She' s going to practice now?
Hey, Paula?
I have some ideas for dialogue leading to the Judy Garland medley.
I don' t know why I' m so scared of performing.
- Where does Amanda keep her Valium?
I just need a little bit of quiet, just for the morning.
Okay, Paula?
I went to the bathroom to get her mother a Valium.
I couldn' t resist the impulse to open her diaphragm case to see if it was there, and it wasn' t.
Why does she need her diaphragm?
What for?
And what' s wrong with me?
I feel like committing suicide, but I have so many problems, that wouldn' t solve them all.
What should I do?
What would you do?
Huh?
What do I do?
If it was me, Falk, I would follow her.
Why do you put these paranoid thoughts in my head?
Why does she wear a diaphragm?
Why isn' t she on the pill?
It' s hormonal.
The pill makes her crazy?
Falk, she is crazy!
I don' t get it.
Where is it?
Where is her diaphragm?
I' ve never followed anyone.
The trick is not to be seen.
Where is she now?
- Acting class.
- You think.
Christ, don' t say that.
Of course she' s at acting class.
She wouldn' t miss that.
It' s too crucial.
And that' s where she sees her acting partner, Ray Polito.
Look, I' m not good at following.
Why don' t you come with me?
I give them a little culture now and then so they don' t beat each other to death with bicycle chains.
You' re worried about what you' re going to find, that' s all.
You are a writer.
You should have a girlfriend who helps you and is encouraging, not some mercurial little jitterbug who' il have you hold up filling stations
- to keep her in mood elevators.
- I shouldn' t have looked.
What you don' t know will kill you!
What you don' t know won' t hurt you, it' il kill you.
Like if they tell you you' re going to showers but they turn out not to be showers.
Ray Polito.
I knew it.
[Amanda:]
Where were you?
We have theater tickets tonight.
Paula, could you excuse us?
I have to talk to Amanda.
My God, Jerry.
Has the president been shot?
Fine with me.
I have a date tonight.
What?
You have a date?
I must confess.
It' s with a guy who picked me up.
- Where?
- At my AA meeting.
- Great.
An alcoholic.
- He' s not an alcoholic.
He' s the alcoholic' s friend, the enabler.
Even better.
What does he do?
- He' s a horse whisperer.
- What are you talking about?
- What are you looking for, your keys?
- Yes.
- They' re over here.
- He' s 26 years old.
Fabulous.
You' re going out with a 26- year- old horse whisperer.
- [Falk:]
Amanda, could I talk to you?
- Would you really care if I got a tattoo?
- We' il discuss it later.
- We' il discuss it.
- Mom, don' t.
Mom, your keys.
Your keys.
- Thanks.
- Jesus, you' re so crazy!
- Where were you today?
- Acting class.
No, I mean after.
No, you weren' t because I know you were in the school building with your teacher.
That' s right.
I saw you.
- How?
- I was spying on you.
- Spying?
- That' s right.
I saw the three of you.
You, your acting teacher and your diaphragm.
Your diaphragm.
I was there, Amanda.
I saw it all.
Okay.
Okay, I slept with Ron Keller.
But I didn' t do it because I care about him.
No?
What then?
I can' t sleep with you, the person that I love.
And can you?
Yeah.
It' s good news.
I can!
Okay.
I want out of this relationship.
Jerry, don' t say that.
You know I need you.
Need me?
How can you need me when all these positive feelings happen with everyone but me?
Not everybody.
Just Ron Keller.
You remind me of the good parts.
You know, to figure out what the problem is.
How did I get to be the good father?
What am I, Kris Kringle?
It is a maddening problem.
We had to try every kind of foreplay.
Where' s the rifle?
I' m going to blow my brains out.
I did it as much for you as for me.
Oh, thank you.
For me?
Thank you so much for thinking of me.
Well, it worked.
Now I know that I can get excited.
Very excited.
Passionate!
I can have orgasms.
You know?
I' m so happy to hear this, Amanda!
Really.
I don' t need the rifle.
I' il just hemorrhage here on the carpet.
Jerry, don' t be mad.
And don' t be mad at Ron.
He was just trying to help.
Ron?
In fact, I' il put him on my Christmas list, if I can figure out how to make a letter bomb.
Jerry...
Jerry, please.
[sniffles]
Please.
You know I love you so much.
I can' t live without you.
Jerry, please?
That' s bullshit, Falk.
I don' t buy any of it.
She says she did it therapeutically.
That' s the kind of therapy they advertise on the back of the Village Voice.
She wanted to make sure she could still become aroused.
You know, it' s not in vino veritas.
I' m totally confused.
You' re afraid to sleep alone.
You surround yourself with this farrago of baby- sitters, this loving- disabled sex kitten who' s driving you crazy, the Jew manager, you know?
Let me tell you, I am of the Hebrew persuasion, but that guy who handles you is a member of one of the lost tribes of lsrael that should have remained lost.
There' s nothing wrong with being afraid.
We were meant to be afraid.
Do you have a little time now?
I want to chat with you.
It' s just a joint, but they have great Chinese food.
We' re in luck.
There' s a guy pulling out.
I know they' re looking for teams of writers.
If I told them that you and I were a team, I think we could get hired.
In California?
Yeah.
All the action is out there.
I don' t know what Amanda would say.
Though her mother' s always wanted to go to Hollywood.
I' m talking about a clean break.
Me with the Board of Education, and you with everybody.
Not go by yourself.
I' ve given it a lot of thought, Falk, and I know for me, it' s now or never.
[car starting]
Think about it.
Just think about it.
Hey!
You got a problem with me parking here?
You been waiting?
Too bad.
- I' m a busy man.
I have things to do.
- But I was...
- I was waiting here for five minutes!
- You want to meet God?
Get out of here!
Do what the man says.
Go, before I kick you in the ass!
Get in your car and go home.
And you, turn around!
Idiots!
My God, Dobel.
Is it so important you insist?
Life' s unfair.
You said it yourself.
Later on, in the quiet and safety of some delicatessen, we can write a biting satire and expose all their foibles and have a great, big laugh.
Two jerks.
[Falk:]
But in the meantime, they' ve got the biceps.
[brakes squealing]
What are you doing?
Why are you parking?
Dobel, what are you doing?
Why are we back here?
What is that for?
Dobel!
Oh, my God.
Dobel!
Dobel!
Dobel, let' s go!
My god.
You' re sick in the head, you know that?
Crazy!
[engine sputtering]
Start the car.
What are you doing?
[engine starts]
[typing]
On the other hand, I had a kind of odd admiration for him.
You know?
But he wouldn' t let the injustice rest.
There are always some people who will resist.
And, as he says, the issue is always fascism.
He' s nuts.
And yet the thought of giving up everything here and starting fresh in California, it' s so tempting and exhilarating.
Why do I get so scared?
The one time Amanda and I broke up, she left me.
It all happened too fast.
I was overwhelmed by you.
I don' t need time apart.
I know I love you.
I can' t think.
[horn honking]
Maybe if we slept with the window open.
I told you, shrinks don' t work for me.
I know how to fool them.
Just all that talk about how we were made for each other, and marriage, I...
She moved out.
I was miserable.
I tried dating, but it was hard getting her out of my mind.
The door locks.
We can be alone.
The wine has put me, um, very much in the mood.
Okay.
I' m sorry.
My mind was somewhere else.
[Falk:]
Then, a few weeks later, just as suddenly as she moved out,
Amanda returned.
I' m back.
But if you don' t want me, I understand.
I tried, but I just couldn' t.
I found out you went to Naples with Tony Hanken.
Well, you can understand.
He wanted me to go with him to Naples and Rome.
It sounded so romantic.
Those are places I' ve dreamed of.
I thought that' s what I wanted.
But I missed you too much.
But of course you made love with him.
Yes, but I thought of you.
You were really the person I was making love to in Naples and Florence and Venice, on the airplane 40, 000 feet in the air...
Okay.
Enough.
Oh, yeah... and at the Vatican.
All I could think about while we were doing it was how much you would love that ceiling.
So I' m back.
I can' t live without you.
We made love that night.
It was wonderful.
If only certain moments in life could last, just stay frozen, like some old vase.
[typing]
[door opens, woman laughing]
Paula, would you keep it down?
You' re going to wake Amanda.
Jerry, you haven' t met Ralph.
Can you keep it down?
Amanda' s... we saw Elaine Stritch on Broadway tonight.
She was magnificent!
Unbelievable!
I wish I could do that!
I just need some snappy dialogue from you, Jerry.
Absolutely.
I' m sorry.
I' m, uh...
[Paula:]
Ralph, don' t give me much.
I' ve never had cocaine before.
- Okay, just a little.
- Is that coc... what are you...
- Is that, uh...?
- It' s blow.
Blow?
What are you doing with blow?
And on my computer?
- You can partake.
- I' m not going to partake.
- What is going on?
- I said they' d wake you.
We saw Elaine Stritch on Broadway.
You want some cocaine?
- I' ve never tried lots of things!
- Bungee jumping, alligator wrestling.
- I' d have a little.
- No fears, Jerry.
Ralph knows exactly what he' s doing.
- Nothing to worry about.
- Great.
I won' t be a part of this.
[Paula:]
Thank you very much, Paula.
She has a point.
I' m up for things that you' re not up for.
Okay?
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.
- [snorting]
I' m not putting anything up my nose.
My God, Paula!
- Are you kidding me?
I do it right?
Does it?
Does it make you feel sexy?
- [Ralph:]
Sexy.
- This could be interesting.
Some people it makes feel sexy.
Other it makes belligerent.
With my luck, you' il take a knife to me.
[Ralph:]
You know what this does to your nasal membranes?
Eats them raw.
- Just do some with me.
Maybe it' il turn me on.
I have to talk to Dobel.
[Paula:]
It' s just a social thing.
It' s not like we' re drug addicts.
They snorted cocaine!
Can you believe that?
My mother fed me Cheerios.
I was not making eyes at my mother' s boyfriend.
God, you' re so paranoid.
Why would I be interested in a horse whisperer who lives in Topanga Canyon and has one of those giant SUVs and stupid German Shepherds and chain saws.
How do you know so much about him?
Well, he was interesting to talk to.
So you' re saying you' re on the defensive because you wouldn' t snort cocaine?
It' s not the cocaine.
It' s the principle.
- What principle?
I mean, I am too rigid and disciplined.
- What is this?
- You don' t want to know.
I wish it were.
I certainly can' t write at home anymore.
- What is it?
- My contract extension with Harvey.
- Unsigned, of course.
- You don' t understand, okay?
If I don' t re- up with him, he will truly die.
- He' il commit suicide.
- I understand.
No, I understand completely.
What are you doing?
Dobel, what the hell are you doing?!
- What is wrong with you?!
- Where are you meeting him?
What did you do?!
- At lsabella' s.
What did you do?
- Well, go in and tell him it' s over.
Are you insane?
Why did you tear this up?!
I cannot...
I' il go with you.
I' il sit in the place while you tell him.
And don' t beat around the bush.
Once you tergiversate, you' re lost.
I' m sorry I' m late.
My mom has this hyperactive thyroid.
I ran into Dick Mallory.
I said, you know, what you get.
I said, "Look, Jerry Falk is a professional.
"lf what you need are bathroom jokes, he can do them."
Harvey?
- What' s wrong with your voice?
- We should talk.
Yeah.
This way, you can relax and enjoy lunch.
Harvey... there' s no question that you were there for me from the start.
And if you think it' s easy selling an 1 8- year- old unknown... it' s a jungle out there.
And, and you' ve done a very professional job.
And I' ve paid you...
You know, even though it slid toward you.
Now... now I see myself moving in a whole new direction.
Meaning?
A novel, maybe some plays, maybe not even comedy.
The dollars are in the jokes.
I mean, you know, as a hobby, later, when you' re rich someday, if you want to try a book... fine.
Although... the young kids are not readers.
Harvey...
What?
You' re all flushed.
I' m not going to re- sign with you.
What?
Now I know this may be a little, uh, disappointing to you, but I' m moving to California and reevaluating my priorities.
- You' re what?
- I' m not going to need a manager.
You' re not re- signing with me?
- You' re dumping me?
- No, not dumping.
I' m changing my goals.
Don' t take it badly.
No!
My life...
My life is over.
You' re not re- signing with me?!
Harvey, calm down.
But my future!
The humiliation!
You' re overreacting.
You ungrateful, phony, two- timing... you louse!
- I' m leaving town.
- What have I done wrong?!
- Nothing.
- How have I failed you?!
Can we discuss this elsewhere?
This is the loyalty I get for years of struggle?!
Harvey, not everybody signs every contract for life.
Turning black!
Air!
Air!
Dobel!
Dobel!
He' s firing me!
This is the payoff I get!
- He' s taking it badly.
- Pains in my chest!
- Can we get some brandy for him?
Please reconsider.
Listen to me!
He' s not reconsidering.
He' s moving on.
Get on with your life.
[people gasping]
Everybody, stand back.
Relax.
Oh, my God!
There seems to be a pulse beat here.
- [Falk:]
What have I done?
- We should get an ambulance.
An ambulance?
Oh, my God!
Relax.
The paramedics will pound on the chest.
I shouldn' t have listened to you.
Sometimes the victim comes back.
You don' t need a manager.
Well, maybe not, but I don' t need him to die.
Relax!
If he dies because you don' t sign a contract with him, then you should have nothing to do with him.
Harvey?
[Falk:]
Harvey did not die.
I walked around in the city, trying to get my thoughts in order.
Whenever I' m unsure or troubled, I take to the city streets.
There was a feeling of freedom, of exhilaration.
[Falk:]
Hey!
- Hi!
- Hey.
Jerry, you remember Connie.
- Connie, nice to see you.
- I invited her for dinner.
I' m making spaghetti.
I can' t change the recipe proportionally.
So tonight we' il be having five extra portions.
I have news!
I' ve parted ways with Harvey.
The spaghetti for eight is terrific.
Let me explain what happened.
I start to see what it is about Connie that Amanda had raved about.
I' ve never found conventionally handsome men attractive.
[Falk:]
I' d even looked at another woman.
There' s a job waiting for us.
What do you think about my decision?
What do you think about it?
I told them I' m leaving.
I gave notice and I won' t starve.
The thing I' il miss most is the kids.
You should see the creative ways they smuggle weapons past the metal detectors.
It' s amazing.
- Now you have to tell Amanda.
- I know.
Did I tergiversate with Harvey?
I don' t even know what the hell "tergiversate" means, so how can I tergiversate?
Ahh, she' il die.
Amanda?
Amanda, I want to talk with you.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I think I should go first, 'cause it' s pretty serious.
- Yeah, I think we should sit.
- I' m moving to Los Angeles.
- I' m moving out.
I' ve met someone and developed very strong feelings for him.
- Have you been having an affair?
I can' t do all that lying and sneaking around.
- Well, where did you meet him?
We' ve had a few drinks, nothing heavy.
Just a few chats.
You slept with him?
My God, Jerry.
What do you think I am?
I refused to let myself have an affair.
That' s why I' m being so honest.
I' m at a loss for words.
I don' t know what to say.
I' m completely taken aback.
Everything will be clean and honest.
Mom will stay here till Phil and I get settled.
- Phil?
- It' il only be a month, until Phil' s divorce comes through.
Did you get a job out there?
Yes.
Dobel and I, on a TV show.
That' s wonderful.
You' il knock 'em dead out there.
Idiots who are total losers in New York go to L. A. and become millionaires.
God, this is so much better this way.
It was unfair, the way we were living, you having to put up with my stupid inability to function sexually and me hating myself all the time.
This is sad, but it' s for the best.
You know what would be kind of romantic?
If we were to make love, just one last time.
- For old times' sake.
- I thought you couldn' t.
Everything' s different now.
The psychodynamic has changed.
Who knows?
Maybe we' il end up having an affair.
I did it!
I did it.
I feel free and exhilarated
I feel confident and I' m very positive, but also like I' m buried alive.
I don' t know.
I' m sure once we get to L. A. and start working...
Speaking of which, I just bought some luggage.
What' s wrong?
You sound all weird.
Where?
I don' t think I know where that spot in the park is.
Where is it?
I' il find it.
- You' re late!
- Could you pick a more secluded spot?
- Did anyone follow you?
No one followed me.
- Wait until I tell you what Amanda said.
Maybe like Alaska or something.
- You have to go by yourself.
- What?
It' s there waiting for you.
It' s all done.
No, no, no.
We go as a team, Dobel.
You' re grown up.
You can handle it alone.
You don' t want to know.
What happened?
Just some nonsense, Falk.
Don' t ask me where.
I was trying to sell my car to a potential buyer as a preamble to our trip to California.
And I was coming home, speeding a little bit.
What' s the fun of having a car like that if you can' t get a little velocity going?
And I was stopped by two state troopers.
They were exceptionally nasty, and one thing led to another.
They made some remarks and got physical, and I made some remarks, and they got a little rough, and the next thing I knew, they made some crack about my religion, which I found in poor taste.
Religion?
You' re an atheist.
Yes, I' m an atheist, but... but I resented the fact, however obliquely that they implied Auschwitz was basically a theme park.
I couldn' t find both of them, only one.
As fate turned out, I located the more porcine of the two.
How serious?
In a satirical mood, I thought it would be amusing if I shot him in the ass, but it was dark and I was nervous, and, you know, time has diminished my accuracy.
[Falk sighs]
Dobel!
Dobel!
I always knew I would use the survival kit one day.
It' s just for a period of time until everything blows over, I suppose.
God.
Oh, Dobel.
Dobel.
I never saw or heard from him again.
[Dobel:]
In life, they' il be no shortage of people who' il tell you how to live.
Don' t argue with them.
Say, "Yes, that' s a brilliant idea," and do what you want.
Whenever you write, strive for originality, but if you have to steal, steal from the best.
And if you take very good care of your styptic pencil and dry it after every shave, it' il last longer than most relationships you' re in.
The seminal joke about Dobel is the old one- liner:
That even a clock that' s broken is right twice a day.
Dobel had a real sense of irony and would have appreciated that I got one last, to use his word, adventitious glimpse of Amanda as I was leaving for JFK.
The doctor!
I knew that doctor was hot for her.
[cab driver:]
I was just saying how strange life is, how full of inexplicable mystery.
[driver:]
Well, you know, it' s like anything else.
# You' d be

{y: i} SODA got her name {y: i} because she laughs {y: i} like soda bubbles popping.
{y: i} We shouldn' t have {y: i} called her by such a name.
{y: i} The popping smiles
{y: i} popped and disappeared.
All there?
Aren' t you missing one?
You knew?
I didn' t intend to.
Then, lay off.
Why do this?
I was asked to.
You can refuse.
I just deliver.
Part of my work.
Work?
You call this work?
I don' t understand.
You don' t have to.
Doesn' t concern you.
And your dream?
What happened to it?
This is for my dream.
I can be supervisor.
I can be supervisor.
So, this is my work too.
I can have my own flower shop.
Who do you give it to?
Don' t know his name.
- You suck.
- I don' t use it.
It' s the same.
No, it isn' t.
Some want to buy, some want to sell.
We all live only for ourselves.
Nothing wrong with that.
Want to live in my own way.
That' s all.
I do this for that.
It doesn' t suit you.
It really doesn' t.
Realizing a dream that way is meaningless.
So what?
That' s not a dream.
You?
Of all people?
You talk about dreams to me?
Alive or dead, you don' t care.
How can such a person lecture me?
I have a dream.
I' m better than you.
You don' t even want to live.
I can' t waste time choosing my method.
You' re right.
You' re better.
I had a girlfriend.
She died.
She never took any drugs in her life.
what killed her.
{y: i} My girlfriend died.
{y: i} She was a citizen {y: i} of this country {y: i} but she decided {y: i} to live {y: i} In my country.
You may be better than me.
Buy your dream with others' misery.
Alive or dead, you don' t care.
Dream?
You don' t even want to live.
SODA...
She' s leaving here.
I' m so sorry.
Was she alright?
Are y ou crying?
Of course not.
DOC...
DOC...
You get on my nerves.
Your work dumped you.
WlFE dumped you.
Why does a loser like you get to stay?
BOY.
You make me sick.
Put it away.
Put that away.
Who do you think you are?
What can you do?
I can do any thing
Too bad for you, but I' m strong.
You' re a hit man?
You' ve got no guts to kill any person.
Sure I do.
But you don' t need guts.
What?
What' re you afraid of?
You' re a wimp.
Me?
A wimp?
Say that again
Relying on a gimmick.
What do you mean?
Can' t do anything by yourself?
You little wimp.
Do you think killing a person makes you strong?
Saying that from experience?
Put it away.
No way.
Stop it.
Both of you.
Stop treating me like a kid.
I' m a man.
BOY.
I think you' re really scared of me.
You' re scared of me.
SAl.
SAl.
DOCTOR.
DOCTOR.
Is there a doctor?
Isn' t there another...?
Payment by cash each time.
Bu let missed the vital parts.
The bleeding' s tough on the child
She needs blood transfusion.
Please do it.
Using your blood would cost less.
Wrong blood type.
I' m not her father.
I' m sure you knew.
I' m glad it wasn' t serious.
What does it mean to be strong?
I don' t know.
Many think
hiding their fears make them look strong.
We' re a weak.
I' m weak, too.
A contract
I killed someone
so I' m a fugitive.
I killed SAl' s mother.
I loved her.
She worked, and raised SAI all by herself.
She was so sweet, it was almost painful.
We got an apartment, and the three of us began to live together.
SAI came to like me, too, and we were happy
It didn' t last.
She fell ill.
How could such a...
I can' t believe it.
She asked me
to kill her.
stay beautiful for me.
Saying so she cried.
How can...
I said "Let' s live and cure it together."
"I don' t care how you look."
I said all I could think of.
What do you think she said?
She said I was cruel.
What is it to be strong, and what is it to be gentle?
I didn' t know.
And chose the one that wouldn' t make her sad.
So I strangled her.
And SAl?
Who is to blame for losing her mother?
Even a child understands.
She won' t talk to me.
Eventually, she ended up talking to no one.
She hates me.
Can' t blame her.
I can' t leave her by herself.
After 10 years, she' il be able to live all by herself.
I' il take my punishment then.
I' il pay for it all my life.
I can' t leave her alone, even if she hates me.
What about you?
{y: i} After that we had {y: i} a very, very long talk.
{y: i} About how {y: i} I never saw her body {y: i} because her family {y: i} didn' t let me.
Dumb, isn' t it?
I was cooking, and kept on waitng for her.
I learned about her death in the paper the next day.
{y: i} Said I was to blame, {y: i} and threw me out.
My name is CHONAN.
Go away.
Please...
I beg you...
Let me say goodbye to her.
She died because of you.
You killed her!
My daughter died because of you.
Please, sir, wait.
I want to see her...
Go away.
I blame you for her death!
{y: i} I couldn' t {y: i} attend her funeral.
{y: i} She might be alive now, {y: i} If she had never met me.
{y: i} my grief is unbearable.
Wouldn' t they even tell you where she was buried?
{y: i} The letters {y: i} I sent to her parents {y: i} were all returned unopened.
I see fewer stars.
But the numbers are the same.
Lit by starlight, we hope to see all.
But s nce we feel insecure we only see the things around us.
When we shine the light around us to see more we can' t see the stars faraway.
The stars are there you just can' t see them.
And soon you won' t see the stars you considered markers.
Life is like that.
Anybody' s life... no matter how trifling it may be, has a back you don' t want to show to others.
You may call it failure or remorse or whatever but we all try hard to live our own life.
We try hard to walk proud.
But when you try to walk proud your back screams in pain.
The more you struggle the heavier the load on your back becomes.
You want to give up and lie flat on the ground.
He' s very good.
It' s not a difficult operation.
It' s tough to live on with a load on your back.
But it' s strange.
Only from those backs will you always see wings grow out
If you keep carrying heavier loads someday you' il be able to fly high.
The ones living here are such people.
You don' t care if you' re alive or dead?
Drop dead, CHONAN.
Can' t decide?
Being unable to decide means you want to live.
If you really want to die you' il be dead before you think.
If so, it' il be easier to decide to keep on living.
Tell yourself you' re going to live.
SAl... She' s gone.
I' m sorry.
I didn' t know.
DOCTOR...
You know...
I don' t have any dreams of my own.
But I was happy because his dream was my dream, too.
But
when he despaired, I despaired, too
What have been seeing all these years?
I blamed every single thing on him.
Even my unhappiness
I blamed that on him.
He was with me...
It' s hard to be happy in a normal way.
I' m sure he' s waiting for you.
Without you...
Delivery for VENUS.
BOY.
SODA...
She got away.
But I beat him to a pulp.
That scumbag manager.
DOCTOR.
Get hot water.
Tools must be sterilized.
Let' s take him to your room.
VENUS.
If I fail, you must forgive me.
VENUS.
To be strong...
What is that?
You foolish boy.
Such a foolish boy.
Get to work.
Hurry up
You' re a man, aren' t you?
Stethoscope.
He' il make it.
Only a few broken bones.
I' il I make it too.
Any towels around?
I' il get some, DOCTOR.
Thank you.
But I love this breeze.
Yesterday' s flower will be all right, too.
And bloom again around there.
Even anemones won' t bloom so quickly.
Does it hurt?
Shouldn' t have walked.
weren' t you happy?
That anemone...
You broke the pot.
I think
GUY wanted to hand it to you himself.
You wanted him to do that too, right?
You would have been more upset if he had.
GUY and you are not real father and daughter, but you two
are so much alike.
You' re both quite stubborn.
We' re all alone.
That' s how it is
Because of that, when you' re with someone you can feel the happiness.
You can be stubborn because there is someone
GUY' s looking for you
Wait.
What' s going on?
Wait.
What is this?
I said wait.
Just a little while.
Please.
Came to pick up garbage at the dump.
You should say "Thanks for cleaning up."
What garbage?
This sure is a garbage dump.
Wait.
VENUS.
Damn you.
VENUS, are you okay?
Wait.
You piece of garbage.
What the hell.
You scumbag.
Stop it.
You' re pretty...
Dirty bastard.
Come on, let' s get out of here.
Damn you.
Hey, nobody here is garbage.
We are alive.
We all have a life.
GUY... SAl...
SODA... BOY...
DOCTOR... WlFE... VENUS... DUSTER...
No matter what happens...
No matter what we carry or even if we can' t carry...
We are all alive and kicking.
Wait.
Please wait.
Damn you.
Thanks.
Eat your fill.
For you.
It' s from SODA.
What does she say?
Says she' s well.
Still treats me like a kid.
Don' t be harsh on her.
Shut up, old man.
You mean old woman.
Shut up, old woman
I' m a man, actually.
What is this?
SAl.
What' s "anemone"?
What?
I' il mail this
DUSTER.
No need to.
I' il hand it to this person myself.
{y: i} I' m alive... {y: i} In this town, {y: i} whlch is my destination {y: i} as well as {y: i} my starting point
{y: i} the days I live are {y: i} slightly different each day.
Excuse me.
You have tea?
Any cola?
Venus Blend.
Just one.
CHONAN.
{y: i} I could see {y: i} on SAl' s back {y: i} little wings grew out, {y: i} and captured the wind.
{y: i} SAl, can you do me a favor?
{y: i} Where are you going?
{y: i} Deal?
Here, speak our language.
That' s the least you can do for us, living in this town.
{y: i} Things happen if you' re alive.
{y: i} Or rather...
{y: i} We live {y: i} because many things happen.
{y: i} Am I right, VENUS?
Hi.
How are you?
Well, if Libby here likes us as much as we like her, we should just go ahead and move to adopt her baby girl.
Who' s the Father?
Honestly, I don' t know.
Carlos and Gaby made a deal...
I did remarry my ex, but it was only because he has great health insurance.
Susan made amends... you know, I never thought I' d have such a good time hanging out with my girlfriend and her husband.
And Mike... didn' t she mention we dated?
Made a confession... liar!
You' ve just been leading me on!
Of his own.
On her first day of sobriety,
Bree van de Kamp found an old cork, which reminded her just how much she craved Chablis.
So she called her sponsor, who came over with a DVD which they watched till her craving had passed.
Five days later, after she developed a thirst for Merlot,
Peter arrived with a deck of cards.
The next week, he brought over chinese takeout because Bree had told him she was consumed by thoughts of vintage Chardonnay.
By her 20th day of sobriety, Bree had stopped thinking because her thoughts re now centered elsewhere.
Hmm... yeah, huh.
I' m curious, Peter.
What is the easiest way to overcome addiction?
Oh, some folks try shock therapy.
Other use, uh, hypnosis.
But taking it one day at a time still makes the most sense to me.
Why?
I don' t know.
I guess I' m just impatient to get on with my life.
What are you doing?
I was just giving you a little kiss.
Why?
Well, it' s just my way of saying thank you for everything you' ve done for me over the past few weeks.
What' s... wrong?
I' m also a member of S. A.
Sex addicts anonymous.
And that' s A... a real thing?
Yes.
Sex is as much an addiction for me as booze.
That' s why when you turn me on like that, it' s a bit of a problem.
It was just a peck on the cheek.
The slightest touch gets my juices flowing.
So... how long has it been since you... a year.
They have this rule... plant, pet, person.
If I can keep a plant alive, you know, then I can move on to a pet.
And if I can make that work, then I can start dating again.
(chuckles) so how are you doing?
I' m on my fourth ficus.
(chuckles) see?
I think you can handle affection better than you give yourself credit for.
I' m sorry.
I think I should go.
Really?
Yeah.
But... but... you forgot your shirt!
Keep it.
Though she didn' t know it,
Bree had answered her own question.
The easiest way to overcome one addiction... is to replace it with another.
Temptation... it' s the name of a well- known establishment on the outskirts of fairview.
Its clientele is devoted.
Everyone who goes there wants to get their hands on something.
And when they cross a line... hey!
I warned you, pal.
They are punished... as a certain married couple were about to discover.
Hi.
You want a lap dance?
No.
I sure hope Libby likes this camera.
It' s exactly what she asked for, the most expensive one in the store.
You know, I' m telling you, Carlos.
I' m getting really tired of kissing her ass.
The woman is giving us her baby.
We' il kiss whatever needs kissing.
What the hell are you guys doing here?
Uh, we brought you this gift, and you said that you didn' t want us coming by your house... thanks, but I' m working, so you gotta go.
Look, we spent a lot of money on that.
The least you can do is open it so we can bask in your happy expression.
Is there a problem here?
No, we' re just talking.
It' s... everything' s fine.
Carlos Solis.
This is my wife, Gabrielle.
We' re friends of Libby' s.
Oh, hey, I' m Frank, Libby' s boyfriend.
Libby, you didn' t tell us you had a boyfriend.
Didn' t I?
I thought I had.
What' s that, a present for our baby?
I' m sorry, did you just say "our" baby?
Yeah.
It' s our first.
Hey!
What' s for lunch?
Omelettes.
You want me to make you one?
No, thank you.
I' il just pick at yours.
I didn' t know you still had a key, Dad.
Of course I do.
I have to watch out for my two favorite ladies.
Try the cheese.
Mmm.
You mean, two of your three favorite ladies.
You know, when you add in Edie.
Right!
Of course.
And speaking of Edie, I have some big news.
I finally did it.
I popped the question.
Congratulations, Dad!
Yeah... congratulations.
Um, what happened to waiting six months?
(chuckling) Edie and I aren' t getting married tomorrow.
It takes months to plan a classy wedding, you know?
Remember ours, hmm?
You had to have it outdoors, huh?
It poured.
I could have murdered that weatherman.
We were all crammed under this little gazebo thing it was hysterical.
I thought the whole wedding day was ruined.
I loved it!
It felt spontaneous.
All our friends gathered close around us, hmm?
Remember?
You said it was the happiest day of your life.
Just like you marrying Edie will be the happiest day of her life.
Yeah.
Right.
Her, too.
Oh, hi.
Hello.
Andrew said it was all right for me to get a cream soda.
Uh, sure.
Help yourself.
There' s also frosted glasses in the freezer.
Can is fine, but thank you.
Oh, and, uh, I left a list for you of the witnesses we' il be deposing.
It' s, uh, there on the counter.
Hi.
Hey.
I know that you' re still angry with me, and, um...
I wanted to tell you that I have, um... joined a recovery program.
A. A.
I just wanted you to know that... and to tell you I' m sorry.
You are... a real friend, and I value your honesty.
Oh, I don' t wanna be mad anymore.
And I' m so happy to hear all that, and I am so proud of you.
Oh, thanks, but I' m not really out of the woods yet.
I still have this whole court case hanging over my head.
I heard about that.
Andrew' s asking to be emancipated?
Yes, and his lawyer is taking depositions now to see if I am a fit parent.
I, uh, I imagine he' il be anxious to talk to you.
Well, it makes sense, I guess.
Yeah.
Do you have any idea what you might say?
I' il focus on your good qualities.
I could not ask for anything more.
Thanks.
See you around, I hope.
All right.
That' s... not why you came to apologize, is it?
What do you mean?
To soften me up for the deposition.
Of course not.
I just want you to understand something.
Andrew is making accusations... false accusations, saying that I abused him, all because I wouldn' t let him have his trust fund early so he could buy a car.
I mean, can you blame me for wanting to know if I have your support?
And... so... what, you want me to lie?
I actually don' t want anything of the sort.
I' m going to tell the truth.
To what do I owe this pleasure?
I want you to look at something.
Myra Holt is talking to Paul Young, chatting away with him as though he were any other neighbor.
Now I told her he killed my Sister.
I mentioned it to her six months ago when we were standing in the express line at the market.
But still, there she is, yakking away.
Oh, Mike.
I' m afraid people' s memories aren' t what they used to be.
What do you want, Felicia?
I wanna see how good your memory is, if you recall a certain promise you made to me.
- I am not gonna kill him.
- Give me one good reason.
Because things have changed.
How?
My Sister still lies rotting in the ground.
So does Dierdre.
No, I don' t see how anything' s changed at all.
You' re just gonna have to let this go.
Sounds to me as though someone' s let go of his rage.
Maybe I have.
Well, I haven' t.
And that bitch of a stripper lied to us.
The Father' s totally in the dark.
- He clearly wants to keep the baby.
- Mr. Solis, if the Father wants to assert his rights here, there' s nothing we can do.
I' il find you another baby.
I promise.
- I don' t want another baby.
I want this one!
- Oh, honey, he' s right, okay.
That trashy girl has been lying to us from the get- go.
Let' s just walk away while we can.
It' s not worth it.
Look, don' t get cold feet now, Gaby, please.
All right?
Let' s just pay Frank the way we paid Libby and then bring the baby home.
- Wait, wait, wait... you paid Libby?
You said we could give her gifts.
Everybody loves getting cash.
I could probably be disbarred for even listening to this.
I cannot condone baby- buying!
And I sure as hell can' t be part of it.
Oh, Mr. Beale, come on.
No, no, hear me out.
I can' t be part of that, either.
Okay, l- I' m gonna go to Dad' s.
Oh, wait!
Why don' t you let me walk with you?
Uh, shouldn' t you be resting?
No!
I' m fine.
The Doctor said I should actually keep my blood flowing.
Well, do you have to do it while we walk over to Edie' s?
I don' t wanna risk you running into Dad.
Okay... you guys have just been so chummy lately, and... this whole flirting thing is kind of freaking me out.
Wait a second, we' re... we' re not flirting.
Mom, you fed him eggs with your fork.
Okay, yes,
I am closer to your Father than I have been in the past.
The bitter hatred' s now settled into a respectful disgust.
That' s the kind of thing most children of divorce dream about.
Hey, Edie.
What' s all this stuff for?
Oh, hi!
Don' t tell anyone, but I' m planning a huge surprise for Karl.
A surprise?
Yeah, I' m putting together an engagement party tomorrow afternoon.
Oh, cool.
But that' s not the surprise.
Actually, it' s gonna be a surprise wedding.
I know!
My Pilates teacher got ordained over the internet.
The, uh, church of the divine something or other.
I' m not sure.
Anyway, it' s all legal.
And, well, just one more day before I make an honest man out of your Daddy.
You' re so sweet.
Thank you so much for your good wishes.
No, Edie, wait.
Um, no, it' s just that... you know, I was married to Karl, and I used to... try to surprise him, and he would always, always, always say...
"no, usan.
Don' t surprise me.
I don' t like it. "
Whatever.
I' m doing it, so keep your trap shut.
I' ve gotta go and buy a wedding dress.
Oh, and by the way, I' il be wearing white, so that' il be a surprise for everybody.
I don' t know why I have to get dragged into this.
What happened with my kids has nothing to do with Bree' s situation with Andrew.
Sit.
Well, it' s my understanding that real harm could have come to your children as a direct result of your friend' s behavior.
I' m sorry, Mr. Bormanis, but I' m not gonna testify.
It just doesn' t feel right to me.
Well, this isn' t the first time someone' s felt the way you do.
I' il compel you to give one.
But I' m sure I won' t have to.
You' re saying Bree did this?
While under the influence.
I understand your reluctance to turn on a friend, but this isn' t about you.
It' s about Andrew.
Don' t you think he' s suffered enough?
How much are you gonna give him?
I figured we could start with forty.
Thousand?
He' s a bouncer in a strip club.
Offer him eight.
He' s not going to sell his baby for $8, 000.
Are we talking about the same idiot?
I think for $8, 000, you throw in a kidney.
I' m not gonna blow this by bargain hunting.
You know, that' s your problem, Carlos.
Remember when you bought your car?
You paid sticker.
Nobody pays sticker!
Okay, and what' s the sticker price on a child, huh?
Tell me that.
I' m thinking $12, 000.
Frank, you have to sign the paper.
I made a deal with these people.
A deal?
This isn' t a used car we' re talking about.
It' s our baby.
Before you screw this up, just remember that I can go to the cops and tell them about the pot farm you have going on in our basement.
It' s just a couple plants.
Yeah, I don' t do it for profits.
Hobby, mostly.
Oh, come on, Frank.
You know you would be a lousy Father.
It' s my kid!
And I have a right to mess her up if I want.
(gaby) okay, we' re done.
Gaby, Gaby, no, just... hold on.
Now maybe there' s a way that we can work this out together.
There is nothing to work out.
If Frank is not on board with this, it' s over.
Wait!
Uh... it doesn' t matter what he wants.
Why not?
Because it' s not your baby.
That' s a lie.
Will that shut you up?
Wait, if it' s not Frank' s, then whose is it?
I' m not sure.
I got pregnant right after I worked at the Calgary rodeo, and I was very popular there.
So what are you saying, you screwed a bunch of cowboys?
You have your hobbies... and I have mine.
You think this is funny?
Oh, don' t you get it?
We just got our baby back.
well, you take care now.
Yeah.
Hi.
I got, uh, your message that you wanted to see me before the meeting started.
Yeah, I did.
Um, there' s someone I' d like to introduce you to.
Bree, this is Donna.
Donna, this is Bree.
What' s up?
Hi.
Donna is gonna be your new sponsor.
I, um, I don' t want a new sponsor.
I' m very comfortable working with you.
Look, this was always just a temporary arrangement.
I think it' s best if we just end this now.
Peter, all we did was kiss.
We' d be kidding ourselves if we didn' t think that whatever' s between us isn' t going to affect our recovery.
It' s not a good time for change in my life, Peter.
Terrible things are happening.
I' m headed to court.
I need your support now more than ever.
You' il have support, Bree.
It just won' t be mine.
But, Peter...
oh, Bree could never have done that!
I' m just telling you what the lawyer said.
So you think Bree punched Andrew in the face?
'Cause I don' t.
I don' t either, but on the other hand, she spanked my kids, she lied about her drinking and I once saw her bitch slap her mother- in- law.
So I' m torn.
Well, I' m siding with Bree.
How can you be so sure?
We have Andrew saying that it' s systematic physical abuse.
And then we have Bree saying it' s Andrew wanting to be emancipated so he can get at his trust fund so he can buy a car.
How are we supposed to know the real truth?
Because I remember being 17.
And I would' ve done a hell of a lot more than punch myself in the eye to get a car.
Karl!
Karl, stop!
It' s an emergency.
Just calm down.
What' s going on?
- Edie is gonna marry you tomorrow.
- What?
She' s planned this whole secret wedding.
It' s a surprise.
God, I hate surprises!
I know.
I told her that.
I said: "he always, always hates surprises."
All right, don' t get yourself all worked up here.
We' il come up with something.
So the thing you gotta know about me is my style is proactive.
I don' t hold your hand if you go on a bender.
I believe in behavior modification.
Some muffins?
I- i' m not big on snacks.
I' m not a lesbian.
Well, good for you.
Well, see, if I was, the program wouldn' t let me be your sponsor.
Not great for your recovery if we get tangled up in a little somethin '.
So, um, whatever vibe you might be getting, that' s all on you.
Um, Donna...
l- I really appreciate everything that you' ve been doing for me, but I think I was really making some progress with Peter as my sponsor.
And I was thinking... all right, stop right there!
You' re fixating on Peter.
Well, I just really feel like I' m jeopardizing my recovery by switching... you' re making cuses.
See, I have a 99% success rate as a sponsor because I have 0% tolerance for people who lie to themselves.
Now come on.
Come on?
Where are we going?
Hiking.
There' s nothing like it to take your mind off booze.
I got it!
I' il just be the woman.
I' il say I want a big wedding.
You know, the church, the big ballroom, smushing cake in her face... it' il take months to plan.
That' s great.
And of course, I' il have to tell her you' re the one who ruined the surprise.
You' re gonna make me take the hit?
Yeah.
Hey, guys.
What you doing out here?
Uh, just talking.
Oh, well, come on in.
I' ve got something to show you.
Oh, no, that' s okay.
Come on!
You' il love this.
Wait until I leave to tell her, 'cause she' s gonna kill me.
Well, I should go.
I' m not gonna scream or cry or pound your faces in with a mallet, which, Lord knows, is my right.
But what I will say is that you two are the most reprehensible excuses for human beings that I have ever met!
Do you have anything to add?
Right.
What the hell.
hey, Mrs. Scavo.
That' s A... that' s a sweet ride.
Yeah, you think so?
Why don' t you come over here for a second?
I' d like to pick your brain.
You' re the demographic that my client is interested in, so you' d actually be doing me a favor if you drove it around for a couple hours, and tell me what you thought.
Do you mind?
Are you kidding me?
I can' t believe you are old enough to drive.
I still remember when you were 10 years old.
I paid you a dollar to rake our leaves.
Yeah.
Yeah, you were pretty cheap.
Is this set up for MP3?
Uh, all the bells and whistles, but listen...
I really wanted to tell you how sorry I am.
Your lawyer came to see me.
I' m going to be deposed.
It' s going to be hard for me... yeah.
Yeah, I know.
You just have to remember she' s a different person when she drinks.
She must be.
It' s hard for me to imagine the Bree I know capable of hurting you.
Yeah.
Do you have the keys?
Sure.
Anyway, I just...
I feel so guilty that this all went on in your house, right under our nose.
So if there is anything I can do to help you... well, can you get a discount on these?
Um... actually, yeah.
I don' t think money' s gonna be a problem.
Hi.
What' s going on?
Edie wants to discuss our little... deception.
Exactly how ugly is this gonna get?
(edie) how long does it take to shut a door?
I can forgive your trickery.
I can forgive the humiliation.
But what I can' t forgive is the complete and utter lack of faith in me!
I mean, having Susan get married for insurance was my idea!
Okay, so if I' d known that everything had gotten all screwed up, of course I would' ve agreed.
Look, Edie, in retrospect... yes, we didn' t think.
We didn' t handle this the way mature adults should have.
He' s right.
We behaved like children... naughty, stupid children.
Well, that makes me feel better that you could admit that.
Don' t they?
Punished?
At this point,
I' d like to point out that, uh, it was Karl who proposed.
Karl.
You are gonna throw me an elaborate wedding.
Yes, of course.
Anything, baby.
How elaborate?
Well, figure out exactly what it is that you could afford, and triple it.
As for you... okay, now remember, I' m broke.
I' m well aware of your church mouse status.
I don' t intend to lift a finger during the planning and execution of this crushingly expensive wedding.
No, of course not.
And anything I can do to help... uh, you know, I would...
I could help with how' s that?
Well, I wasn' t planning on inviting you.
But...
I will need a bartender.
Oh, oh, and, um... make sure you come in through the back door.
You' re just in time.
Mrs. Scavo has been sworn in, so we' re all ready to start.
Hey.
Hi.
All right, we are now on the record.
Okay.
Isn' t it true that while your children were in Bree' s care, that she passed out drunk and allowed them to wander off to a downtown business district?
My kids don' t wander.
They scurry, like rats.
- Excuse me?
- Do you know a rat can fit through a hole the size of a quarter?
Anyway, my children have that trick down, too.
Van de Kamp responsible for endangering your children?
No, I don' t hold her responsible.
Bree van de Kamp and I have known each other a long time.
I trust her completely.
She' s a wonderful friend and a fantastic mother.
She puts the rest of us to shame.
Are you gonna let her get away with this crap?
(bormanis) please.
Do you consider Mrs. Van de Kamp to have a drinking problem?
No.
Then why did you line empty wine bottles up on her front stoop?
I was helping Bree with her recycling.
Do I need to remind you of the potential consequences of perjury?
No, you don' t.
In fact, I hate liars.
Hello?
Peter.
Hi, it' s Bree.
Hey, Bree.
You know, um, if you feel like you' re gonna need a drink, you should call Donna.
No!
No, l- I don' t feel like I' m gonna drink.
And if I did, I certainly would call Donna.
I mean, she and I are just... we' re just really clicking.
Oh, that' s good.
So why are you calling?
I know it' s really late notice, but a friend of mine, uh, got engaged and she' s throwing a party, and I thought, um, maybe you' d like to come.
Bree... well, you' re not my sponsor anymore, so I assume this is allowable.
I mean, it' s just a casual get- together.
And they' re having sushi.
You do like sushi, don' t you?
Bree...
okay, Peter, I just really... need us to be friends.
When I' m with you, I' m not myself, which is a good thing.
I can...
I can relax when I' m with you in a way that I can' t when I' m with other people.
With them, I have to pretend that I have it all together, but... you know that I don' t, so it' s just so much easier.
Come on, it' s just A... it' s just a dumb old party.
Bree... do not call me again.
Paul!
I am so glad you made it.
Although, frankly, I' m a little surprised to get it considering how people in this neighborhood feel about me.
You know me.
I like to be inclusive.
It' s heavy.
This is flat.
I think I' d like, um... a rusty nail.
A what now?
It' s a cocktail, well, I' m not really sure what' s in it.
But it sounds obscure and complicated, so chop- chop.
Hey, hey.
Put that down.
We gotta go.
- Our birth mother just went into labor.
- What?
- That' s fantastic!
- Yeah, can you believe it?
We' re gonna be parents.
(laughs) I' il go get the car.
Come on.
We were supposed to have four weeks.
She promised me the baby wasn' t due for four more weeks.
We don' t have anything!
We don' t... we don' t have diapers, and we don' t have the stuff babies drink.
Formula.
You know, this is a total inconvenience.
Welcome to parenthood.
Come on.
This is your Father' s bartender bible.
- See if you can find a recipe for a rusty nail.
- Okay.
Um, Mom?
Where' d you find that?
It was stuck in here between a pink squirrel and a pisco sour.
Well, why is your Father keeping this?
Why you think?
Hey, Susie.
Karl, this marriage... our marriage, this fake marriage, that' s what it is, right?
Fake.
What are you talking about?
What' s this?
Nothing.
- Mm- hmm.
Okay, then, repeat after me.
"and I' m going to marry the woman I really love...
Edie Britt. "
If that' s what you want me to say.
No, no, no, no!
It' s not about what I want you to say.
You have to want to say that you want to marry Edie.
Don' t worry about this, Susie.
Why are you hanging on to that?
I need to look at it from time to time.
Why?
Consider it my punishment.
For screwing up the best thing that ever happened to me.
Oh, no, no, no.
This is not happening.
Mmm!
Oh!
Will you...
- Are you crazy?!
- Just tell me what to do, Susie.
If you want me to marry Edie, I will.
You want me to call off the wedding, I' il do it.
- I' m putty.
Whoa!
What are you doing?
I' m, just, uh, putting away some coats.
Well, it' s time to open my presents.
Let' s go.
Oh, hello.
Hi.
Hi.
Um, I need some advice from a professional.
I' d like to get stinking drunk.
Do you have anything that can accomplish that in a hurry?
I forgot the lamaze book in my purse!
Let' s go.
We' il wing it.
Oh, we missed it!
The kid just slipped right out.
Are you family?
They' re the parents.
Would you like to help?
No, thanks.
You guys look like you got it covered.
Oh, are you sure, honey?
Come on, Gaby.
I just, um...
l- I don' t wanna do anything to screw it up.
She won' t break.
Here.
Okay.
Hi.
Hi.
Oh, honey, you were right.
About what?
It was all worth it.
- Serving bowls.
- Just what I needed, Lynette.
There' s a gift receipt taped to the bottom of the box.
Thank God!
Okay, the next one is from Felicia.
I do hope you like it.
Oh, you know what they say... good things come in small packages.
What is it?
Teeth?
Dentures.
They were my dear Sister Martha' s.
I' m sure none of you knew, but she had orthodontic issues from the time she was a ild.
Thank you.
I know it' s an unconventional gift for an engagement party, but you and Martha were such close friends, Edie.
I wanted you to have something truly personal to remember her by, since she left us so... abruptly.
You know, when Paul Young strangled her, crushed her windpipe and buried her alive next to a garbage- strewn hiking trail.
Felicia, uh...
I think you' ve had enough.
I do apologize if I' ve offended anyone, but... while you all are chitchatting and eating these gummy hors d' oeuvres, just remember... you' re in the company of a murderer.
Bree?
Bree?
Why didn' t you call Donna?
I don' t need Donna.
I need you.
You know, I don' t even like redheads.
Okay, it' s my turn.
In a minute.
Come on, you' re hogging her.
(frank) tell me!
You tell me who it is, Libby.
(libby) are you drunk?
Hmm?
I got to know.
I already told you, he' s just some rodeo guy.
- I don' t even remember his name.
- Liar!
What are you doing?
I am gonna light myself on fire.
He' s gonna light himself on fire with coffee liqueur?
Would not have been my choice.
Tell me his name, or I' m gonna do it!
Frank, you' re being an idiot.
It was Dale, okay?
It was Dale.
(woman over P. A.) security to maternity.
My brother Dale?
He' s a kid!
Well, he' s 19, Frank.
He knows which end is up.
Wait, what is she saying?
There' s a Father.
Hey!
Hey!
No.
(frank) leave me alone!
I' m not giving up the baby.
Let' s get him out of here.
No!
No!
What the hell are you doing?
Taking our baby home.
She' s not ours.
The papers aren' t valid anymore.
She has a Father.
Do you really wanna leave this beautiful little girl with that white trash freak show?!
Well, come on, then.
Where?
Maternity.
All right.
Hurry up!
I' m hurrying.
Man, there' s a lot of straps on this thing!
How does this thing go in?
Read the instructions!
"Pass strap 'a' through strap 'b,'
Making sure that the harness clip is at the chest level. "
- Well, which damn one is the harness clip?
- That is after the baby is in.
You have to connect it to the car first!
I told you we should' ve got an S. U. V.!
Okay, stop yelling!
This is very complicated.
Oh, for God' s sakes.
Just take the baby.
We' re good to go.
Give me the baby.
You know this isn' t gonna end well.
You know, they' re just gonna try and take her back.
But we don' t have to make it easy for them.
Gaby, I...
look, just buckle up!
Temptation comes to all of us.
Whether or not we succumb depends on our ability to recognize its disguise.
Sometimes it arrives in the form of an old flame, flickering back to life.
Or a new friend who could end up being so much more.
Or a young child who awakens feelings we didn' t know we had.
And so we give in to temptation, all the while knowing come morning, we' il have to suffer the consequences.
Wersja:
DRWAL
[Man Thinking]
Motherfucking cocksucker.
Motherfucking shit fucker.!
What am I doing?
What am I doing?
I' m doing the best that I can.
I know that' s all I can ask of myself.
But is that good enough?
Is my work doing any good?
Is it hopeless to try and change things?
The African guy' s a sign, right?
Because if he isn' t... then nothing in this world makes any sense to me.
I' m fucked.
Maybe I should quit.
Don' t quit.
Maybe I should just fucking quit.
I don' t know what the fuck I' m supposed to fucking do anymore.
Ducker.
Duck!
I' m glad we saved a piece of this marsh.
I know it' s small, but at least it' s something.
- [Camera Shutter Clicks]
We' re going to save a lot more of this place.
To celebrate, I have a poem I' d like to read.
"Nobody sits like this rock sits.
The rock just sits and is.
You show us how to just sit here, and that' s what we need. "
Yeah, we did it.
- Yeah, local paper' s here.
What' s wrong?
It' s just I have an appointment to check out this African guy.
- What African guy?
- Exactly.
Come on.
Hello.
Albert Markovski.
I have a 1: 00 appointment.
Sorry, I' m late.
This place is like a maze.
Have a seat.
Why don' t you just tell me what your situation is.
Look, I' m not really sure I know exactly what you guys do here, all right?
Well, we, uh -- We' il investigate and solve your case.
- How?
- If you sign a contract, we' il follow you.
- Yes.
- On me?
- Yes.
- Will you be spying on me in the bathroom?
- Yes.
- In the bathroom?
- Yes.
- Why?
- There' s nothing too small.
You know when police find the slightest bit of D. N. A. and build a case?
If we might see you -- you floss or masturbate... that could be the key to your entire reality.
- That' s right.
So we can figure out your situation and resolve your crisis.
In addition, my associate will approach your case from a different angle.
What do you mean a different angle?
What does that mean?
Regarding your perception of reality.
He' il tell you about that.
- Who sent you here?
- Nobody.
I found your card.
- Where?
- In some fancy restaurant that I' d never been to before.
I didn' t have the proper attire.
So they let me borrow a suitjacket.
I reached into my pocket, and there was your card.
The weird thing is I always have a jacket.
But not that day?
- No.
- Brad Stand.
- Hey.
- Kind of a coincidence.
My case is a coincidence.
- About the restaurant and thejacket?
- No, no.
That- That' s --
I' m talking about a big coincidence.
It involves one man.
It' s a three- parter.
Ready?
Dirst part.
I went to a place called Schottinger' s photo archives.
I was there getting stills of early Bob Dylan.
In comes this tall African guy.
He' s like 1 8 years old or something.
You know, he' s in there getting photos of Morris Chestnut...
Shaquille O' Neal, Jim Carrey.
He' s an autograph hound.
Kind of guy likes to get... glossies of famous people and get them signed.
Two weeks later, I see the same African guy.
He' s working as a doorman at my friend' s building.
Oh, my God!
- Jay Wendorff.
But it' s not his apartment.
- It' s his girlfriend' s.
- What' s her name?
Uh, Kelly.
Kelly Coulter.
So, okay, that' s two.
One time at Schottinger' s photo archive... second time as the doorman.
Third, I see this man, he' s in a van at the mall.
- What are you doing at the mall?
- I' m working.
- [Horn Honking]
Yeah, he' s back.
You crazy bastard.
You don' t plant no tree in this parking lot!
I gotta come take that tree, remove it and let traffic through.
You' rejust creatin 'more work for me.
- They' re not always meaningful.
- Yeah, it' s meaningful.
- Meaningful how?
- That' s what I want you to find out.
- About your life.
- Yeah, about my life.
And about the whole thing.
About the universe, you know?
The big one.
I mean, should I keep doing what I' m doing?
Is it hopeless?
Mr. Markovski, we see a lot of people in here... who claim they want to know the ultimate truth about reality.
They want to peer under the surface at the big everything... but this can be a very painful process full of surprises.
It can dismantle the world as you know it.
That' s why most people prefer to remain on the surface of things.
Maybe you should go home.
Let sleeping dogs lie.
Take it easy.
What do you say?
I say don' t give me the brush- off.
Please.
I want to know.
This is big.
- Have you ever transcended space and time?
- Yes.
No.
Uh, time not space.
No, I don' t know what you' re talking about.
I take it you don' t make very much money, Mr. Markovski.
Is that gonna be a problem?
Are you expensive, what you do?
We have a sliding scale.
Some of our clients pay $30 a week.
Some of our wealthy clients pay several thousand a week.
I can' t believe you guys actually exist.
How long have you been doing this?
- Seventeen years, 352 cases.
That' s crazy.
I' m gonna have to ask you to please steer clear of my office... because my work situation is a little shaky, all right?
You want us to stay away from your job?
Yeah.
If you come snooping around my office... it could make me look unstable and it could hurt me.
I want you to meet my colleague.
- Uh- huh.
- This is Mr. Markovski.
- Hi.
- He' s going to have to be pro bono.
Sounds good.
Thank you very much for taking on my case.
- Oh, you' re welcome.
You' re welcome.
- Hold on.
- He hasn' t signed a contract.
- Let' s do this and then we' il get to the contract.
- It' s too much too soon.
That' s the nature of the beast.
- Approach, patience, finesse.
- Will you stop?
- Come on.
- We need to start with his specifics, Bernard.
We need to go past logic though.
Let' s go.
Come on.
- Okay.
Will you tell me where we' re having dinner tonight?
- Korean barbecue.
- Really?
Okay, let' s get started.
Is this part of my investigation?
Yes.
Say this blanket represents all the matter and energy in the universe, okay?
You, me, everything.
Nothing has been left out, all right?
All the particles, everything.
- What' s outside this blanket?
- More blankets.
That' s the point.
- Blanket' s everything.
This is everything.
Let' s just say that this is me, all right?
And I' m, what, 60- odd years old and I' m wearing a gray suit.
And let' s say over here, this is you.
And, you' re -- I don' t know, you' re 21.
You got dark hair, etc.
And over here, this is Vivian, my wife and colleague.
Then over here, this is the Eiffel tower, right?
It' s Paris.
And this is a war.
And this is, uh, a museum.
And this is a disease.
And this is an orgasm.
And this is a hamburger.
- Everything is the same even if it' s different.
- Exactly.
But our everyday mind forgets this.
We think everything is separate.
I' m over here.
You' re over there.
Which is true.
But it' s not the whole truth because we' re all connected.
Because we... are connected.
Sure.
Sure.
Sure.
- Okay?
- Yeah.
- All right, now, we need to learn... how to see the blanket truth all the time.
Right in the everyday stuff.
And that' s what this is for.
- Why?
- Why what?
Why do I need to learn how to see the blanket thing all the time in the everyday stuff?
You wouldn' t want to miss out on the big picture, would you?
- That' s partly why you' re here, right?
And this is it.
I' m talking about it right now.
It will take a while for you to get it, you know?
- [Zipper Unzipping]
- How?
- When you get the blanket thing you can relax... because everything you could ever want or be, you already have and are.
- That sound pretty good?
- That sounds very good.
- All right, get in.
- You want me to get in?
- So, get in here?
- Yeah.
- What' s going to happen to me in there?
- Oh, hey, you' re gonna see.
You' il find out.
- [Heart Beating]
This room, this street... this town, this country, this economy... this history, this planet.
Your body, your senses, yourjob.
Everything that you identify with.
How' s it going?
You' re an asshole.
We will fucking destroy you, deary.
I like Shaq.
- [Girl Squeals]
- Brad Stand.
- Hey, how are you?
So what' s the Open Spaces take on that?
Well, I think you guys can definitely rebuild in areas... that are already run- down instead of tearing up new land.
- [Albert' s Voice]
New land.
- We' re open to that.
That' s who we are at Open Spaces.
We can' t throw that away.
We' re not asking you to throw that away.
I' m not gonna bullshit you, right?
Part of this is we took a beating in the press for all our growth.
Opening so many stores in such a short time.
So if we work with you and your Open Spaces Coalition... is that gonna help the Huckabees image?
Yes.
Does it help me?
Yes.
Do I benefit from getting some great P. R. for Huckabees when we need it?
Absolutely.
But do I care about saving the open spaces?
Yes, I do.
Don' t look at me.
What' s wrong with you?
Beat it, you little pussy.
- What' s wrong with you?
- Pussy.
- You' re an asshole.
- How are you?
Okay?
You doing okay?
I thought you said that was going to relax me.
Eventually, but you have to practice at home.
Okay?
You got a lot of layers in there, don' t you?
All right?
How am I supposed to practice at home?
I don' t have one of these.
It doesn' t matter.
What you can do -- It --
Just use an eye mask or shut your eyes, okay?
Um, hi.
What should I be doing?
Whatever you normally do.
I wanted to thank you for what you did with the oak tree.
I played in that tree when I was little.
- [Phone Ringing]
[Woman' s Voice]
I have some questions... about power lines over the playground where my daughter goes to school.
Please call me.
I' m Marjorie at 96 --
- Hey, we got to talk, man.
- Hey, what' s going on?
Where is everybody?
- Brad moved the meeting.
- He what?
- To Huckabees corporate.
I want you to do this.
I want you to get me the national office on the phone right now.
Call Orrin Spence and tell him that Brad is trying to hijack my coalition.
- This should' ve gone to the other chapter a week ago.
- I want those flyers...
- outta the parking lot.
- It' s a free country.
The poems work.
- Oh, you are pissing people off.
- Oh, no, I' m not.
- Yeah, you really are.
You' re pissing people -- - No, I' m not.
If my poems had gone out with the Shania mailing, it' d be a different story.
You know what?
You' re not leading this coalition anymore.
- I am the coalition.
- Uh- huh.
Not for long.
- Tell him it' s important.
- I' m not going to any meeting at Huckabees.
- I can' t get 'em.
- Can you just keep trying?
Just keep trying.
Orrin Spence.
Brad cannot do this to us, all right?
- How can she get you out of the charter, man?
- She can' t!
This is my work situation, the one I was telling you about.
It' s a little --
I' il describe it later to you if we could just --
- Don' t worry, Albert.
We' re gonna knock that meeting on its ass.
- Copy these and get these out.
You' re fighting suburban sprawl and this fellow, Brad Stand, and you have had a falling out.
Remember, I told you not to come by my work?
Oh, yes, I remember.
Now, tell me, did the coalition inspire the poetry?
- Or did the poetry inspire the coalition?
- This is looking weird.
- Can we schedule a time when you can come by?
- This thread of your --
This has nothing to do with my coincidence.
My coincidence has to do with an African man.
Viv.!
Viv.!
Mr. Corn is having a crisis.
You better talk to him.
Mr. Corn, crisis.
- Tommy, what is it?
- I got a serious situation here.
- Tell me what' s happening.
- She wants to talk about my work situation.
- I want to know about my coincidences.
- What' s happening now?
This is what' s happening now.
She' s spying --
- Talking about the blanket.
- I don' t want to do the blanket right now.
Like this.
Whoa.
What' s going on?
I need facts, Bernard, to piece together a theory.
No time for infinity?
Gotta piece together a theory?
- What?
What?
Listen, you go visit Mr. Corn.
His wife is leaving him.
I think I' ve got a really hot lead, Bernard.
Albert, the universe is an infinite sphere whose center is everywhere... and whose circumference is nowhere.
Well, how can the center be everywhere if --
- She just dove into the back of Angela' s car.
- You gotta keep using the method.
I gotta check on -- on, uh, Mr. Corn right now, okay?
That method works.
Don' t forget to use it, all right?
Jimbo, everything on this lawn goes.
The microwave, the coffee grinder.
Baby, come on.
Don' t do this, please.
Hey, don' t do this.
- You don' t need anyone.
- That' s not true.
I need you guys.
If nothing matters, how can I matter?
I don' t know if nothingness matters or somethingness matters.
I' m trying to figure that out and I want you to help me.
Somethingness, nothingness.
You know what?
I- I- I -- You figure it out.
Let go!
Let go of me!
Okay?
She won' t stay and share this with me.
- T- Tell me what that is.
- It' s important to me.
I see it so clearly.
- Yeah?
- You use petroleum, you' re a murderer.
That' s a fact.
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Murderer.
A murderer?
One -- killin 'the ozone and all the creatures that it' s hurting?
- Calm down.
- Two -- killing Arabs in oil - producing dictatorships... where everybody is poor -- that is cruelty and it' s inhumane.
- You' ve talked to me about this.
- So if this world is temporary...
- Yeah. - identity is an illusion...
- No.
It -- - That' s got me very confused.
It matters.
It matters.
Look, Tommy.
See, this is the universe.
And that' s our galaxy over here.
- What universe?
Tommy, come on.
Come on.
There' s dust and gas there.
- Yeah?
- There' s us over here... and good and bad luck in the middle.
- That' s chaos.
- This doesn' t sound like you.
- No, Vauban talks about space.
- Where' d you get that book?
- You sent it to me.
- No, no.
We would never give you this book.
- You didn' t send this?
- Caterine Vauban' s full of shit.
What is she doing here?
God, she never leaves Paris.
This is insane.
- This is a pretty good book.
You should read this.
- What?
She says nothing' s connected, doesn' t matter what you do... you can drive a car, you can burn up gas...
- Yeah? - which would explain the way things actually are... where people do destructive things like it doesn' t matter.
Tommy, Tommy, everything is connected and everything matters.
There' s not an atom in our bodies... that has not been forged in the furnace of the sun.
Huh?
- Yes.
- That' s a cool thing, isn' t it?
- But --
But what?
You tell me where she contradicts that.
- Oh, right here.
- Where?
Where?
- There -- - Where?
"Less than 5% of the cosmos is composed of the same elements that compose human life."
- You know -- - There you go.
That means we' re all alone... and we' re miserable and isolated.
Molly, if you -- Listen.
If you --
If you leave him before he gets done dismantling... he will never make it to the other side, okay?
You know what?
I' m done with the dismantling.
- You don' t want to ask these questions?
I want to live my life!
What is that life, baby?
What are we part of?
Who are we?
Look at this.
Do you know where these come from?
- Yeah, my closet.
- Indonesia.
- The store.
- Baby, this is the truth, okay?
Little girls like you, they have to work in dark factories... where they go blind for $1. 60 a month just to make Mommy her pretty shoes.
- Can you imagine that, Caitlin?
- I don' t want the children to work in factories!
Daddy is crazy.
Daddy' s not crazy, baby.
The world is crazy.
- [Caitlin]
Don' t let them go blind.!
Mommy doesn' t ask 'cause Mommy doesn' t care.
- Don' t stop asking questions, baby.
- Damn you!
- How dare you!
- Skippy, put her in the car, will ya?
- "Less than 5% of the cosmos...
- Give me the teddy! is composed of the same elements that compose human life. "
- What does that matter?
- You should be asking these questions, Skip.
Guys, give him a break.
His therapist is down here to help him out.
Excuse me.
What did you call me?
- You' re his therapist?
- No, I' m -- not his therapist.
We need to talk 'cause this book is making a lot of sense to me and I want --
And what is Caterine Vauban doing in the United States?
What the hell are you talking about?
- [Man]
This is really good.
You think that' s funny?
I got a story for you.
- Wait.
Wait.
Listen.
Listen.
Listen to the master, all right?
I' m with Shania.
We' re opening a megastore down by the loop.
Shania' s there promoting her apparel, right?
It' s 4: 00 and she' s starving.
So I order a ton of tuna fish sandwiches, no mayo.
- [Laughter]
Shania hates mayo, all right?
And she can' t eat chicken salad.
That' s no joke, all right?
We gave it to her once, she threw up in the limo.
- She' s vomiting all over the limo.
- The lady hates chicken salad.
So I bring out a bunch of tuna fish sandwiches.
She still doesn' t believe me.
I say, "Shania, I' m allergic to mayo."
- Which, by the way, is a lie.
- He loves mayo.!
He loves it.
Shania still doesn' t believe me so I eat two of the sandwiches in front of her to prove it.
So she eats one and a half sandwiches.
One and a half sandwiches... before she realizes... it' s chicken salad.
- And she actually likes it.
- She did not vomit.
He made her change her mind.
And that' s what they want upstairs in corporate, okay?
Excuse me?
Can I help you?
- [Woman]
Yes, I' m here for the Open Spaces meeting with Brad Stand.
Come on.
- I' il show you where to go.
- You' re very, very helpful.
Thanks a lot.
There' s no reason for you to be up here.
This is an executive private floor.
It' s for -- Come on.
Let' s pick it up.
Heel to toe.
Unless you' re an executive or an executive' s assistant... or someone who is a --
No.
No, ma' am.
Shania has no song for you.
Let' s move it along this way.
You' re supposed to be on another floor.
Security is very tight in this building.
Or at least I thought it was very tight in this building.
Of course, every now and then we get somebody... who gets off on the wrong floor.
And then people flitting about --
At Huckabees, the everything store.
Let me try that one more time.
Tops and mops.
50% off all women' s shirts and hair products.
This week only.
At Huckabees, the everything store.
Uh, Dawn, can we do it one more time?
I think we can do it better.
I really sucked.
- You' re doing great, Dawn.
I can' t do it.
- Don' t give me that face.
I don' t know what' s wrong with me.
Your voice is the trademark voice of Huckabees.
Oh, there she is.!
You' re one sneaky lady.
I was almost in the elevators.
We' re going now.
Let' s move it along.
There we go.
I' il show you where you need to go.
Moved my meeting to the Huckabees corporation.
I saved this rock.
I' m going to save this place.
They' re not gonna save this place.
Rat- fucking- bastard Brad Stand.
Corporate prick bastard.
Oh, motherfucking dickhead.
"Betrayed" by Albert Markovski.
Is it possible for anybody in this world to work together to make it better?
I don' t think so.
It was Albert' s vision.
This whole thing was Albert' s vision.
Tell me about Brad.
Albert let him in, which was a mistake.
- [Angela]
He has been enormously helpful -- [Man]
He dropped Albert' s poems from the benefit.
And the mailing.
Settle down.
Someone tell me about the woods and the marsh.
MaryJane, this is your story.
Why don' t you do it?
My great grandfather owned the woods and the marsh.
We deeded them over to the municipality in 1 97 2.
In perpetuity for the public.
- Tell me why.
- We just wanted to share this beautiful place.
And now the town is looking at subclauses.
- All of the sudden wants yet another mall... and houses on this beautiful marsh.
- So we' re fighting it.
- We are fighting it.
- We have to save the marsh.
- Sorry I' m late, guys.
I got the photo of the wetlands right here!
It looks beautiful!
Here' s the marsh and woods we' re going to save.
This photo says good times and peace.
Shania' s right here.
No silly poetry.
Let the beauty speak for itself.
This is where the littlejack- in- the- pulpits live.
An image is always better.
You' ve gotta reach people quick.
They don' t understand poems.
They don' t want to hear poems.
They have no time for them.
They think too much.
Open Spaces T' s for everyone.
MaryJane.
- Extra small for your grandson, right?
- You shouldn' t have.
Open Spaces T' s and here is the schedule for the benefit.
Dirst up, cocktails.
Then, MaryJane... you introduce the marsh video, background story, animals, plants and stuff.
Angela, you speak.
Marty speaks for Huckabees.
Then Shania sings.
Shania Twain entertains us.
- No.
Vivian Jaffe.
- Brad Stand.
She' s a perspective from --
- [Group Groaning]
- Sorry, that' s not gonna work.
- What' s the matter with that?
- How are you connected?
- Through an investigation.
I worry about that guy.
He alienates people.
What kind of investigation?
Existential.
I' d like to ask a few questions if you don' t mind.
Actually we do.
We do because we' ve got to meet, and we' re a little late.
Sounds kind of interesting though.
Have you got a card?
- Yes.
- I don' t mean to give you a hard time.
Existential?
Is that like a therapy?
Okay, let' s go, sneaky lady.
Let' s step it outside.
I told you to stay away from my work situation.!
To solve your coincidence, we have to put it into context.
Brad Stand seems very important.
So you come by Huckabees corporate and say you' re my fucking existential detectives?
- I' m lucky if I last another day!
- We can solve your case sooner if you' re straight with us.
I' m being straight with you.
Brad smeared me... and took the coalition in a different direction.
- That' s straight.
- At Schottinger' s photo archive where you met Mr. Nimieri --
Who' s Mr. -- Who' s that?
- The African guy.
- That' s the African guy from my coincidence.
- This is what I wanna talk about.
- It wasn' t your first time at Schottinger' s, was it?
- Did I say it was?
- You did.
Sure.
It wasn' t my first time.
It was more like a regular thing with you.
And you weren' t finding a still of Bob Dylan.
You were planting photos of yourself in the archive.
- What are you getting at?
- Why would you do something like that?
To be noticed.
Maybe urgently.
- Uh- huh.
How did that affect things with Brad at the coalition?
How did it affect things at the coalition?
I don' t know.
You know, it was a drag.
It really was a drag.
Because I wanted my poems to go out with the fund- raiser mailing.
Brad didn' t.
He was all obsessed with Shania and Pete Sampras.
Not what we were really supposed to be focusing on -- hurt.
You planted photos of yourself and your poems at Schottinger' s.
Brad didn' t respect you.
- No, he didn' t.
- And yet you brought him into the open spaces coalition.
- Why is that?
- I needed the sponsor to take my cause to another level.
That' s why.
Why else would I do it?
- Like we said.
To be noticed.
- This is absurd.
Show me my folder.
- No.
That is not productive.
looking at old Jessica Lange bathing suit stills, why?
That' s only because Lange comes before Markovski.
I was putting my head shots under Markovski, and then "L" is right before it.
I might' ve looked at a little bit of Lange on the way out.
What' s the big deal?
- Albert, baby, come on.
- What, is it a crime?
Is it a crime to look at Lange?
Have you ever been in love?
- What kind of question is that?
- Do you even believe in love?
- Or do you only have fantasy relationships... because anything else would be too painful?
Bernard, excuse me.
But I' m making some progress here.
So am I, darling.
So am I.
Oh, no, no.
I' m not going in that thing.
Every time I go in there... it' s all hating faces that I have to chop up with a machete.
And then they multiply.
And we' re going to address that right now.
- Okay?
- I' il leave it to you.
Come on.
You can' t retreat.
Back into the fray, Albert.
Let' s go.
I' m in your corner.
Okay, Albert, I want you to melt your usual identity like you did before.
- Stop looking at me.
I said stop looking at me.
- Dawn is gonna love doing spots for the open spaces.
- Who' s Dawn?
Miss Huckabees.
Dawn.
The one about the rock.
- Nobody sits like this rock sits.
That' s the one.
She loves forests, meadows, getting outside.
We' il just throw theJet Skis on the trailer and head to the mountains.
Wait, you guys -- You go with MissHuckabees?
- She was doing some print work for us -- - [Bernard]
Albert?
Albert?
Forget Brad.
Come back to me.
Where are you?
Where are you?
Albert.
Picture a tree in a field.
Good.
Now put someone you respect in the tree.
- [Albert]
Still Brad Stand.
- Add someone else.
- Like who?
You know, someone who can understand things.
Someone who can help you.
- Who' s your guide?
- Well, I use Magritte, a Belgian surrealist.
- I got someone.
- Who is it?
Mrs. Schirmir.
She was my high school English teacher.
She helped me.
- All right, good.
- He pushed her out of the tree.
Okay, Mrs. Schirmir has a vacuum cleaner, Albert, that sucks up fear.
Now she' s going to send you rays of security and complete acceptance.
He chopped her head off!.
Hold on.
Hold on.
You' re doing well.
Now, don' t give up now.
Didn' t she vacuum a lot?
But then he vacuumed her.
I had to chop him up with a machete.
Okay, Albert.
I can let you in on a couple of secrets.
One, your mind is always occupied on something... so it may as well be something helpful like Mrs. Schirmir and her vacuum cleaner.
Two, there is no such thing as you and me.
So then there' s just nothing?
Three, there' s no such thing as nothing.
There is no remainder in the mathematics of infinity.
There' s only the blanket.
I thought I understood the blanket.
Now I' m not sure.
Flags and bags.!
Huckabees says, "Happy birthday, Mr. President." 50% off all knapsacks and pocketbooks.
Oh, say, can you see how good this looks?
Let freedom ring.
At Huckabees... the everything store.
"Huckabees cornucopia of stuff we all want.
"But what happened to the gazelles?
Were they squashed... under the CD department? "
- Hey, Albert, how' s it goin '?
- What are you doing here, Brad?
I met Brad when I was investigating you.
He called with his own existential conundrum.
That' s all.
- I' m really glad I found out about these people.
- That' s bullshit.
He doesn' t care about things like this.
Bring me the African guy.
Where' s that African guy?
- Dude, what' re you talking about?
- Why does he get to write poetry?
There' s no gazelles in North America.
Just so you know.
And that building squashing nature is my imagery.
You don' t write poetry.
Everyone' s intake procedure is different.
I asked Brad to write a poem.
And it wasn' t enough that you came to my coalition... now you have to come here and do -- Okay, okay.
All right, that' s good.
We' re the same, Brad.
It' s all the blanket.
There you go.
Give it a shot.
- That is wonderful, Albert.
- Oh, honey, he' s got it.
How are things at the coalition, Brad?
Great.
Much smoother.
Great, I look forward to coming back and working with you.
I don' t think that' s going to happen, my friend.
I' m still in the charter.
I built the coalition from scratch.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I don' t want to cramp you here.
That' s what you mean to do.!
That' s exactly what you mean to do.!
- What?
- What?
- What?
You see what he' s doing?
Tell them what you' re doing.
- What?
- He' s come here to conquer you like he conquered my coalition.
And now he' s here today to unnerve me so that when Orrin comes to town, I will blow it.
- That' s what you mean to do.
- Albert, please.!
- Oh, my God, Brad.
You' re killing me.
- What are you talking about?
What am I talking -- Okay, when Orrin comes, I' il blow it.
I' il get kicked out, and then he can do whatever he wants with the coalition.
- Who' s Orrin?
- Orrin is the Open Spaces national director.
He' s coming to review our charter.
I hope this isn' t about Dawn.
He has a crush on my girlfriend.
- That' s crazy!
- Why do you stare at her?
- [Brad Laughs]
- I' m going home.
- Oh, no.!
Stay with us for mancala hour.
I' m gonna have a fucking ball at mancala hour, aren' t I?
Maybe Albert should meet his other.
What?
Tommy?
No, that' s a bad idea right now.
Yes, a dicey move.
Maybe even dangerous, but potentially inspired.
Bernard, give them both a connection.
Maybe, but Tommy' s in a bad direction.
It could spread to Albert.
You said Tommy was gonna be fine.
What are you leaving out?
Nothing.
Give him his other.
It' s an inspired idea.
It' s groovy.
The connection will come back to us, Bernard.
- It all comes around.
Like you say, take the long view.
- Long view.
- What' s the other?
Shh.
- [Woman Continues]
- [Woman Continues]
No olives.
No soul of life.
No rabbit in the oven.
We mashed locusts and made bread.
I have no idea what you guys are talking about.
I thought we were going to talk about petroleum.
Mrs. Echevarria visits us once a year from Spain.
She' s sort of a little treat for our clients.
A kind of spiritual petit four.
Something that would be useful for you to be accustomed to.
- Yeah, a real treat.
- You have received your answer.
like the drought or the olives or any of that.
It was created by people, and this is the facts.
It was created by people who act like nothing' s happening...
- and that' s causing all the problems.
- No, no, Tommy.
- One question only.
Uno.
- Okay.
- Here' s the question -- - No, no.
I think --
You' ve had your question and the answer, Tommy, please.
Senora is tired.
Senorita, why do people only ask themselves deep questions... when something really bad happens?
Then they forget all about it after.
Right?
How come people are self- destructive?
And third, I refuse to use petroleum... but there' s no way I can stop its use in my lifetime, is there?
Jimmy Carter would have a great electric car by now.
I could have a Cadillac Escalade, and it would be electric.
- I wouldn' t have to ride on my bicycle.
- That is three questions.
So just give me a second.
I know, dear boy.
We wanted you to meet Albert.
- I thought you said next week.
- It turns out he can use a connection sooner than later.
Tommy has been working with us since that --
The big September thing.
He' s going to be your other.
- What is it exactly?
- Like a buddy system I think.
And it helps... to have a friend going through the same.
Do you drive a car?
A bike.
Sometimes I take the bus.
Good.
That' s good.
I like that.
I can see why they put us together.
- Tommy Corn.
- Albert Markovski.
- I' il be your other.
Join us for mancala hour.
Come.
Gracias, senora.
- [Spanish]
- What' s happening with your case?
- I don' t know.
- What do you mean?
- They won' t let me see my coincidence file.
You want them to solve a coincidence?
That' s why you came here?
- Yeah, that' s why I came here.
- Who' s the girl?
The face of Huckabees.
- Tops and mops?
- That' s her.
- I doubt your coincidence is meaningful.
- Why?
I have a book by a Drench thinker named Caterine Vauban.
She says the same thing they say here about dismantling your reality to see the big picture.
- What' s the difference?
- Here, they say everything' s connected in the blanket.
Vauban says nothing' s connected.
It' s all random and cruel.
It doesn' t matter what you do.
That' s nihilism, Tommy!
They find it threatening.
But it is very convincing.
You know, my ex- girl won' t let me see my daughter.
She' s brainwashing her not to think or feel.
- What kind of reality is that?
- Not this one.
Exactly.
I think you shouldjust look in your file if you want to.
- How am I gonna look at my file?
- You wanna see your file?
I' il distract them.
You slip in for it.
Act naturally.
Here comes your boy.
Hey, you play mancala?
Didn' t know you were interested in existential issues, Brad.
Why?
'Cause I' m a dumb sales executive instead of a sensitive artist like you?
No, I just never heard you talk about it.
That' s all.
Why do you think I joined the Open Spaces Coalition, man?
- I thought you cared about the issues.
- I do.
Obviously you had a different agenda, didn' t you?
- What books do you read?
- What books do I read?
PhilJackson' s Sacred Hoops.
Really.
I read the galleys when it arrived at Huckabees, and you know what?
Seriously, that book' s got some good questions.
You should read it.
[Laughs]
No, wise ass.
PhilJackson' s a smart guy.
All right, come on.
It was an honest question, Brad.
Delt a little hostile.
I feel the same thing from him.
- Who the hell are you?
- Who the hell are you?
You wanna go?
Get out of here man.
Hey, don' t be a jerk, buddy.
Don' t be a --
- That' s funny!
He pushed him!
- It is not funny!
- Hey, he assaulted me, man.
He tried to attack me.
- Hey!
- I tried to -- You' re dancing with my girl.
- Yeah.
- You wanna dance?
- No, I don' t wanna dance.
Look at me.
- What?
- You want to go at him, right?
- Yeah.
No, I don' t want to go.
He grabbed my girl.
All right, you guys wanna have a go at each other, right?
[Continues, Indistinct]
You want to go backwards?
The reptiles have been eating each other for years.
You want to be back on all fours?
Right?
Primitive?
Come on.!
That' s spirit you wanna keep for the battles inside.
What are you doing?
- I, um --
Bernard -- The dismantling thing with the whole -- You know, all the poetry stuff --
But I got it.
It' s no big deal.
Because I got it now, okay?
Every relationship is possible, guys.
Brothers, husbands, child.
Security breach.
He broke into his file.
- What did you do, Albert?
This is my investigation now.!
You think you know what you' re doing?
You haven' t even begun... to dismantle your identity or your fear.
Albert' s gotta do what he' s gotta do.
Anybody think they know better?
- Want to take a shot?
It' s my coincidence.
[Tommy]
Yeah, nobody.
Sorry I grabbed you.
Reptilian.
- Man, come on.
- Hey, is that him there?
- Yeah, that' s him.
- Hey.
- My goodness, it is you.
Yeah, it' s me Albert.
How are you?
This is my friend Tommy.
Tommy Corn.
How are you?
- This is the fourth coincidence?
- No, I came here on purpose.
I was wondering about our coincidences and what they mean.
We were just wondering if we spent time, maybe try to understand it.
- Perhaps you can be my guests for dinner.
- That would be great, huh?
- Yeah, that' d be great.
I must ask my mom.
Guys, guys.!
My ball.!
My ball.!
Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses... as we forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.
Dorever and ever, Amen.
Amen.
Steven, how' d you end up working as a doorman?
It is our immigration agreement.
We must work.
The building supervisor hired Steven as a member of our congregation.
- He was so skinny.
- Skeleton man from Africa.
Skeleton man --
- What did we say about that?
- I don' t want to hear it again.
It' il be no Internet tonight.
Didn' t know what a can opener was.
He opened cans with a big knife like at the camp.
There aren' t lions roaming here but there were in Sudan, and the orphan boys got chased.
- [Boy]
It was a crocodile.
He wanted to know where all the meat comes from since he didn' t see any cows.
Guys, that' s enough.!
Albert, what brought you to the philosophical club?
You mean the existential detectives?
- Sounds like a support group.
- Why can' t he use a church?
Sometimes people have additional questions to be answered.
- Like what?
If the forms of this world die, which is more real... the me that dies or the me that' s infinite?
Can I trust my habitual mind or do I need to learn to look beneath those things?
Sounds like we got a philosopher.
We don' t have to ask those kinds of questions, do we, Mom?
- No, honey.
- What happened to the cat, Albert?
H- How' d you know about my cat?
- The cat was killed by curiosity.
- Right.
That cat.
- What do you do?
- I' m the director of the Open Spaces Coalition.
- We fight suburban sprawl.
- What' s suburban sprawl?
Ask Steven.
He could have used a little suburban sprawl in Sudan.
Excuse me, Dad?
Industry, houses, jobs, restaurants, medicine --
You can preserve a lot of open spaces and have jobs for people with --
- I beg your pardon, Albert.
I wasn' t finished.
Clothes, videos, toys, cheeseburgers, cars, a functioning economy.
You can still have a functioning economy and preserve open spaces with a little planning.
- Yeah.
- Socialism.
Complete disaster.
- Theodore Roosevelt was a socialist?
And Yeats?
- Theodore Roosevelt --
Henry David Thoreau, Robinson Jeffers, the National Geographic Society, all socialists?
- No, I' m not.
I' m talking about... not covering every square inch with houses and strip malls... until you can' t remember what happens when you stand in a meadow at dusk.
- What happens in the meadow at dusk?
- Everything.
- Nothing!
- Everything!
- It' s beautiful.
- It' s beautiful.
I work for an electrical engineering firm, son.
We do a lot of commercial and residential contracts.
If development stops, so does my paycheck.
So your ideas hurt Steven.
I' m not hurting Steven.
That' s an outrageous accusation.
- Don' t use that tone of voice in my house.
- I think you started that tone.
And I think it' s entirely possible for your engineering firm to have jobs for people... preserve open spaces, have contracts, do the --
- What' s he doing?
- Why' s he closing his eyes?
Cricket, I don' t know.
- Do you have a job, Tom?
- I' m a firefighter.
Oh, God bless you.
A hero.
I' m not a hero.
We' d all be heroes if we quit using petroleum though.
- Excuse me?
Are you?
Jesus is never mad at us if we live with him in our hearts.
I hate to break it to you, but he is.
He most definitely is.
All right.
That' s enough.
Steven, I don' t know what this is about.
Why they' re here --
- Sorry, Mom.
Sorry, Dad.
I did not know.
- Stevo, I' m so disappointed.
It' s all right.
Look, he' s sad.
He' s sad.
I' m sorry, Stevo.
My bad.
You didn' t know.
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- I should be what?
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- Why should I be ashamed?
- You' re a hypocrite.
- I' m a what?
You' re misleading these children.
'Cause you' re the destroyer, man.
- How am I the destroyer?
- I saw that S. U. V. out there.
My car' s the destroyer?
You wanna know how many miles per gallon I get?
Steven, I need to ask a question.
It' s why I came here.
Why are autographs so important to you?
It is a pastime with this family which they have taught me.
- [Woman]
It' s just for fun.
- [Game Beeping]
No games at the table, please.
260.
And I' ve reached the omega level.
Destroyer.
Destroyer.
Destroyer.
God gave us oil.!
He gave it to us.!
How can God' s gift be bad?
He gave you a brain too and you messed that up pretty good --
I want you sons of bitches out of my house now.
If Hitler were alive, he' d tell you not to think about oil.
You' re the Hitler!
We took a Sudanese refugee into our home!
You did.
But how did Sudan happen, ma' am?
Could it possibly be related to dictatorships... that we support for some stupid reason?
- You shut up!
You get out.
Come on.
Let' s get out of here.
- Later, Steve.
- God bless you.
- Wow.
- What' s going on in there?
- Crazy.
- I can' t believe them.
- Hi, guys.
- Oh, Christ.
You guys get anything good in there?
You didn' t, did you?
You hesitated over the mention of a cat.
What does that mean?
- It means nothing. Just like my coincidence.
- Cat seemed to hit a nerve.
Yeah, I had a cat once.
You caught me.
You' re amazing.
The method worked.
I saw it.
It seemed to calm you down, right?
What method?
Come on with that method.
That' s a tranquilizer so people don' t get pissed... about the painful, ugly truth -- you know it.
No, Tommy.
It penetrates a unified infinity of everything.
We' re not in infinity.
We' re in the suburbs.
Infinity is everywhere.
That' s what makes it infinity.
Okay, how does this connect?
Mr. Nimieri' s an orphan from Sudan... who was chased by soldiers and crocodiles.
- How does the love glow fit into that, man?
- It' s connected.
Albert and Mr. Nimieri share a great deal.
It' s just that --
Oh, my God.
What' s she doing here?
That' s Caterine.
- This is worse than I thought.
- Oh, it' s much worse.
The meeting' s going down at Huckabees right now.
Let' s go.
- Hey, everybody.
Calm down.
The national office recognizes the charter.
We' re here today to give the director a chance to even the keel.
- So just give him a break.
- Thank you, Orrin.
- Okay, first director now.
Silence.
- Excuse me.
Dirst, I would like to apologize for my part of the fight... that I had with Brad Stand a little while ago over the poems... that did not go out with the Shania mailing.
- Where' s Brad?
- Brad.
Brad.
Brad.
It' s all Brad, Brad.
The big benefit' s coming up with Brad... and Brad' s running it and it' s going to go great.
So, look, we' re overlooking our core issues.
Brad is not here.
- So to get us back on track...
I have a new poem I' d like to read.
Point of order, please.
Apoint of order.
I want to discuss this strategy of poems, which are getting us nowhere.
Ma' am.
Poems are amazing, okay?
They will help you and your mind transform.
Who the hell are you?
I' m with Albert.
It will help you... to transform your mind into thinking differently.
- You guys need this, okay?
This is great.
- Where' s Brad?
This is called 'An Open Meadow. "
"An open meadow, an open marsh in a cloudless sky.
- [Girl]
- A crane flies. "
- Oh, Brad' s here.!
Look what I got you, MaryJane.
- Oh, is that for my grandson?
- It most certainly is.
I' m talking here.
Shit.
You know what?
Let me just finish reading my poem... and then we' il review our strategy, okay?
- Good job, Albert.
- Can it be taped?
Excuse me, Brad.
I would like to finish reading my poem, please.
Thank you.
Not doing your poem.
- Don' t give me the relax thing, Brad.
Let him read the poem, man.
He was in the middle of it.
He has no right to be here and no right to speak.
No, ma' am, I' m not a member, but I am a local firefighter.
He' s a great firefighter and exactly who we want on our side.
I don' t know who these men are.
They' re not members of our coalition.
They' re working on the benefit.
They' re bringing a lot of support for our cause.
- Conflict is an illusion.
- Shut up, Brad.
Hey, Albert, that' s not the way a director behaves.
Why are you guys wasting all your time fighting each other?
Serious.
Put the egos aside for a second, guys, please.
Deal with this issues, okay.
We have a deadly petroleum situation, not to mention --
- [Group Booing, Hissing]
Shut --
- [Mouths Words]
Civil war in Africa.
Toxic fish.
You have children in your own community going to prison.
Dather Dlavin doesn' t have the money to help them.
Ma' am, listen to me.
- [Applause]
Killing us dead.
Our mission has nothing to do... with this nut' s petroleum fixation.
- What did you just call me?
- Cystic toxic what?
America wants to drive cars, right?
I have a B. M. W. S. U. V.
And I like driving it.
I' m sorry.
Excuse me.
You got to give me a chance, all right?
- This is my meeting.
I' m the director.
- We gave you a chance.
- You' re out of the charter.
- He can' t be out of the charter.
He is the charter.
- I wrote it.
- Marty, call security.
I think you should call --
- I move to vote.
- Second!
All in favor of Brad becoming the new leader of the coalition, say aye.
- [Group]
- Hey, come on.
- That' s bullshit.
- Congratulations.
Be strong.
Be strong 'cause you' re going to be back.
Don' t worry about those people.
They don' t appreciate you.
Albert, what happened in there is reality.
It' s cruelty and it' s chaos.
The detectives are wrong.
What were you trying to do?
You were trying to do a good thing, right?
Well, look what happened.
I' m going to the other side, Albert.
I seriously suggest... you consider coming with me... as my other.
- Albert -- - You' re wrong!
- You' re full of shit.
You guys got nothing to offer, man.
- Tommy, no --
Yes?
- No.!
You know how hurt you feel?
This is the perfect opportunity to dismantle now.
- Stay away from me!
- Stop!
Listen!
Throughout infinity... your energy recycles into every possible relation... to everyone else' s energy, even Brad' s.
You' ve been predator and prey with him.
Driends, enemies, brother, sister, mother, child.
I give and I give and I give... and he takes and he takes and he takes.
- Mama.
- All right, baby.
All right.
- It' s a romantic fantasy.
And you left that part out, okay?
When you were taking my cash.
I want it back.
Yeah, and if I wasn' t pro bono, I' d want my money back too.
Send it to my ex for my kids.
- Hey, sign your bike out.
Sign your bike out!
- Tommy, come on!
Go!
I' il block for you.
Cocksucker!
Motherfucking bitch ass motherfucking cocksucker!
You' re all a bunch of big babies!
Maybe I should just quit.
I mean, what' s the point of life anyway?
I can answer these questions for you.
You can?
Because I don' t think the other guys are doing such a hot job.
Believe me, I can.
You' re the writer Tommy' s into?
Are you unhappy with their work?
Yeah, I' m ready to cross over to your side.
- Tell me about your case.
- Well, you seem to be following me pretty closely.
- Why don' t you tell me about it?
- You are miserable.
Obsessed with your strange coincidence.
Yeah.
Yeah, but they just want to talk about Brad Stand.
They betrayed you, as he did.
- That' s right.
- Betrayal embodies the universal truth you seek.
What truth?
Cruelty, manipulation... meaninglessness.
Yeah.
- Did they follow you?
I lost them on Route 4.
- Thanks for helping me out back there.
- No problem.
Glad you' re here, Albert.
This is the place to be.
Once you realize the universe sucks, you got nothing to lose.
- That' s what gives you la force.
- The force?
- La force.
It' s Drench for strength.
- La force.
You guys got a method here?
Yeah.
Deconstruct your mind to the blackness, okay?
Nothing.
There' s no glowing guys, no infinite mothers.
None of that bullshit.
My coincidence is meaningless, isn' t it?
Think, Albert.
Have you betrayed yourself?.
Wait a second.
What are we doing here?
Stop!
- [Tommy]
Trust her, Albert.
- This is for you.
- Oh, thank you.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- No, stay away from me.
- I don' t want to talk to you.
- Thanks, Steven.
- Well, this is a rare occasion.
- Where is she?
- Who?
- Caterine.
- Who' s Caterine?
- The woman who' s spying on me.
Where is she?
I don' t think this is funny.
Oh, God, here we go again.
What' s happening?
He' s just making a joke on me.
- Are you making fun of your mother?
- No.
Why can' t you get along with her?
- So, how' s your poetry job?
- I got fired from it.
Oh, couldn' t even hold down a poetry job.
Brenda, what the hell did you do?
- I didn' t touch it.
Bullshit!
I have this programmed on my favorite stations on a timer.
Can I please have some time with my son?
I want to show him an article I have here on marketing internship.
- That' s great, Mom.
It' s right up my alley.
- But it is.
It' s a new hot --
- I sent this to you.
Why don' t you ever listen to me -- - Have you seen this system?
State of the art.
We got speakers all through the house.
- [Country]
- It' il be easier to talk now.
- Where did she come from?
- What' s going on?
- See, I wasn' t making a joke.
- What' s her name?
I would like to discuss some curious findings.
- Who is this lady?
- I found here in your apartment... a rather troubling piece of evidence.
What evidence?
- Do you recognize the handwriting, Mr. Markovski --
- [Albert]
This is silly.
Let' s go.
No.
- I wanna go.
- Could you please read the date for me?
Albert was nine.
This is his journal.
Would you mind reading this out loud?
- No.
- Please.
This stuff doesn' t matter.
Let' s go.
Oh, my God.
"I came home from school.
Mom was in the kitchen with a strange lady.
"Mom told me to go back to my room.
I thought I was in trouble.
"She closed my door and said, 'Purree got hit by a car and killed.'
'And then she took me back to the lady in the kitchen...
"and told me to spell words to show how I' m a good speller.
"I said I had to go to the bathroom.
"I climbed out the window.
I went down the block.
"I saw Barney playing punch ball.
He said I look sad.
"I told him what happened to my cat.
He said, 'That' s sad.'
"Then I cried, but I tried not to show.
Some of the kids laughed.
Barney said he cried when his dog died.
And the kids stopped laughing. "
His cat died.
He was sad.
What' s your point?
- Nothing strikes you as odd?
- See?
It' s nothing.
Let' s go.
These things happen.
Oui.
C' est vrai.
The universe is cruel.
But tell me this, Mrs. Silver, this lady you gave the coffee to --
I don' t remember her name.
I met her the once.
Was there some painful thing about this stranger... that required your immediate attention?
No.
Helen wasn' t home, so I offered her sister a cup of coffee.
But you agree that Purree meant a great deal to Albert?
You can' t make a federal case out of the cat.
Answer the question, please.
I don' t know much about the cat.
I traveled a lot for work.
We' re not talking about this anymore.
It' s embarrassing me.
- [Brenda]
What?
You were embarrassed for feeling sad about the death of your cat.
It' s painful enough to feel sad, but on top of it... to feel embarrassed for feeling, that is the killer.
How is that my fault?
I didn' t tell him to be embarrassed.
But you did.
It was more important to have a cup of coffee... with a perfect stranger than to talk to Albert...
- about what for a small boy is a large tragedy.
- This is ridiculous.
He climbed out his window, a criminal in his own house.
- Why?
- I don' t know.
- I think you do.
- I don' t.
- Yes, you do.
- Oh, stop it!
- I think you should go.
- No, I will not go.
Albert has a place here, a place you have denied.
This is my home.
I can tell him what I want.
- Yes, your home is a lie.
- What does that mean?
I gave my life to this selfish bas --
So he could be an ornament to you, not a person.
- God, what are you, a bitch?
You' re a bitch.
How many kids do you have, bitch?
Listen.
Listen.
This is your mother.
- You asked me to come up here?
- What does the doorman have to do with this?
He was orphaned by civil war.
You were orphaned by indifference.
This is but one part of your puzzle.
Do you see?
Oh, now the timer' s all fucked up.
Brenda.!
Gee, is it that hard?
Go ahead and do it.
- All I' m gonna do is listen -- - I spent what?
I spent $2, 000 on this?
I wanna listen to a radio!
Thanks.
We' il meet you later by the rock.
I' m sorry, man.
I need, like, a minute to figure this out.
- She had to get you to see.
- See what?
You were trained to betray yourself right here.
That' s why you betrayed yourself by going to Brad.
Why didn' t you figure this out?
Why didn' t you bring me here?
Because you lied to us.
You told us that the African guy... was the -- the doorman at your friend' s building, not at your parents' building.
You encrypted the truth.
That' s how good you are at betraying yourself.
- Right.
- I told you that he wasn' t ready for infinity.
- Don' t start with that magic blanket bullshit, okay?
- It' s not magic.
It' s just the way things are.
You and me and the air are actually tiny particles... that are swirling around together.
- Look right here.
You see?
But look at the cracks... between these particles and the cracks we fall through, the holes of nothingness.
- Exactly.
Because that' s what I just experienced upstairs.
- Look closer.
There are tiny particles connecting the larger cubes.
Yeah, and then tinier cracks between the connections.
- And even tinier connections.
- And even tinier cracks.
Yeah, but if you look close enough, you can' t tell where my nose ends... and space begins, because they' re unified.
- So what?
You can' t see any of this anyway!
- Do you see anything?
- No.
But I want to debate this particle cube thing.
You live all the time with things you can' t see.
You can' t see electricity, can you?
- You can' t see radio waves, but you accept them.
- Trust.
- Duck trust!
'cause she' s gonna lead you down the path of darkness.
She was our prize graduate student till she went astray.
I think that I am gonna stay with her, the cracks, the pain, the nothingness... because that' s more real to me, that' s what I feel.
- Word.
- Okay.
We' re not sweatin 'it.
- No, we' re gonna work with Brad.
- It' il all come back to you...
- and interconnection.
- Brad?
Are you kidding me?
I' m gonna work on that prick, and it' s all gonna come back to pain and no connection!
- No.
- It' s on.
We' il see.
Ooh, damn.
Come on.
Duck.
Oh, look at this.
Kafka.
- He' s planting garbage for us.
- Kafka.
- Kafka.
- Look at that.
So fishy.
- Ooh, she found his poem.
Oh, this is good.
I was hoping for a break like this.
- Whoa.
- I' m not unhappy to be with you!
- Let me see this!
"Putting on a show.
Can' t say no.
Inside I' m drowning, sighing and frowning. "
That doesn' t sound very happy to me.
Does it sound very happy to you?
I only wrote "frowning" to rhyme with "drowning."
- Then why did you need "drowning"?
- To rhyme with "frowning."
- There -- There' s nothing in it.
Look!
And why do they have to go through our yard and go through the garbage?
- What is he doing?
Stop that.
Why is he sniffing my blouse?
Perspiration levels indicate stress, and that' s kind of high.
- Brad signed a rather comprehensive contract... allowing unfettered access to your home.
Well, it' s my home too, and I didn' t sign anything.
You' re going to have to work that out with Brad.
The mortgage is in his name, and you' re not married.
- Are these from this year?
Last year.
We went to Saint Bart' s.
- What about this year?
- We didn' t take a trip this year.
- How come?
A lot of work.
- Too busy to go have fun?
- Hon -- Honey, why are you involved with this?
- You don' t believe in therapy.
- No, see, I don' t see this as therapy.
These people are action oriented.
It' s like the company retreats at Hilton Head.
Remember?
- No, hey.
Get out of there.
Hey!
- No.
Now, unfettered access.
- Remember last year, the trust thing?
The paragliding?
- A quick look at your label.
- It' s just like that.
- No, it' s not like that!
This is --
Actually it is.
No, it is.
Everything will end up nice.
It seemed like they were helping Albert.
They can help me.
Help the Open Spaces.
Help Huckabees.
- What are you talking about?
- He did mention that in his application... that he felt exhausted from having to constantly charm everyone... but doesn' t see any alternative because --
"You need to get people to like you to be successful to get things done in this world."
- Duh.
Brad likes to be charming.
It comes naturally.
I only put those things in the garbage as a joke.
- Yeah, see?
That' s funny.
Back door way to charm.
That' s joking as a disguised request for approval.
That' s saying, 'Joke, "but really love me.
- Joke, love me.
- Ms. Campbell, how have you felt about being pretty?
- [Indistinct]
Yes, that' s changed at Huckabees, but, you know...
I was never the pretty girl.
- Really?
- No.
I just have to keep up with this gorgeous hottie.
- How' s the sex?
- How is the sex?
- The sex?
- Come on, guys.
That' s private.
- That' s gross.
- A preliminary surveillance... indicates it' s been infrequent and short -- eight to nine minutes...
- typically.
- Surveillance?
You watched us?
- [Brad]
So, your surveillance is wrong.
Yeah.
It' s quantity, not quality.
- What?
- She meant quality, not quantity.
I was onlyjoking.
- Were you joking...
- when you said quantity and not quality?
- In regards to sex?
- We' re not gonna discuss this.
- We' re private about...
- our seven minutes of heaven.
- It' s longer than that.
Eight minutes of heaven!
It' s not quality, it' s quantity!
- You oughta see her after a couple margaritas.
- Oh, my God!
I' m crying.
- Honey -- - What is it?
Why did you have to write this poem?
How come we can' t discuss these things ourselves?
Where is this relationship going, huh?
Why is marriage and kids so important?
There' s an overpopulation problem.
- That came out of left field.
- All right.
Why is having children the ultimate performance for successful people?
Why?
Well, it doesn' t have to be a performance.
You know, we don' t have to have kids.
We could just, you know, think about it, or not.
Could just be ourselves, Jet Skiing, whatever.
This is not why I hired you.
Then why did you hire them?
- [Doorbell Ringing]
There it is.
Would you like some tea?
With a little lemon.
So, I' ve never really done anything like this before.
Um, where -- where would we start?
Now.
Now.
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.
I did.
I felt it.
It' s hard to describe.
Very, very good.
Your turn.
Now.
- Not so hard.
- Sorry.
Now.
Now.
Now!
Did you get it?
Yeah, you stop thinking.
Yes.
It' s fantastic.
It' s like I' m here, but I' m not --
So, I' m not here.
It- It' s just --
I -- I -- I don' t know.
Do it one more time.
It' s like I' m a rock or a dish of mold.
I' m whatever else is around.
So I' m free to just exist.
This is the answer.
We just have to be this all day, every day.
- That' s the answer.
- Yes.
- Do it again.
Do it again.
- Now.
Careful, my young students... you cannot stay in this state all day.
- Why not?
- Yeah, why not?
It is inevitable that you are drawn back into human drama.
Desire, suffering -- everything that exists in this imperfect world.
- Shit.
- So we get drawn back into human drama... and how important we think that is.
Then we do crazy stuff.
We have to go back to the ball... so we can get the freedom of being like a -- like a dish of mold.
Yes.
And then back to the drama, the suffering.
- It' s kind of a crappy deal.
- C' est exactement ca.
An absurd theatrical we must play out, back and forth... from pure being to human suffering.
But isn' t the drama and suffering less if we do the ball thing every day?
Call it "pure being."
Doesn' t the pure being, ball thing make the day- to- day suffering easier?
- Yeah.
- No, it doesn' t.
You' re wrong.
We' re gonna do this every day.
- We' il show you.
It' il make it easier.
- I' il prove it to you.
Human drama is inevitable.
Suffering cannot be diminished.
You cannot escape, Tommy.
You' il see.
Existence is a cruel joke... that entices in a form of desire.
- Absurd theater of desire.
- I know, buddy, it hurts.
It' s painful.
- Wait here.
- Where you goin '?
To meditate on desire and suffering.
- Can I come?
- No.
Okay.
I' il see you in a little bit.
Pain --
I hope so.
Don' t fucking leave me.
You look ugly.!
No, no, no.
- Hold up.
- No.
No.
- No, go back inside.
- Can I have my car keys?
You can' t keep coming to work if you dress like that.
Me and Daryl made some spots Marty' s gonna love.
These are the best tops around.
Last time, last year, not so good.
But now, this is the truth.
Marty' s gonna hate them, Dawn.
- He' s gonna hate them.
- There' s glass between us.
You can' t deal with my infinite nature, can you?
That is so not true.
Wait, what does that even mean?
We' ve talked about your intimacy problem.
What' s the core of it?
Intimacy is combo of infinites.
I' m definitely gonna have an intimacy problem with you if you keep dressing like that.
- Well, it' s only been a week.
- One day is too much.
The people at the office are freaking out.
You could get free, Brad, but you think you have to be Superman in control.
And that means you are the source instead of part of the infinite.
- And that makes it too hard for us, baby.
- Stop talking to me like that.
- You hired the detectives.
- You don' t have to listen to every word they say.
- How am I supposed to know which parts to listen to?
- I' il tell you.
- [Engine Starting]
- Take that off.
Take it off.
Can I have my car keys, please?
- Give me my glasses.
- Give me my glasses.
- You give me my car keys.
- No.
- Yes.
Till you dress normal... you don' t come to work.
Trees and bees --
- Hey, Daryl, where are you?
Hi, honey.
- Dawn, this is Heather.
- Hey, I' m Heather.
- Let' s do it.
- Let' s make a commercial.
- I' m a really big fan of yours.
- Well, thanks.
- It' s so weird to meet my voice.
- Welcome to the family.
What?
This script only has my lines, and I don' t see another character here.
- I told you, you are the trademark voice of Huckabees.
- So --
So what' s the problem?
- She' s the voice.
- I' m the face.
- Go, Heather.
- Girl, you could -- [Laughing]
- Yeah, yeah.
All this, and brains too.
Son of a bitch, Daryl!
- [Screams]
- Dawn, please.
- Wake up, pretty girl.
- The joke' s on you!
Ow!
- No, stop.
- Don' t look at me.
I just want to be left alone.
I' m sick of this.
I' m sick of you all looking at me.
Look at me.
Please, please, please, everybody.
Everybody look at me now.
I am so pretty.
I am so pretty.
Look at me.
Everybody just wants to be me.
I' m pretty.
- Shania' s on the stage.
- That' s great. working their way back to the, uh, lesser donators.
Well, when we did the Garth benefit in Dallas...
- we put the $1 0, 000 donors up here.
- Wow, Garth.
Was that Garth Garth, or Chris Garth?
- That' s classic Garth.
The best.
- Classic Garth costs.
Yeah, so, when we did the Garth benefit in Dallas, that' s what we --
Where' s Marty?
Where is he?
Have you even seen my commercials?
- Have you?
I' m doing this for you.
- Oh, my God.
- They' re your detectives, and they gave me this truth.
Nutty.
Do you understand?
There' s glass between us!
Don' t look at me like that.!
Hey -- - There you are, Marty.
- Why don' t you like my spots?
- Honey, this look is hurting you, and it' s hurting Huckabees.
- This is myself.
- Then you won' t speak at the benefit as yourself.
- That is not Huckabees.
- I am still Huckabees.
- Not in that bonnet.
- It' s in my eyes, Marty.
It' s like that story of the cave.
What in God' s name is happening to you?
We trusted you.
We took care of you.
We made you into a national icon.
Pulled you out of a mall.
Eh, you' ve been given everything by Huckabees.
- Ooh.
- Bradley, there' s board members here.
- She' s knocking on the glass -- - That' s not gonna look too good for a new corporate guy.
- What?
I got corporate?
- You got corporate.
- I got corporate?
- Yeah, you got corporate.
Now go and contain her.
All right?
She said, "Duck- a- bees."
- Yeah.
- She said fuck --
What are you doing?
What are you doing to us?
I' m talking to the Dixie Chicks... and they' re making me feel better.
Well, I think the Dixie Chicks would like you to know that I just got promoted.
- What?
- V. P. for public affairs.
I got corporate, Dawn.
I' m sorry you had to go through all this.
It' s for the greater good.
I went to the detectives to shake Albert out of the coalition.
- I admit that.
- This doesn' t make sense.
Sweetheart, you' re mixing yourself up.
Listen, you' re mixing it all up.
- Huh.
Do you even care about the marsh and the woods?
Yes, I care about the marsh and the woods.
Albert was not gonna save 'em his way.
You don' t go through the back door with a poem and a bonnet.
You go through the front door with a tie, and you own the marsh and the woods.
That' s how you' re gonna save 'em.
- Mm- hmm.
- You want some new clothes?
- Yeah.
- I' il get you whatever you want.
What do you need?
- I don' t know.
- Pedicure?
- Yeah, but do I have to be pretty all the time?
Well, you know, you have a choice.
But, no, it' s not a choice.
I do have to be pretty.
Well, I' m pretty sure the Dixie Chicks would want you to spread your love... here where you can at Huckabees.
Right.
That' s good.
You know what?
You got Albert fired.
Stay positive.
Bermuda. Jet Skis.
Pina coladas.
All right?
- Yeah.
- When you leave the office, will you go through the back door?
Okay?
'Cause you don' t look so good today.
Okay.
Okay.
Hey, Tom, Tom.
Go for it, man.
The woods are hopeless.
Don' t waste your time.
They will be destroyed.
So will the marsh.
It is a losing game... mankind has played for more than a century.
Sadness is what you are.
Do not deny it.
The universe is a lonely place, a painful place.
This is what we can share between us, period.
What are you doing?
You told me you were done with this stupid method.
- Why can' t I do it?
- Because it is a fantasy.
- Do you want to lead a fake life?
- You don' t have to get so threatened.
- I can mix your thing with their thing.
- No, you can' t!
- Why not?
- Because they are completely different.
And theirs is a lie.
Dor the last time, forget the tree fantasy.
- what he did to you, and -- - [Knocking]
You ditched me.
First my family, and now you guys.
- She' s my teacher too, Albert.
- And she' s still your teacher, Tom.
No.
It' s all different now.
I thought we were a platonic trio, not some sick sex dance.
You said that was bullshit.
Learn from this, Tommy.
Painful truth.
I warned you -- human drama.
Is that why you' re doing this, to teach me?
- Yeah, is that why you' re doing this, to teach him?
- Of course it is.
There are unique moments when two people share the deep sorrow of existence.
That' s what I wanted to hear.
- How can you believe that bullshit?
- T- Tom -- Tom, I' m sorry.
This just happened.
I' ve never done anything like this before.
- We could still be -- You can still be my other, right?
- Shut up, Albert.
I brought you here.
I wanted to share la force with you, and you ruined it.
- You fell in love.
Do not defile it with cliche.
- It is unnameable.
- Yeah?
Well, I reject unnameable!
It leaves me out!
Where is your pure being now, Tommy?
I told you.
I' m just gonna accept my loneliness.
And I' m gonna go to an even darker place of nothingness.
Drom an even farther, more extreme nothingness on my own!
- Who needs you guys?
Ahh, sublime.
Hey, welcome.
You like my new office?
- Let' s start with the method.
- Let' s start with the method.
- We' d like to discuss -- - We' d like to discuss --
- Okay.
- Okay.
What are you doing?
- [Chuckling]
I' m jokin 'around, guys.
But seriously, I want to quit the process with you.
Nothing personal.
I appreciate what you' ve done for me, but I' m over it.
- You can' t quit until the case is over.
- Ah, I can fire you.
- No, you can' t.
- No, you can' t.
- Sure I can.
- No, you can' t.
Paragraph 201.
"Neither client nor detective...
"may terminate case prior to resolution as defined by paragraph 31 4, subclause 'D'...
- which states -- "- That' s not binding.
- Oh, it' s binding.
- I' il find a lawyer.
- Oh?
- Or maybe even go to the DBl.
How about that?
- Go ahead.
I' m not kidding.
No, Brad, this is how it works.
You go to the police.
You -- You tell them that you went to the existential detectives.
They ask why.
You say, "For personal reasons."
Or, maybe you wanted to work the politics at your corporation...
- by rattling Albert Markovski.
- I never told you that.
- Well, give us a little credit.
- The police go to Huckabees.
They talk to them.
The board learns that rising star, Brad Stand... has weird existential issues.
- Or he fakes them.
- Which is odd.
Which is worse.
And your girlfriend, the voice of Huckabees...
- is dressing like an Amish bag lady.
- Okay, I get it.
You know, Brad, suddenly your star isn' t rising anymore.
It' s sinking.
Relax.
- Passive- aggressive.
- Shut up.
- Aggressive- aggressive.
- Does Dawn want to quit?
- Dawn' s into this crap for real... which is the stupidest thing I' ve ever seen in my life.
Shall we get back to the case?
All right.
What you got on me?
Nothin '.
Our staff did a little field work in, uh, Cleveland.
- What?
- [Vivian]
Mommy and daddy look awesome.
- So do you.
But this guy.
- Wha -- Ah, he doesn' t look too good.
- You bastards.
He doesn' t look too good, does he, Brad?
[Sniffing]
Are you kidding me?
He weighs 250.
He t -- He talks about geckos all the time.
- What' s the point?
- I thought he was a sweet, sensitive young man.
Oh, excuse me.
You -- You spoke to my fat, sad brother?
- Yes, Brad, on the phone.
- Indeed, I did, at length.
Well, if he' s so sensitive, why doesn' t he lose 7 0 pounds and stop talking about geckos.
- Maybe he' il find some friends.
- Well, your brother feels that you' re ashamed ofhim.
Are you sympathetic to him?
- Are you kidding me?
Mm- hmm.
- Mm- hmm.
I -- Look.
Here, guys.
Geckos.
And I keep 'em.
I' m a pretty good older brother.
He wishes you would listen to him more.
About what, geckos?
I -- I don' t have all the answers.
But maybe he should listen to me more and learn a little.
You have several stories that you like to tell over and over and over.
Oh- ho.
That' s a lie.
- I -- I' m not boring like him.
- Like the mayonnaise story.
The mayo story.
May 1 8, sales meeting.
Shania' s there, you know, promoting her apparel, right?
- [Man Chuckles]
She' s starving.
She hates mayonnaise, right?
Allergic to it.
So I order a ton of tuna fish sandwiches.
Back then that' s all she' s eating.
No mayo, darling.
- [People Laughing]
June 5, driving range.
[Brad' s Voice]
We gave her a chicken salad sandwich once... she threw up in the back of the limo.
June 30, the lake.
Shania' s there promoting her apparel, right?
It' s 4: 00, and she' s starving.
She' s a busy lady.
I order a ton of tuna fish sandwiches.
That' s all she' s eating back then, tuna fish.
July 9, Flight 2 7 to Chicago.
Shania' s there promoting her apparel, right?
It' s 4: 00.
She' s starving.
The lady hates chicken salad.
Gave it to her once, she threw up.
- August 1 7, conference call.
- Shania' s there promoting her apparel, right?
She hates it.
And she cannot eat chicken salad.
That' s nojoke.
September 3, in traffic, your cell phone.
Shania' s there promoting her apparel, right?
Back then that' s all she' s eating, tuna fish.
No mayo.
I eat two of the sandwiches in front ofher.
Now she believes me.
She eats one and a half sandwiches before she realizes it' s chicken salad.
Why do you think that you tell the mayo story so much?
- I don' t know.
- [Bernard]
It' s propaganda.
- Dor mayonnaise?
- Dor you.
Specifically, you' re so impressive because you know Shania.
And you' re so strong, because you pull one on her.
- You' re a funny guy, a good guy.
- Keeping everyone laughing... so that maybe, quote, you don' t get depressed.
Well, what' s so great about depression?
Nothing.
Unless it holds the key... to something you compulsively avoid... so it will never be examined or felt... hence your behavior becomes repetitive like the story.
- Like the story.
- Like the story.
- Like the story.
Like the story.
- Like the story.
Shut up.
All right.
I don' t have to tell stories.
What do you think would happen if you didn' t tell the stories?
- Are you being yourself?.
- How am I not myself?
- Myself.
- Myself.
- "How am I not myself?"
"How am I not myself?."
- "How am I not myself?."
How am I not myself?
How am I not myself?
How am I not myself?. How am I not myself?.
How am I not myself?.
How am I not myself?.
How am I not myself?.
- [Woman]
Bradley?
She' s starving.
She' s a busy lady.
I order a ton of tuna fish sandwiches.
That' s all she was eating back then, tuna fish.
- No mayo -- - Hey, Bradley, how do you like the corporate men' s room?
Freakin' awesome, man.
Hey, Brad, you want to hear something funny?
The Dundalee Cups are blowin' out in the Sunbelt franchises.
How' s that for super weird?
That' s a good thing to bring to the table today.
Right?
You arejust what the doctor ordered, my friend.
- Right?
- Right on.
Well, let' s go, dude.
I' m gonna introduce you to the board of directors, my friend.
- John, what did Legal say?
- Jerry?
- We have a legal problem.
- Well, I disagree.
Give him the Salmon Stripper, call it the Bass Basher.
They don' t read English anyway.
Legal can cover that.
Speaking of Shania and tuna, Brad has the most incredible story.
- Go ahead, Brad.
- There' s a Bass Basher in Japan?
What' s that about?
- Well, we' ve got a trademark issue in Japan.
- You got a legal problem?
L- Let' s hear the Shania story.
I mean, that' s what they wanna hear.
- Yeah, come on, tell the Shania story.
- Come on, Brad.
I don' t want to tell that story.
- What?
- I don' t want to tell that story, Marty.
Come on.
You and Shania are downtown in the loop in Chicago.
You' re opening up the store.
Shania, she all of a sudden, she gets --
- She gets -- - Hungry.
Right.
And so, you order -- - Tuna sandwiches.
- Yeah, tuna fish.
I thought she was a vegetarian.
You order tuna fish, okay, but you realize that she' s allergic to --
- Marty, no.
- She' s allergic -- Yes.
Come on.
She' s allergic to what?
Why don' t you and me go outside and have a -- have a talk?
Come on.
- I' il be back in five.
Five minutes?
Is he gonna put a bonnet on?
- Be right back.
What the fuck was that?
Duck!
- You' re gonna get on the truck like everybody else.
- Get on the bike.
Truck!
- Bike.
Engine Company 54, stand by.
- I' m free as a bird!
You' re just sittin 'in your gas guzzlers.
- [Horn Honking]
Where are you guys?
I' m at the fire, man.
Here we are.
Pull it down.
Creation, destruction.
Creation, destruction.
Creation, destruction.
Oh, no.!
[Crying]
My life.
Why?
Oh, Brad, look at yourself.
- My life.
- You' re sitting in a big pile of shit.
- Brad, it' s okay.
Believe me.
Nothing' s okay.
Nothing' s okay, so it' s okay.
You think it' s bad, right...
I gotta go -- I gotta go to a benefit.
Don' t -- Don' t tell anybody.
No, tell everybody.
I don' t care.
Tell everybody!
- [Bernard]
Wait a second.
Oh, no, please, don' t tell anybody.
You didn' t see me cry.
Nobody sees that picture!
- Nobody sees that picture!
Why did you do that?
- No, no, no, no.
We didn' t do this.
We would never do something like this.
- [Vivian]
We didn' t do this.
- Never.
Who the hell is that lady with the camera?
- See- See -- See, this isn' t our thing.
- That is her thing.
- [Brad Crying]
Why did you do that to me?
All right.
I' m gonna go to the benefit.
Screw all you bastards.
- Brad.!
- Brad.!
- Brad, we didn' t do this.
- She did it, Brad.
- Yes, I did.
That fire was a bitch- ass thing to do.
No, it liberated you from the Brad.
Or did it bond me to Brad in the insanity of pain... until I saw that I' m Brad and he' s me?
- [Vivian]
- No.
Come on.
You guys work together, don' t you?
- We don' t work together at all.
It' s not like some secret deal... where she picks up where you leave off, and then we come back to you?
- There is no secret deal.
- Well, there should be, 'cause that' s the way it works.
You' re too dark, and you' re not dark enough.
You three were close, right?
Maybe too close.
Then it went sour and propelled you into one extreme... and you into another extreme.
So, voila!
Two overlapping, fractured philosophies... were born out of that one pain.
Albert!
What happened to him?
I don' t know.
Welcome to the Omni Hotel.
Uh, we don' t -- We don' t check bikes, sir.
- Yeah, treat it like it' s a car.
- It -- It' s not a car.
It' s my job.
Tenth floor.
Welcome to the Huckabees Open Spaces gala event.
Huckabees pledges to -- [Continues, Indistinct]
Davy, come on.
- Mr. Stand, you' re not on the list.
Let' s talk to Marty.
- What are you calling me Mr. Stand for?
Marty, I' m me.
I made it.
- Marty, will you let Brad in?
Keep him out.
- Has everybody lost their minds?
Come on.
- I put this together.
I put this together!
- I know it' s tough.
Josh, I put this together.
Shania.
Shania.!
- It' s the new Miss Huckabees.
- Sorry.
I thought you were Shania.
Can I get your autograph, please?
These are still the old pictures.
This is a collector' s item for sure.
Thank you so much.
- What' s this, Dawn?
- Do you love me?
- I think so.
- With the bonnet?
It' s over, Brad.
I had a fire and almost died, and he came.
And he almost died 'cause he cares about the same things.
- It' s okay.
And he likes the bonnet.
Excuse me.
We have a V. I. P. function here.
I need to ask you guys to leave, please.
The gentleman behind the bush, you have to leave, please.
One world.
One store.
Huckabees, the everything store.
Shopping, nature, together.
- Did they let you in to the benefit?
- I didn' t even try to get in.
Brad, I thought about chopping your head off with a machete many times.
I thought about hacking you up with an ax, Albert... and smashing your face in with a baseball bat.
Eighteenth floor.
- [Albert]
We' re going down.
- Uh, no, I think you' re going up.
- Right you are.
Come on in.
Ma' am.
- MaryJane.!
- Oh, at last.
- How could you?
- How could you do that to us, you liar?
- This is a win for us.
Come on.
A Dexicorp mall in my grandfather' s forest is not exactly a win.
And they' ve already started surveying to -- to start construction.
- [Albert]
By giving them the woods.
Are we going up or what?
All you did was make Huckabees look good.
That' s all you did.
Albert, how can you be calm?
Did you hear what Brad did?
- I' m dealing with it.
You' il see this is a win for us.
- Shania doesn' t give a shit!
- Oh, Shania cares.
- Let' s go!
- Shania doesn' t give a shit!
- We saved the marsh -- - Duck him!
- So you sold out the woods?
- This new mall is going to be very eco- friendly.
I saved half the trees.
Did I sell out the woods?
I don' t know.
I tried to do some good.
You know, I saved half of' em.
- Brad, I torched yourJet Skis.
- And my house?
- No, just yourJet Skis.
It spread to the house.
I' m sorry.
Thirty- sixth floor.
- You guys going down?
Good.
Who is that?
You or me?
Give me --
Give me that!
Hit the alarm.
- You' re only smashing yourself, Brad!
- Yeah.
And now I' m smashing myself!.
Now I' m smashing myself!.
- [Recording]
Twenty- first floor.
Shania.
Brad, do you realize when they destroy the woods --
- No, let me explain. - the average temperature of the marsh rises five degrees?
- The entire food chain is degraded, starting with frogs.
- Let me explain.
Let me explain.
Okay, but we saved half the woods.
I' m a vegetarian, Brad.
I eat tofu tuna.
With the mayo, and you liked it.!
Shania, I' m Albert.
I used to run the Open Spaces Coalition.
See?
- So what if she knew your name?
Come on.
Yeah, okay, I' m caught up in that shit.
- [Recording]
Eighteenth floor.
Albert, we owe you an apology.
We should' ve stayed with you.
Thanks, Angela.
See you at the meeting on Tuesday.
We' re gonna stop those bulldozers.
- Oh, my goodness.
I don' t have a job.
I don' t even know who I am.
That' s exactly how I felt.
Try this lady.
Ah, here he comes!
- The man- poet who banged France' s dark lady of philosophy.
The parking lot crusader of truth... who turned his back on his other like a cold- blooded gangsta.
I know.
- You hurt my feelings.
- I' m sorry.
- But you had to do it anyway, didn' t ya?
- She' s a very powerful person.
- And I haven' t been with a lot of women.
- Obviously.
And she used me to teach us about the inevitability of human drama.
So?
Is that where you get off the ride?
Hell no.
I didn' t think so.
- Looks like you saw some truth.
- Looks like you saw some truth.
- What' d you see?
- Well, the interconnection thing is definitely for real.
- It is!
I didn' t think it was.
- I can' t believe it.
It' s so fantastic!
- That' s amazing.
- I know.
But it' s also nothing special.
Yeah, because it grows from the manure of human trouble.
You see, the detectives, they just wanted to gloss right over that.
But in fact, no manure, no magic.
- Did you hear some of that?
- Some of it sounds pretty good.
I think --
I think this case is closed.
Is it ever really closed?
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- I was thinking about chaining myself to a bulldozer.
- Do you want to come?
- What time?
Mm, 1: 00, 1: 30.
Sounds good.
Should I bring my own chains?
We always do.
The. Ladykillers. DVDRiP. XViD- DEiTY

The age of Montel!
Sweet lord of mercy,

Do you need somethin 'to eat, angel?
Othar, I went and complained about Weemack today,
Don' t know if it' il do any good,
Fiery pit!
"Left My Wallet in El Segundo,"
Ooh!
67 years of life, 46 years of marriage,
You mean to tell me you never once suffered from piles?
Well, it' s the human condition,
Most humans, anyhow,
Like that ballplayer said, "The world' s got two kind of folks,"
"Them that' s got the piles and them that' s goin 'get' em,"
But you always was healthy as a ox,
Passed on 'fore you could get the piles,
Ooh, thank the Lord you never was sick,
I just want to pass away nice and peaceful,
Go to sleep one night, wake up in the glory land!
Whoo!
Pickles!
- Go fetch Pickles!
- Pickles?
Oh, he' s up that tree again!
You' d better shimmy on up,
Well, I do apologize, madam, but, won' t the feline eventually tire of his lonely perch and, pining for his master' s affection, return on his own initiative?
Uh, the point being, must we actually ascend the tree?
Look, I don' t want no doubletalk,
Now, if you not gon 'fetch him, I guess I gotta call the police,
- Police?
- And they not goin 'be happy,
Every time they have to fetch him, they swear they' il never do it no more,
No need to call the authorities, madam,
I did this often as a child,
I was a positive lemur, Here, kitty!
- Oh, don' t upset him now!
- I wouldn' t think of it, madam,
Harmless little Felix domesticus,
Here, Kitty, Come to G, H,
Come, come, Here, kitty, Here, kitty,
Come, come, come, No, no, no,
That' s not how Sheriff Wyner do it,
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Come, come, come,
Come to the professor,
Yes, Y, Ah!
Uh, thank you, madam, for your act of kindness,
- Well, you let him out, - I certainly did, and for that I apologize no end,
Allow me to present myself, um, formally,
Goldthwait Higginson Dorr, Ph, D,
Like Elmer?
- I beg your pardon, ma' am?
- Fudd,
No, no, Ph, D, is a mark of academic attainment bestowed, in my case, in recognition of my mastery of the antique languages of Latin and Greek,
I also hold a number of other advanced degrees, including the baccalaureate from a school in Paris, France, called the Sorbonne,
Sore bone, Well, that fits,
You ever study at Bob Jones University?
I have not had that privilege,
Oh, that' s a Bible school, Only the finest in the country,
- I send 'em $5 every month, - That is very generous,
- I' m on the mailin 'list!
I' m a Angel, - Are you?
Yes,
Oh, they list my name in the newsletter every issue,
- Do they?
- Oh, I got the literature right over here,
- if you' d like to examine it, - Perhaps when my head has recovered from its, uh, uh, buffeting,
Mrs, Munson, are you at all curious as to why I darkened your door, as the expression would have it, on this lovely, lovely camellia- scented morn?
Well, I was wonderin 'till you let Pickles out,
- I quite understand, - Then in all the excitement,
The fact is, I saw the sign in your window advertising a room to let?
And there are no other such signs among the houses
- on this charming, charming street, - Yeah, I got a room, $15 a week, I' m lookin 'for a quiet tenant,
Madam, you are addressing a man who is quiet and yet not quiet, If I may offer a riddle,
I am currently on sabbatical from the institution where I teach, the University of Mississippi at Hattiesburg,
I am takin 'a year off to indulge my passion, and I do not believe that is too strong a word, for the music of the Renaissance,
I perform in, and have the honor of directing, a period- instrument ensemble that performs at Renaissance Fairs and other cultural for a throughout central and southern Mississippi,
We perform on the instruments for which the music was originally composed,
Now, wait a minute, You got some kind of band?
Oh, no, The word "band" would be, in this context, something of a misnomer,
Though we do play together, hence the word "ensemble", the nature of the music is such that, well, one would hesitate to apply the epithet "band"
- with connotations of janglin 'rhythms, - So y' all ain' t playin' no hippity- hop?
"I Left My Wallet in El Segundo", Songs with the titles spelled all funny?
Oh, no, no, We play music that has been composed to the greater glory of God,
Devotional music, Church music,
Gospel music?
Well, inspired by the gospel, certainly,
The vintage, of course, is no more recent than the Rococo,
Rococo, huh?
Well, I guess that' d be OK,
But I don' t propose to inflict our rehearsals on you,
May I inquire, do you have a root cellar?
Yes, yes,
This looks promising,
A little dank, ain' t it?
Indeed, That only improves the acoustics,
Marvelous,
Yes, Ah!
Oh, these earthen walls are ideal for baffling the higher registers of the, uh, lute or sackbut,
That is why so much music of the cinquecento was played in crypts and catacombs, This is ideal, This is perfect, This is more than perfect,
- I can scarcely contain my glee, - Oh, you containin 'it OK,
You gotta peel this shit out, man, Sometimes it stick to the bottom,
Hey, this shit smells like piles,
You wouldn' t even believe this, man, Even out here on the casino floor you gonna find goddamn mercy pads, Tucks,
I don' t know what the fuck people be doin 'here while they gamblin',
Man, I ain' t peelin 'no funky shit with my human hands,
That ain' t nothin 'but a prescription for diseases and viruses
'cause Mr, Gudge checks everything,
This tunnel leads back onto the land for all the people that work for Mannex,
Mannex Corporation, They own the Bandit Queen, three other boats,
Now, this is where they think on their corporate shit, Gudge and them,
I mean, the light' s as ugly as all hell, but, shit, ain' t as many Tucks,
- Let me in, motherfucker!
- What' s the password?
Kiss my ass!
Now, this is where they count the dough, Now, if you try to take any of it,
Elron over there' il shoot yo 'ass, Goddamn!
Dawg, this is a motherfuckin 'pigsty, man!
You are a squeakyass, motherfuckin 'pig!
Man, look at your ass, You got Cocoa Krispies on your uniform,
Got breakfast there, and you still eatin 'goddamn lunch, man,
I swear to God, if that ass was nickels, you' d be a motherfuckin 'millionaire,
Spread out, boy, Look at you, You a disgraceful fucka!
You is a fat motherfucker, man!
I swear,
Hey, Mr, Gudge, uh,
- How you doin 'this mornin'?
- I' m doin 'fine,
- All right, - So, how' s the new man?
Oh, shit, he a cleanin 'motherfucker, man,
- Is that a fact?
- What' s up, my nigga?
Cut!
Cut, cut, cut!
Goddamn it, his canteen fell off, Props!
- The goddamn thing' s canteen fell off, - OK, We' re prepared for that,
Mountain, put Otto into the apparatus,
- What the hell is this?
- World War I vintage gas mask,
It' s authentic, Strapped on, of course, so it can' t fall off,
Now, the animal is free to be as active as he wants,
It doesn' t inhibit his movement in any way, and,, I think it really sells the whole doughboy thing,
- It looks like a fucking joke, - Uh, you' re absolutely right,
The gas mask is a whimsical concept,
How the hell does it eat when it gets to the Nibbles Ready- to- Eat?
- Well, you' re absolutely right, - Don' t let the clients see this,

Oh, no, he can breathe, Eh, eh, that thing is,

I know you all remember that when Moses came down the mountain carrying the Word of God, come down that Sinai peak,
- he caught them Israelites red- handed, - Yes!
What' d he catch 'em doin'?
He caught 'em worshippin'
- a golden calf, - Yes!
He caught 'em worshippin' a false god,
He caught them Israelites in decline,
In decline!
What did Moses do when he saw those, declinin ', backslidin', never- mindin 'sinners?
What did he do?
Mosses smote those sinners in his wrath!
Yes, he did!
Y' all know what "smote" is?
I smite, you smite, he smites, we done smote!
To smite is to go upside the head!
Because sometimes, brothers and sisters, that' s the only way!
The only way,
To smite is to remind we got to stop that decline and scramble back up to the face of the Almighty God!
- Amen!
- Instead of worshippin 'that golden calf, that earthly trash on that garbage island,
That garbage island in the shadowland, wa- a- ay,
way outside the Kingdom of God!
That garbage island, where scavenger birds feast on the bones of the backslidin 'damned!
And so, let us pray,
My dear lady, I do so hope this is not an inopportune time for our first practice,
Somebody die?
I beg your pardon?
Oh!
No, no, no, No, I' m not bereaved,
And, of course, our instruments contrived in an age ignorant of miniaturization,
Allow me to introduce my friends, my colleagues, these devoted and passionate musicians,
Ain' t no smokin 'in this house,
Oh, Sorry,
What do you think, General?
Present any problems?
Good then, Gentlemen, why don' t we crowd around and go over the plan?
Gentlemen, this is the Bandit Queen, Gambling den, Cash cow,
Sodom of the Mississippi Delta and the focus of our little exercise,
Here is Orchard Street,
Here is the residence of Marva Munson, the charming lady whom you all met moments ago,
Gentlemen, I' m sure you' re all aware that the Solons of the state of Mississippi, to wit, its legislature, have decreed that no gaming establishment shall be erected within its borders upon dry land,
They may, however, legally float,
While the gambling activity is restricted to these riverboats, no such restrictions apply to the functions ancillary to this cash- besotted business,
The casino' s offices, locker rooms, facilities to cook and clean, and, most importantly, its counting houses, the reinforced, secret, super- secure repositories of the lucre, may all be situated, wherever,
- Gawain, where is "wherever"?
- Say what?
- Where' s the money?
- Oh,
OK, look, At the end of every shift, pit boss brings the cash down to the hold of the ship in a locked cashbox, and once a day all the cash is moved down to the countin 'room,
And where is the counting room?
Uh, it be right there in that square where you pointin ',
And what, to flog a horse that if not dead is at this point in mortal danger of expiring, does this little square represent?
Offices, Underground,
Ha!
Underground!
Underground,
During the casino' s hours of operation, the door to this counting room is fiercely guarded,
The door itself is of redoubtable Pittsburgh steel,
When the casino closes this entire underground complex is locked up, and the armed guard retreats to the casino' s main entrance,
There, then, far from the guard, reposes the money, behind a five- inch- thick steel portal, yes, But the walls, the walls are but humble masonry behind which is only the soft, loamy soil deposited over centuries by the Old Man, the meanderin 'Mississippi, as it fanned its way back and forth across the great alluvial plain, leaving earth,
This earth,
The General here, whose curriculum vitae comprehends massive tunnelin 'experience through the soil of his native French Indochina, shall be directin' our little old tunnelin 'operation,
Garth Pancake, though a master of none, is a jack of all those trades corollary to our aim,
He will be doin 'such fabricatin' and demolition work
- as our little caper shall require, - Happy to be on board,
Gawain is our proverbial "inside man,"
He has managed to secure himself a berth on the custodial staff of the Bandit Queen,
- Damn skippy!
- And this brings us to Lump,
To look at Lump, you might wonder what specialized expertise could he possibly offer our merry little old band of miscreants,
Well, gentlemen, in a project of such risks, it is imperative to enlist the services of a hooligan, a goon, an ape, a physical brute,
And, on our behalf, I wish him a warm Mississippi welcome,
- Fuckin 'A, - Whassup, my nigga?
Well, gentlemen, here you are,
Men with, in fact, but two things in common:
One, you all saw fit to answer my advertisement in the Memphis Scimitar, and two, you' re all going to be, in consequence, very, very, incredibly, rich,
Let us revel in our adventure, gentlemen,
Let us make beautiful music together, and, by all means, let us keep this to ourselves,
What we say in this root cellar, let it stay in this root cellar,
There' s no "l" in "team",
Trouble in and trouble out
Trouble' s wwhat this wworld' s about
Troubles of this world the Devil' s in this world
Trouble in, trouble out
Trouble' s wwhat this wworld' s about
Troubles of this world the Devil' s in this world
You up the river without a paddle in a lot of trouble
Without a doubt you going under running out of bubbles
Pass me the body bag watch me dump 'em
It ain' t nothing for you to get squashed like a pumpkin
I try so hard and play my cards afraid to fall, I ain' t involved
I gotta call I' m much appalled
I came to O Z and broke the laws
Bring on the casket ain' t too glad
'Cause dirty hazard wrapped in plastic
It' s OK, Don' t stop on account of me,
No, No, no, no, no, Not at all, madam,
Not at all, We were about to take a break anyway,
The glissandi on this particular piece are technically very, very demanding, and I' m sure we would all welcome a moment of R and R,
Well, I just thought maybe you' d like to see,
What have you gotten into, honey?
Why you sweating like that?
Uh, Uh,
Uh, eh, 'cause,' cause, That boy right there?
He plays one bitch barrel full of a sackbut!
- Ain' t that right, Lump?
- Uh- huh,
I' m tellin 'you, he can tear it up, Right, Lump?
Ain' t nobody play the sackbut like Lump right there, He,
Hoo- hoo- hoo!
Don' t be shy, Lump, Don' t be shy, Lump, that boy, he go, at it like it was some pussy!
- Oh, shit!
- Mind your mouth!
This is a Christian house, boy, No hippity- hop language in here,
- Sometime it' s the only way, - Now listen, you ain' t gonna hit me,
I' m tryin 'to help you, boy, better yourself!
And so you should, madam, So you should,
Gawain is so far transported by his love of the music of the early Renaissance,
Don' t make me no never- mind, he transported!
- I understand, - You been smokin '?
And I was offering an explanation, not an excuse,
- I myself am, - Hey, hey, hey,, don' t be explainin 'me, dawg!
You can' t read my motherfuckin 'mind, man!
You might got yo 'Ph, D, but I got my GED!
- Yes, - Nigga!
A fiery lad, but then youth is fiery,
A fact often remarked upon by the poets of the Romantic era,
My youth, I was in church, I wasn' t walkin 'around fiery,
Youth ain' t no excuse for nothin ',
Anyhow, I just came to show you the fife, Othar' s fife, Burned his own,
I thought maybe, you bein 'a man of music, you' d be interested,
Oh, indeed I am,
Cut it himself and burned his holes,
The Israelites called it a khalil,
Yeah, you can read all about it in the Bible, Ain' t nothin 'new under the sun,
Indeed not,
Gone these 20 years,
He was some kind of man,
Blowed the khalil,
I don' t suppose Othar ever turned his hand or, or turned his lip to blowing the shofar?
The ceremonial ram' s horn sounded by the priests of the Hebrews,
No, I don' t know nothin 'about that, Othar never blowed no shofar!
- Of course not, - Not to the extent of my knowledge,
The khalil was good enough for my Othar,
He was some kind of man,
Some kind of man,
Oh, goddamn!
Come on, girl, let me get one little peek,
Don' t be cruel, Come on, just one butt cheek,
Pull that ass out and make it clap,
Aw, just 'cause I' m dressed like a janitor, don' t mean you gotta do me dirty,
This muthafucka' s hit the jackpot, Come on, girl,
Come over here and blow on these dice,
You know, I' m a seven on the roll now, but I' m a 10 the hard way, and I ain' t just talkin 'crap,
Mr, Gudge, she had a ass that could pull a bus,
I mean, Gudge, it was more than an ass, it was literature,
Yeah, I don' t care how big her ass was, MacSam, You' re fired,
You say what?
There is no fraternizing with customers on the Bandit Queen,
- Clean out your locker, - But, Mr, Gudge, I wasn' t fraterniz,
I said get outta here, You' re fired,
You can' t fire me!
I' il sue your ass!
For what?
For fuckin 'punitive damages, man!
- Punitive damages, - Yeah,
Punitive damages, You goddamn skippy!
- Punitive damages, - I see why you firin 'me, Mr, Gudge,
Yeah, it' s simple and plain, You firin 'me' cause I' m black,
MacSam, everybody on the custodial staff is black,
Your replacement is gonna be black,
His replacement, no doubt, will be black!
Well, the fuckin 'judge is goin' be black, muthafucka,
- Oh, - And you?
- You gon 'stand tall before the man, - Oh,
And your replacement' s gonna be black,
- muthafucka!
- Thank you,
Oh, my,
Oh, my, my, my, my, my, my, my,
This is a severe setback,
I am distraught, I' m more than distraught,
I am devastated,
I- I' m beside myself, I' m at a positive loss for words,
- You still talkin 'OK, though, - Have you all decided?
Madam, we must have waffles, We must all have waffles forthwith,
We must all think, We must all have waffles and think, each and every one of us, to the very best of his ability,
Perhaps if you apologized to the man and gave him flowers,
Or perhaps a fruit basket with a card depicting a misty seascape and inscribed with a sentiment,
I ain' t apologizin 'to that muthafucka, He fired me' cause I' m black!
He can' t do that, You could sue him, Open and shut case,
- Fuckin 'A, - Surely a chocolate assortment has been known to melt the heart of even the hardest misanthrope,
That man ain' t rollin 'over for no fucking candy bar,
Uh, we' ve had a bit of a setback on the tunneling front, too,
- We' ve run into a pretty large rock, - Rock!
- Very bad, Very bad, - Oh, my,
Seems that the poet was right,
Troubles never singly come,
Oh, no, we can get through the rock, No worries there,
Easiest thing in the world, Why, we just blow right through it,
I got a pyro license, Just, uh, bore a hole in the rock and pack in a little plastique, Igneous blows pretty good,
- And then we could, - Hello, Garth,
- Am I ordering the primer cord?
- Yes, Mountain,
We were just talking about that, and some plastique,
- What the fuck is this?
- Oh, this is Mountain Girl,
Mountain is my right hand, She helps me out with ordnance,
- Helps me with, damn near everything, - Hey,
You brought yo 'bitch to the Waffle Hut?
I must confess myself to be puzzled as well,
I thought it was understood that when it came to our little enterprise,
"mum" was the word,
Of course, I understand that, but this is Mountain Girl,
I don' t keep secrets from Mountain,
That' s not how you maintain a loving, caring relationship,
You brought yo 'bitch to the Waffle Hut!
The man brought his bitch, to the Waffle Hut!
All right, look, you, I will thank you to stop referring to Mountain that way,
She is the other half of my life,
Everybody lookin 'at me like I' m some kind of fuck- up for losin' a sorry- ass job, and this muthafucka brings his bitch
- to the muthafuckin 'Waffle Hut!
- Son- of- a- bitch punk!
- Shut your goddamn mouth!
- You better raise the fuck up, fucka!
- Gentlemen, please, - Back the fuck up!
You gon 'back that shit the fuck up!
- Gentlemen, please, - What?!
What?!
Please, gentlemen, this behavior does you no credit in the eyes of your colleagues, nor in those of the other patrons of this Waffle Hut,
Little punk,
Oh, look at this, I got blueberry syrup on my safari jacket!
Gentlemen, I propose that we consider the matter of this woman,
- Mountain Water, - Mountain Girl,
And we shall choose to trust her since we have no choice, and since she shall share only in Mr, Pancake 's portion of the booty,
Of course, Wouldn' t have it any other way,
- Yeah, you damn right you won' t, - Up yours, punk,
- Oh, fuck you and the Swiss Miss, - The matter of disposing
- of our igneous impediment is also, - C- Coach, Coach,
- C- C- Coach, I, -, closed, Settled,
That leaves us only with the question of Gawain retrieving his job,
- Coach, I, - Yes, Lump?
Couldn' t we just bribe the guy?
You are a readin 'fool, aren' t you, Mr, Dorr?
Yes, I must confess,
I often find myself more at home in these ancient volumes than I do in the hustle- bustle of the modern world,
To me, paradoxically, the literature of the so- called "dead tongues" holds more currency than this morning' s newspaper,
In these books, in these volumes, there is the accumulated wisdom of mankind, which succors me when the day is hard and the night lonely and long,
The wisdom of mankind, huh?
- What about the wisdom of the Lord?
- Oh,
Yes, yes, The Good Book, mm, I have found reward in its pages,
But, to me, there are other good books as well,
Heavy volumes of antiquity freighted with the insights of man' s glorious age,
And then, of course, I just love, love, love the works of Mr, Edgar Allan Poe,
Oh, I know who he was, Kinda spooky,
No, madam, no, no,
Not of this world, it' s true,
He, he lived in a dream, An ancient dream,
"Helen,
Thy beauty is to me
Like those Nicean barks of yore,
That gently, o' er a perfumed sea,
The weary, wayward wanderer bore
To his own native shore, "
Who was Helen?
- Some kinda whore of Babylon?
- One doesn' t know who Helen was, but I picture her as being very, very, extremely, pale,
Mrs, Munson, I have been trying to figure out some way of expressin 'my gratitude to you for takin' in this weary, wayward wanderer,
It' s just a little old present, Why, it' s hardly anything at all,
Oh, why, Mr, Dorr!
You are a gallant man,
Oh, madam, I blush, I melt, No,
I just happened to hear of this gospel concert tomorrow night,
"The Mighty, Mighty Clouds of Joy", and I thought you and a friend from church perhaps would,?
- Yes, I have a widow lady friend, - The concert is up in Memphis, so I have arranged a car service to transport you thither,
Ah?
Why, Sheriff Wyner!
How you doin '?
Good evenin ', Mrs, Munson,
I just stopped by here to let you know I did have a talk with Weemack, and he told me he' s gonna comply with your request in keepin 'that music down and neighborly,
So you just go and have yourself a pleasant evenin ',
Wait a minute, I got somebody that I want you to meet,
Uh, ma' am, you know what?
I' m, I' m a little pressed for time,
You got a gang of bank robbers youse chasin '?
Come on in here and say hello,
Yeah, we was in here, havin 'tea and,
Huh!
Bussed his own dishes, You can always tell a gentleman,
- Somebody was in here, ma' am?
- Yeah, with me and Othar,
Well, you know what?
Maybe I' il catch him the next time,
Oh, come on up to his room with me and say hello,
I got a family, My wife got dinner on the table,
I really have to be goin ',
- Oh, my, He is neat!
- Yes, ma' am, he very neat,
He probably went down to the cellar to play with his friends,
Ma' am, I really got to be goin 'now,
- What,?
- Ma' am, I really need to be gettin 'back,
Mrs, Munson, don' t, You don' t have to,
Mrs, Munson?
Why, Professor!
What in the world are you doin 'havin' tea down there?
Uh, Mrs, Munson?
Oh, Lord Jesus,
- Mrs, Munson?
- Land of Goshen, child!
- Come on out from under there!
- Mrs, Munson, my pager just went off,
I got to go, I' il meet you and your friend later,
That was refreshing,
Y' all have a good evenin 'now!
As you know, we academics are inordinately fond of wedgin 'ourselves into confined spaces,
At Yale, the students will see how many of their number they can enclose in a telephone booth, At Harvard, a broom closet,
Oh!
Hope I didn' t spill my tea,
Well, what the hell is this?
I guess it' s just my way of sayin ', um,
Oh, well, goddamn it, Mr, Gudge, Look here, I,
I don' t know what it' s like walkin 'in your shoes,
You know, with you bein 'a tight- ass and all,
And I' m pretty sure you don' t know what it' s like walkin 'in my shoes,
See, Mr, Gudge, there' s the custodian, right?
And then there' s the man inside the custodian,
And that' s the motherfucker we got a problem with,
See, 'cause that man, he got needs, Mr, Gudge, and normally those needs gotta do with women with big asses,
I guess my point bein 'is I realize I' m a bunkie junkie,
But if you woulda seen the kettle drums on this girl, Mr, Gudge, whew!
Well, we all human,
This apology buys you a one- week probationary period,
Thank you, Mr, Gudge,
Stay away from the customers, MacSam,
This drill bit' s getting awfully hot,
Gawain, maybe you could fill a Hudson sprayer and spritz it down while I drill,
Fuck you, I ain' t your motherfuckin 'house nigger, I' m the inside man,
All right, look, are you gonna have a bug up your ass for the rest of the time we work together?
- I' il get the sprayer, - Oh, no, no, No,
Me and this gentleman here have to get square,
Let me tell you somethin ', MacSam,
I' m gonna tell you about how I came down to Mississippi,
I wasn' t born here, you know, I' m from Scranton, Pennsylvania,
What the fuck?
Scranton, Pennsylvania, Came down here in 1964, Greyhound bus,
With the Freedom Riders,
Do you know who the Freedom Riders were, MacSam?
No, and I don' t give a fuck,
Just tell me when the fuck they gonna leave, Damn!
The Freedom Riders, my fine young man, were a group of concerned liberals from up north, all working together, just like we are here,
Involved citizens who came down here so that local black folk could have their civil liberties,
So that people like you could have the vote,
- You know what, man?
- What, brother?
- I don' t vote, So fuck you, - You little fuckin 'ingrate,
- And the bus you rode in on, jackass!
- Let' s step outside, MacSam!
Fuck the outside!
Come on!
What?!
My friend Mrs, Funthes is here, so I' m about to go out,
Just thought I' d leave y' all with some cinnamon cookies,
Why, that is lovely,
Ooh, y' all sound good!
(chuckles) Maybe you could come by the church one Sunday,
- give us a recital, - Why, how kind of you!
Our music, however, is, uh, well, how shall I put this?
Uh, a bit Roman in its outlook,
Uh, many of our pieces were commissioned by the Holy See,
Oh, I see, all right, but we don' t make no big whoop- dee- do about denomination,
Everybody welcome at our church, Yeah, we had a Methodist come in,
Episcopalian, Back in the '60s, we had a Jew come in!
- He had a guitar, - (chucking) A Jew with a guitar,
If you will excuse me one moment, madam, I shall, uh, I shall see you out,
If you gentlemen can labor harmoniously in the course of my absence, perhaps upon my return we shall be prepared to explode that vexin 'old piece of igneous,
Oh, Professor!
This is Mrs, Funthes,
Enchanté, Mrs, Funthes, Allow me,
Rosalie, this is Professor G, H, Dorr, Ph, D,
Oh, my, That' s an awful lot of letters,
Oh, well, no,
Of course, in my youth, I was known simply as Goldthwait,
Uh- huh,
All right, safety meeting,
Let' s listen up, General, can you hand me the primer cord?
Before we set the charge, we will run through our procedure,
I have earplugs for whoever wants them, Just wedge those right in your ears,
Now, here we have, Not yet, Lump,
- Oh, - Now, primer cord,
Gelatinite, C- 4,
A and B,
I remember my father sayin 'to me - and it' s one of the few memories I retain of the man from one of his visits home, and how I do cherish it - he said to me, "Goldthwait, you are not formed as other boys,"
He a man of learnin '?
This is the same procedure we will be using when we collapse the tunnel after entering the casino vault and returning to the root cellar,
He was a self- educated man, Didn' t have a career as such, but the government did recognize the breadth of his readin 'by makin' him librarian of the state nervous hospital in Meridian, where he was a distinguished inmate,
Once these materials are combined only the professionals may handle them,
That means me or the General,
Separately they are harmless, completely inert,
Why, you could light this stuff on fire, hit it with a ham, (explosion)
What in the name of heavens was that?
Well, um, I' m quite certain there' s absolutely no reason to be alarmed,
Why, I' m not even absolutely certain I heard anything at all,
Didn' t hear nothin '?!
Well, something perhaps,
Nothing that need discompose us was the sense I was tryin 'to convey,
Now, Mrs, Munson, I will not have you missin 'your musical recital, Off you go!
I shall call the gas company, or the water company,
Whatever subterranean utility is implicated in this contretemps,
I shall see to the matter, as only a highly educated classicist could,
Blood!
Blood, Professor, blood!
Blood, blood, blood!
(Pancake) It' s nothin 'to make a fuss about, It' s perfectly all right,
Jackass!
You better get yo 'ass back down there and find that shit, dipshit!
- Really, I' m perfectly all right, - Perfectly all right?
Jackass, you just blew your goddamn finger off!
The muthafucka down there flappin 'the fuck around!
You better get yo 'ass back down there and find it!
I' m tellin 'you right now, nubbie, I ain' t pickin' up your goddamn finger!
I gather there was a premature detonation,
Would you tell this muthafucka he can sew this shit back on?!
It' s like that dude whose wife cut his dick off, threw it on the freeway?
She just called Triple A, they towed the dick and sewed the muthafucka back on!
Listen up!
Jackass, I saw the muthafucka in a porno!
The thang still worked!
It looked like a chewed- up frank, but that little muthafucka be workin 'that muthafucka!
It' s mangly, but he be fuckin 'the bitch all kind of ways with a twisted dick!
Oh!
Your fuckin 'finger just moved!
The muthafucka movin 'slow now!
I' m not gettin 'that shit, Fuck that!
You' re on your own there!
They usin 'the house to practice music, of the Rococo,
I propose we get our fallen comrade to the hospital,
The General will follow when he manages to recover the severed digit,
No, no, really, I' m perfectly all right, I don' t know what all the fuss is about,
- Good news!
- Pickles!
Go get him!
The house is in apple- pie order, though we do have to get medical attention for Mr, Pancake, who, durin 'the disturbance, pinched his finger in the valve of his sackbut,
You let the cat out!
Wha,?
The General is even now exercisin 'every effort in retrievin' your mischievous little Pickles, Please, go on,
Go on and enjoy the concert!
Driver!
Au revoir, mesdames,
(Dorr) Despite our setback, we find ourselves on schedule to penetrate the vault here this afternoon, while Mrs, Munson is at church, havin 'blasted that little old rock to pieces durin' Mrs, Munson' s choir practice,
Garth, can you run us through the game plan for what remains of our tunnel?
Of course, Why, it' s child' s play now, Easiest thing in the world,
Only a couple of feet separate us from the vault,
Just the usual spadework until we get to the masonry of the vault, and then we just drill through,
And will you be able to wield the drill with your maimed extremity?
Oh, well, yeah, I should think so, Yeah, it' s, uh, it' s only one finger,
Inhibits me in doing finer work of course, I' il always have to live with that, (clears throat)
Maybe - I' m just thinkin 'out loud here - maybe, since as you say there will be problems later, maybe - and I actually mentioned this to Mountain Girl, she agrees with me, so it' s not just one person' s opinion - maybe, uh,
I should get a little extra compensation for the accident,
Somewhat larger share,
Why, if this was any other line of work, I' d be getting workman' s comp,
Wouldn' t I?
Might even have a pretty good lawsuit,
Wait, so you gonna sue yourself for blowing your own goddamn finger off?
- Well, now that is simply asinine, - Yes, but you see, Garth, this is not what you just called "some other line of work,"
Yeah, no, no, no, but if it were,
This is a criminal enterprise, not to put too fine a point on it, entailing any manner of risk not involved in honest labor,
Governmental regulations and civic safeguards cannot be assumed to apply to antisocial pursuits,
- Yeah, but he lost his finger, - We don' t give a fuck!
That fool could blow his goddamn dick off, it don' t make no nevermind to us!
We not payin 'this jackass for goin' around blowin 'off goddamn body parts!
Get yo 'fuckin' head out yo 'ass, man!
Look you, there is no call for,
No extra share!
OK, Majority rules,
Like I say, it was just a trial balloon, Hand' s not so bad really,
I even get some phantom feeling,
Yeah, you pull on your prick, you get some phantom feelin ',
- Fuck you, - Fuck you,
- Fuck you, nubbie!
Well, now that that matter is settled, why don' t we synchronize our watches before Gawain reports to work,
In 20 seconds, it will be exactly 12: 16,
- Fifteen, - What, it' il be 12: 15?
No, 15 seconds, Well, 11 seconds now, it’ il be 12: 16,
- Eight, seven, - Professor?
Prof,? -, six, - Professor?, five, Yes, Lump!
I don' t have a watch,
There' il be no more weepin 'and wailin'
No more weepin 'and wailin'
No more weepin 'and wailin'
Home to live with God Oh,
Soon I will be done with the troubles of this world
Troubles of this world Troubles of this world
Oh, soon I will be done with the troubles of this world
I' m goin 'home to live with God
Soon I will be done with the troubles of this world
Troubles of this world Troubles of this world
Troubles of this world
Soon I will be done with the troubles of this world
I' m goin 'home to live with God
Well, soon I will be done with the troubles of this world
Troubles of this world Troubles of this, great God!
Soon I will be done with the troubles of this world
I' m goin 'home to live with God
Well, I' m goin 'up to see King Jesus Hey, hey, yeah!
I' m gonna shake His loving hand
I' m gonna tell Him all about my trouble
As I' m travelin 'through this land!
Oh, soon I will be done
Troubles of this world
Yeah, soon I will be done
I' m goin 'home to live with God
Yeah, soon I will be done with the troubles of this world
Troubles of this world
Yeah, soon I will be done with the troubles, yeah
I' m goin 'home to live with God
Whoo- hoo- hoo!
Ain' t that somethin '!
- I, B, S, - You be what?
Irritable Bowel Syndrome!
Is there a men' s room down here?
Oh, come on, You shouldn' t be usin 'the men' s room now!
Or a lady' s room, (sniffs) Quickly, I, B, S,
If you knew you had the runs, why didn' t you shit back at the house?
Quickly!
We don' t want Elron finding your stinkin 'ass on the crapper!
No choice, It' s a medical condition, Quickly!
You one disgustin 'individual, you know that?
Come on, Follow me, (toilet flushes)
I feel 30 pounds lighter,
- Come the fuck on with your stinkass, - Thank you for being so understanding,
Not everyone is, of course, which is why the biggest challenge of I, B, S, is educating the public,
Afflicts over two million people, yet most of us have never heard of it,
And it strikes without regard to age, gender or race,
Oh, fuck, man, I don' t wanna hear about this shit,
Well, that' s exactly the kind of attitude we' re fighting,
I guess I never told you that' s how Mountain Girl and I met,
They had an I, B, S, weekend at Grossinger' s up in the Catskills,
Of course, the tourist business there has suffered with the demise of the Borscht Belt, so they have various promotions, mixers, so on,
This was a weekend for Irritable Bowel singles to meet and support each other
- and share stories, - Man, look here,
I don' t want to hear a single one of them stories, OK?
- Now, some of them are very moving, - Not one fucking story!
- Look, I didn' t choose to have I, B, S, - Man, shut the fuck up!
There' s no cure, you know, Only control, Lifelong condition,
Yeah, you know what?
Bein 'an asshole' s a lifelong condition, too,
Just drop the fuckin 'tools,
I' m not complaining, I did meet Mountain Girl,
Man, get back in the fuckin 'hole!
Oh!
(laughs) Marvel, Marvelous, Marv, This way!
This way, gentlemen!
Oh!
Excellent!
Excellent, Flawless, flawless, Thumbs up,
Can' t stop shittin ', Can' t stop talkin' about shittin ',
Gentlemen, to we few, We who have shared each other' s company, each other' s cares, each other' s joys, and who shall now reap the fruits of our communal efforts, shoulder to shoulder, from each according to his abilities, so forth and whatnot,
We have had our little differences along the way, but I' d like to think that they' ve only made us value one another all the more,
Each of us coming to understand and appreciate the other' s unique qualities and potencies and, yes, foibles,
I suggest that we shall look back upon this little caper one day, one distant day, grandchildren dandled upon our knee, and perhaps a tear will form and we shall say,
"Well, with wit and grit and no small amount of courage, we accomplished something on that day, a feat of derring- do, an enterprise not ignoble,"
We merry band, unbound by the constraints of society and the prejudices of the common ruck,
We happy few,
- Gentlemen, to us!
- (all) To us!
Charge shoulda gone off already,
I do beg your pardon?
The charge to collapse the tunnel, I set it for eight minutes,
Well, that much time and more has certainly elapsed,
I need not remind you, it is of the essence of this plan that the money should appear to have simply vanished without a trace,
- spirited away, as it were, by ghosts, - Of course,
The conundrum of the undisturbed, yet empty vault, the unsolvable riddle of the sealed yet violated sanctum, is of the utmost importance, not only to make our caper more intellectually satisfying, it is exigent as a matter of practical fact,
I remind you that if any tunnel is ever found leading to this house, the owner knows all your names,
("Trouble of This World")
You just fart?
Nope, nope, I' m fine, Perfectly all right!
Not a problem!
There' s no hole left,
Professor!
I' m surprised!
Well, uh, properly speaking, madam, we are surprised, You are taken aback,
Though I do acknowledge that the sense that you intend is gaining increasing currency through its use, yes,
You have returned from your devotions betimes,
I had to make tea,
I want to talk to you, Professor, so don' t you be leavin '!
And you!
I told you I don' t want any smokin 'in this house!
Oh, come on in!
How you doin '?
Tea, ladies,
Now, I don' t know what you boys been up to, but I know mischief when I see it, Now, I want an explanation, but first,
I want you to get your fannies up here with all y' all' s period instruments,
Now, I been tellin 'the ladies about your music, and they want to hear you play,
- Professor?
- Yes, Lump?
I can' t really play the buttsack,
Madam, or rather, mesdames, you must accept our apologies for not bein 'able to perform, for, as you see, we are shorthanded,
Gawain is still at work, and we could no more play with one part tacit than a horse could canter shy one leg,
Perhaps I could offer, as a poor but ready substitute, a brief poetic recital,
Though I do not pretend to any great oratorical skills, (laughs)
I would be happy to present, with your ladies' permission, verse from the unquiet mind of Mr, Edgar Allan Poe,
"Ladies, thy beauty is to me
Like those Nicean barks of yore,
That gently, o' er a perfumed sea, The weary, wayward wanderer bore
To his own native shore, "
- (ladies sigh) - My, my, my,
"On desperate seas long wont to roam,
Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,
Thy Naiad airs have brought me home
To the glory that was Greece And the grandeur that was Rome, "(tea lady # 1) Glory hallelujah, (all) Amen!
Hm?
(Dorr) Bye- bye, ladies, It was, it was my pleasure,
- (tea lady # 1) We have to do this again, - (tea lady # 2) Yes, we do got to,
Such a pleasure, Safe home, Safe home, (Mrs. Munson chuckles)
- Now I want to know what' s goin 'on, - Oh, indeed, indeed,
The thirst for knowledge is a very commendable thing,
Though I do believe that when you hear the explanation you shall laugh riotously, slappin 'your knee and perhaps even wipin' away a giddy tear, relieved of your former concern,
Lump here is an avid collector of Indian arrowheads, and having found one simply lying on your cellar floor -
- a particularly rare artifact of the Natchez tribe? -
Nats, what?
He enlisted the entire ensemble in an all- out effort to sift through the subsoil in search of others,
And apparently, in doing so, we hit a mother lode of natural gas,
I myself became acutely aware of the smell of "rotten eggs,"
And it was just at this inopportune moment that the General here violated the cardinal rule of this house
- and lit himself a cigarette, - So sorry,
Well, what about all that money?
Ah,
The money, Well, the money is Mr, Pancake' s,
- (clears throat) That' s right, - Who only just remortgaged his home in order to raise the money for a surgical procedure that will correct the wandering eye of his common- law wife, Mountain Water, who suffers from astigmia, strabismus and a general curdling of the vitreous jelly,
Mr, Pancake is an ardent foe of the Federal Reserve, and is, in fact, one of those eccentrics one often reads about hoardin 'his entire life savings, in Mr, Pancake' s case, in a Hefty bag that is his constant companion,
- The Steel Sak, - Don' t trust the banks, Never have,
It don' t smell right to me,
- I' m callin 'Sheriff Wyner, - No!
Madam!
Please, please, Madam!
No, no, I beg of, Yes!
Yes!
It is a lie!
It is a fantastic tale!
You have us dead to rights, but, madam, please, please, please allow me to tell you the truth in private,
Madam,
Madam, we are not musicians of the late Renaissance,
Nor of the early, nor mid period,
We are, in fact, criminals,
Desperate men, Mrs, Munson,
We have tunneled into the nearby offices of the Bandit Queen gambling emporium
- and relieved it of its treasure, - Lord have mercy,
It is true,
The Bandit Queen is a den of iniquity, a painted harlot luring people into sin by exciting the vice of greed with her promise of easy winnings, Oh, yes,
Her gains are ill- gotten,
But, I offer no excuses - save one,
We men have each pledged one half of our share of the booty to a charitable institution,
In compensation for the use of your home, we had planned to donate a full share to Bob Jones University, without burdening you with guilty knowledge by informing you of same,
But now you have wrested the information from me,
There you have it, It is on your table, Mrs, Munson,
The "awful truth,"
- Stolen money, - But find the victim, Mrs, Munson,
I challenge you, Even the casino itself, that riparian Gomorrah, shall suffer no harm,
It has an insurance company,
A financial behemoth that will cheerfully replenish its depleted vaults,
That is its function,
And that insurance company has tens and tens of thousands of policyholders,
So that, We have done the calculations, Mrs, Munson,
So that at the end of the day, at the final reckoning, each and every one of those policyholders shall have contributed one penny,
One, single, solitary cent to the satisfaction of this claim,
- One penny?
- One penny, Think of it, Mrs, Munson,
One penny from those thousands upon thousands of people so that Bob Jones University can continue on its mission,
Why, I have no doubt that, were those policy holders made aware of the existence of that august institution, each and every one of them would have volunteered some token amount for the furtherance of its aims,
Well, that' s prob' ly true,
Sadly, the criminal stain is upon my soul, but the benefit shall accrue to any number of worthy causes as long, that is, as the secret stays with us,
Well,
I can' t hardly see the harm in it,
- (mouthing) One penny,
- I' m sorry, - Excuse me?
No, I' m sorry, it' s wrong, and don' t you be leadin 'me into temptation,
- No, no, madam, I must strenuously, - I' m sorry, it' s just plain wrong,
- Stealin '!
- No, madam,
- I know your intentions was good, - No, they weren' t!
And I won' t call the police if you give back the money and y' all go to church with me next Sunday,
And engage in divine worship?!
I' ve made up my mind,
Now, you can doubletalk all you want, It' s church or the county jail,
Think it over, I gotta feed the cat,
- Motherfuck!
- Yes,
Unfortunately, Mrs, Munson has rather complicated the situation,
Yeah, well, I know how to decomplicate it,
You bust a cap in that old bitch' s head, everything be simple,
Not easy to do, Many reasons,
Practical ones:
Quiet neighborhood, sleepy town,
A harmless woman, a deed conceived and executed in cold blood,
Oh, no, Gawain, would that it were simple,
What we gonna do?
Give the money back and go to church?
I shudder, I quake,
You, sir, are a Buddhist,
Is there not a "middle" way?
Must float like a leaf on the river of life,, and kill old lady,
Yes, yes, I suppose you are right,
It is the active nature of the crime, though, that so abhors,
The squeezing of the trigger, the plunging of the knife,
But, let us think a moment,
What other tools do we have at hand?
We have the cellar,
We have the cavity,
We have masonry and trowel,
Perhaps we could simply, immure her,
Sure, Easiest thing in the world, I can whip up a little mortar in a snow saucer,
Lay the bricks, Anchor in some chains,
Mountain Girl could outsource the manacles,
Ah, gentlemen, gentlemen, we delude ourselves,
No, shortest and painless is best,
Gawain' s gun, retort muffled by a pillow, into the brain, (claps) The affair of an instant,
The only question is who wields the weapon?
I believe it is traditional in such circumstances to draw straws,
Fair enough, Here you go, Lump,
I' m thinkin ', though, that since I lost a finger -
- and I mean literally lost it 'cause of that fuckin' cat - maybe I should be excused from this thing,
Hard for me to squeeze a trigger anyway,
You one whiny muthafucka,
I' il come over there and squeeze your fuckin 'nutsack, you keep that bullshit up,
Shut up, punk!
- I' il kick your goddamn ass, sweet- legs!
- Gentlemen!
No special pleading, No exceptions,
It is of the nature of the situation we would all prefer to be excused,
Well, OK, it was just a trial balloon,
Long straw, You all see it, All that fuss for nothin ', punk,
Fuck you,
Motherfuck!
Lord, I' m troubled
Lord, I' m troubled
Lord, I' m troubled Oh, Lord, by my soul
My Lord, but when I get up in the Kingdom, Lord
I won’ t be troubled no more
- Oh, Lord, I' m troubled - Lord, I' m troubled
Lord, I' m troubled
- (TV) Oh, would you like a hot cross bun?
- No, just an explanation.
Coming up!
- Ouisie, I' il take some cocoa.
- Hi, George.
What' s goin 'on?
George!
How did they get in here?!
(raucous laughter)
- What you got there, Gawain?
- Why, nothin ', Mama,
Nothin ', my ass!
You got a dog there!
- No, Mama, - A filthy, noisy little pest of a puppy dog
- gonna shit all over the house!
- He won' t shit in the house, Mama,
I' m gonna train him, I promise, I' il train him real good!
I' m gonna train you real good!
You wait till your daddy get home, He gonna lay into you proper!
No, Mama!
Please, Mama!
I love you!
Your daddy gonna kick yo 'ass!
Mama' s whuppin 'Gawain' s ass!
Ain' t you gonna use the strap, Mama?
I love you, Mama, I' m sorry, Mama, I love you,
Yeah, I' il wipe the dog' s ass and everything, Mama,
I' il train him to shit in the toilet, Mama,
- I' il wipe his ass and everything, Mama, - What you doin '?
What you doin 'with my pillow?
- Ugh!
- I' m displeased with you!
- Yeah, but, - Fine colored boy like you
- fallin 'in with that trash downstairs!
- Ugh!
Now, I know your mama taught you better than that!
I can' t do it, She remind me of my mama,
- Look, man, - Why, this is most irregular,, y' all muthafuckas just gonna have to draw straws again,
Wait a minute, You' ve got to accept your responsibilities, young man, and shoot that old lady,
Hey, man, fuck you and your irritated bowel!
Must shoot,
Now, look here, it' s the easiest thing in the world,
Just pretend her head' s a casaba melon and the gun is a melon baller,
What the fuck are you talkin 'about?
A melon baller?
- Look, man, you do it, - Oh, this is most irregular,
Now, look, with equal rights comes equal responsibility,
I' m afraid Mr, Pancake is correct, We cannot draw straws again,
The exercise would lose all credibility if you show the loser can simply beg off,
Must shoot,
Hey, look, man, she' s just an old colored lady to you,
Come on, man, you do it,
- Why, you sniveling little coward, - What did you say to me?
- Sniveling little coward, - You whiny muthafucka,
I will come up yo 'stankin', irritated asshole with this gun and give you a lead colonic, muthafucka!
You think you scare me, you mewling punk?
You don' t scare me, Bull Connor and all his dogs didn' t scare me!
Now, be a man,
You ain' t no fuckin 'man!
- Oh, my, this is most distressin ', - Be a man!
You ain' t no fuckin 'man!
Fuckin 'a 60- year- old with pigtails!
Why, you bastard punk!
Mountain Girl is 53!
- She could ride your ass to jelly!
- Oh, yeah?!
- I seen Virginia hams
I' d rather stick my dick in than that big ol 'white chick!
Oh, my God,
Oh, no,
Oh, my,
- I think he' s hit, - (Lump) Oh, no,
I' il just check the carotid artery,
- That' s a negative, - Is he dead, Professor?
Oh, sure he' s dead, Lump, I just checked his carotid artery, (Dorr) Well, this is most irregular,
We shall need a Hefty bag,
She is in the kitchen,
You steal out with the carcass while I dazzle her with conversation,
My dear Mrs, Munson, I have outlined your position with my colleagues, and I now return to you to render our collective verdict,
There was much spirited discussion and an atmosphere of frank give- and- take,
Some of our number were initially appalled at your proposal that we simply return the money, Some were more receptive,
I don' t care if they was receptive or not!
And that attitude, madam, was a factor in our discussions,
To a man, I must say they were devastated at the prospect of not being able to contribute to their respective charities,
- Well, that is a shame, - Indeed, but at the end of the day, your position prevailed,
So we have decided to return the money, every last cent of it, and attend Sunday services, rather than spend the remainder of our days wastin 'away at the Mississippi Men' s Correctional Facility, (thud)
Though that was the original preference of some,
You are not assistin 'with the cadaver,
Oh, no need,
Just chuck it off the bridge, Easiest thing in the world,
- I' m just cleanin 'up here, - (door shuts)
Oh!
That' s them, Back already,
I' il just go dump these in the hearse,
Yeah, easiest thing in the world,
General!
No extra share, huh?
- Mountain?
- Garth?
- (choking)
Oh, come
Let us go back
To God
- Go back to God - Oh, come on
- Let' s go back to God - Let us go back
- Let' s go back to God - Come on
Let' s go back to God
Get Garth,
Let us go back
To God
Go back to God
Excellent, I believe, at last, we have the right man for the job, (snoring) ("Weeping Mary")
They crucified the Savior
They crucified the Savior
They crucified the Savior
And nailed Him to the cross (song continues)
The old woman is a more formidable antagonist than one had imagined, (foghorn blowws)
Now, Lump, it falls to you to finish the job,
- The comedy must end, - You know,
- I' ve been doin 'some thinkin', Professor, - Oh, dear,
Maybe we should be goin 'to church, Maybe she is right,
Ooh, dear, Lump, I feared those would be your words,
Not that I don' t appreciate you giving the matter the benefit of your thought, but recall, my dear boy, our respective functions in this enterprise,
I am a professor, The professor, as you yourself so often say, The thinker,
Trained, in fact, in the arts of cogitation,
You, Lump, are the goon, the hooligan, the dumb brute, whose actions must be directed by a higher intelligence,
Yeah, I know, but,
Ah, ah, ah!
No buts, dear boy, Do not repeat the error of thinkin ',
Now is the moment of praxis, Now, Lump, you must act,
Well, I can' t do it, Professor, A nice old lady like that,
Think of the riches, Lump, that you and I alone shall divide,
Yeah, I know, but,
And reflect also that if you decline to act, thus forcin 'me to do so, you shall no longer have any entitlement to the money,
Your offices shall have been nugatory,
You mean you' re gonna kill her?
Of course, yes, My hand shall be forced,
I can' t allow you to do that, Professor,
You, allow?
Not allow?
What presumption!
You stupid boy!
You very, very, extremely stupid boy,
Oh, yeah?
Who looks stupid now?
No bullets?
Perhaps it had to be thus,
"Lo!
In yon brilliant window- niche
How statue- like I see thee stand, "
A raven,
” The agate lamp within thy hand! "
"Ah, Psyche, from the regions which
Are Holy Land! "
Professor?
Couldn' t face the music,
I appreciate that, but we don' t know what to do, Tried that, too,
Oh,
- Uh, Mrs, Munson, - Gotta make a statement, Sheriff,
Ma' am, could it possibly wait?
We' re kinda busy down here today,
Oh, well, I suppose it could wait, but it' s about that casino money,
Let me call you back, You know somethin 'about it?
Somethin '?
Everything!
I got it at home,
- You got what at home?
- The money! $1, 6 million dollars,
- It' s down in my root cellar, - How did it get there, Marva?
Well, a bunch of desperate men stole it and put it there, that' s how!
See, they was musicians of the Renaissance period, (chuckles) Turned out they really couldn' t play, but they could recite poems that' d break your heart,
- The ringleader spoke in dead tongues, - Does he now?
Oh, I tried to get you to see him,
- That night, - Yes, ma' am,
I had to holler at 'em about stealin' all that money,
'cause they just picked up and left without takin' the money!
And they let Pickles out!
So you want us to come over and fetch him,
Oh, no, no, he' s back,
What you want me to do with the money?
You keep it!
Why don' t you keep it?
- Keep it?
- Go on and keep it, Miss Marva,
Well,
It is just a penny off of everybody' s policy,
- Could,?
- You don' t suppose I could,?
- Yes, ma' am?
Could I just give it all to Bob Jones University?
Yeah, That' d be nice,
Give it all to 'em!
That' s a good idea!
As long as everybody knows, ("Let Your Light Shine on Me" by Blind Willie Johnson)
How you doin '?

Where should I take him?
Now is bad.
Why?
Someone gave birth to a green baby.
You really helped me.
Asano- kun?
He' s sleeping in his room.
I see.
Professor?
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
Are you really...
Zebraman?
It' s true.
You were in one of my dreams.
You healed a big wound.
I wanted to help you.
It seemed so real.
Professor...
Today...
I understood it.
The reason why I fight...
Is for dreams.
Not for my dreams, but for... but for his.
That' s what I believe.

"Crab Man"
"Green Baby"
Zebraman scripts.
What I' m about to tell you is surprising.
These scripts contain everything that' s been going on lately.
Crab Man.
Kids stealing cars.
Green baby.
Wait a second.
I heard nothing about those.
But, Prof. Kyoto knew about it all this time.
It' s all here.
Prof. Kyoto?
Yes.
He must know about Zebraman.
Hey, did you ever hear anything strange from the professor' s room?
No, I never did.
Too bad.
I think Kyoto knows what' s going on.
I think Kyoto is in alien hands.
Who told you that?
Wait a sec!
Find him.
Yes.
In Yokohama, 34 years ago, a UFO crash- landed.
The aliens mixed in with humans around the area of the junior high school.
Soon after, the alien' s began using the Zebraman scripts for their plans.
The program was cancelled early.
The UFO aliens used the junior high school to further their plans.
They began to further experiment on humans.
Prof. Kyoto began a one man fight against the aliens.
That' s why he wanted to transfer the students to another school.
He said...
What?
Anything goes.
He believed...
Dreams come true.
Kyoto is an alien.
But not just a normal alien.
He' s an original alien from the UFO.
Hey.
Yes?
We can' t let you interfere with our plans for invasion...
Seigawa...
Seigawa- san is dead.
I need a bike.
I should have a bike.
Heroes always have bikes.
Sorry.
Kazuki...
Your father...
Needs to fly to the sky...
Sorry.
And sister...
Take care of them.
Dad...
Do your best.
Did you read the script for the final episode?
No.
How about Asano- kun?
He didn' t read it either.
That' s good.
I don' t think I can fly.
When fighting the alien boss,
Zebraman
Gets defeated.
But then...
What happens?
Zebraman...
Flies into the sky.
Then he... saves the earth and humanity...
From the alien invasion.
That' s the final episode.
What the heck is that?
Who would watch such a show?
You' ve been practicing flying?
Yes.
How long?
10 days.
I think to fly...
is impossible.
I wish I never read that script!
My son believes in you.
He believes that Zebraman will protect the earth.
For my son' s sake...
learn how to fly!
Miss...
Yes.
Did you... understand my story?
Yes.
There is one man who can help.
Who is it?
It' s Zebraman.
It' s Zebraman!
You mean that striped guy?
Sounds weird, doesn' t it?
But I think he' s the only one who can help us.
No need.
The order has been given.
Tonight, the Junior High School will be no more.
Our operation will be over.
In a moment, the school will cease to exist.
I expect your support.
How can you say that?
Everyone has gone crazy.
It' s all we can do to survive.
Dad...
Do your best.
He believes.
Believes in dreams.
Believe in dreams, believe in dreams.
Why did you come here?
If something bad happened tell me...
No, no.
I had something important to tell you.
You should not give up.
I really believe that you are a big hero, defending the earth.
You look terrible.
Well, I' m sorry for saying such weird things.
Later.
Take care.
Shinpei?
Where are you, Shinpei?
Toilet?
Shinpei!
Please stop, please stop.
What is it?
We' re sorry, but the road is closed.
Why?
We' re sorry, no one can pass.
But my son went to the school...
Everything is in order here.
Please!
I need to go to the school!
You' re good, Professor.
Clear a path.
Open it, open it.
Let' s go.
To the school.
Get on.
Yes.
Asano- san.
Zebraman.
Help me, Zebraman!
Do your best, Zebraman!
Great!
Zebraman, look out!
You' re not gonna... keep me down.
Hey?
What' s going on?
Kazuki!
What?
Now what?
There' s only 3 minutes left until the chopper gets here!
Let' s clear out!
Shinpei!
Shinpei?
Shinpei!
What now?
Fly.
Zebraman, fly and fight.
Asano- san.
Zebraman has to fly.
Zebraman has to fly to the sky.
You have to believe that you can fly.
Asano- san...
See.
Now it' s Zebraman' s turn.
Zebraman!
Fly!
Shinpei!
Shinpei!
He flew.
Shinpei!
Thank you...
Zebraman.
Hey...
Can I ask you something?
What?
My mask...
I was finally having some fun.
Yes, yes.
Everything is fine now.
Japan is safe!
We' re here.
Here.
Everyone is waiting for Zebraman.
He looks like a fine man.
He doesn' t look like dad?
No way!
Don' t say such a thing!
Thank you, Zebraman!
Turn on the black and white.

They' re coming!
Prisoner 1719, JOO Young- ju, serving for fraud.
The warden has graded you very highly.
You' ve also worked very hard in the rehabilitation program.
Did you somehow know about the parole screening beforehand?
I' ve been doing woodwork for my rehabilitation.
I' m making a goose for my sister' s wedding gift.
Isn' t a goose a gift from the parents?
Isn' t it a blessing of fortune?
I have to do it for my sister.
On behalf of my deceased father.
On behalf of my working mother.
My sister was like both a father and mother to me.
I want to do everything for my sister.
I' m sorry.
Parole approved
What kind of crap is that?
lnner acting.
Don' t go overboard.
You look sad, but you restrain it, okay?
You constipated?
Ladies.
Just give up.
In these distrustful times, think it' s a piece of cake for people to trust you?
Get a life.
Think parole is that high almighty?
JOO Young- ju.
Yes, I' m ready!
Lying is a natural gift, you know.
Don' t try to force it.
Just wait it out here.
Bye!
I' il call you for sure!
You have to wait for me, okay?
Bye!
Take care!
She' s a real bitch, isn' t she?
Now you get the picture.
Too beauTiful To lie
Delicious!
Hi, this is Young- oak' s cell phone.
Excuse me...
Who?
- Young- ju?
- Who is it?
I don' t know.
She says she' s Young- ju.
- Hello?
- Tada!
It' s me sis, Young - ju!
Young- ju, what' s going on?
What do you mean?
I got out.
Hey, you don' t seem so happy.
- No, it' s just that...
- Who picked up the phone?
Your future husband?
Yeah.
Anyway, how are the preparations going?
I' m the one who picks out your dress, right?
You can' t pick it out yourself.
Not with that bad taste of yours.
I' m headed for Busan now.
I' il pick out a killer dress!
Just wait.
Now?
Why sound so surprised?
Pick the dress already?
Not exactly...
Young- ju.
All my in- laws are here, so I' il be okay.
Why don' t you take a rest?
Or go on a trip perhaps.
The wedding is still far away.
I just thought it' d be hard on you.
Yeah, I know how you feel.
It wouldn' t be because you' re embarrassed of me, right?
Since it' s not, then of course I should go.
Young- ju, I think you' ve misunderstood.
What can be misunderstood between us?
Oh yeah, tell them I' m studying abroad.
That I was in the U. S., Japan, and on my way from Southeast Asia.
That way you' il save face, right?
Young- ju!
I' m going now, so leave your phone on.
Even if it' s off, I' il find a way to find you.
Go!
Go!
Giddyup!
Giddyup!
Go!
Go!
We' re almost there!
- So what about the club?
- Don' t throw a Choco Pie.
So what' s that nightclub like?
My buddy at the nightclub...
Hold on!
Hold on!
- It' s not what you think!
- Yeah, right!
You pervert!
You bastard!
No, it was the ring!
Ring, my butt!
You see...
Anyway, what I did was not etiquette, but please understand.
I' m not the person you think I...
You repeated offenders never screw up your lines.
My name is CHOl Hee- chul.
I' m a pharmacist.
Pharmacist CHOl Hee- chul.
In Yongkang, I' m well- trusted, and I have many customers.
I know we won' t meet again, but I feel bad having to leave that type of memory with someone.
I' m not that low of a person.
This ring is my mother' s.
I' m on my way to propose to someone.
Over there...
My nose is bleeding.
Watch where you' re going?
Know what happens when you get into trouble on parole, right?
Stay away from any trouble.
No way that idiot...
He won' t pin it on me, will he?
- Guess who?
- What the hell?
- Who could it be?
- How the hell should I know?
Stop it, damn it!
Oh my!
I thought you were my boyfriend.
I mistook your flat head for my boyfriend' s.
- I' m sorry.
- You crazy woman!
Watch it, damn it.
My bag!
Hey!
Hey, my bag!
My bag!
Throw my bag!
Throw my bag!
Throw it to me!
Hey!
My bag!
My goose!
I don' t believe this.
No, it' s not CHOl Hee- chul' s.
He just has it with him.
Yeah.
Bye.
Miss, about your bag.
Looks like he didn' t hand it in to lost and found yet.
We' il contact you if he calls, so you should go home for now.
Yongkang Station
How will I ever find him here?
CHOl Hee- chul?
Hee- chul?
Hee- chul?
You know him?
Isn' t that the Hee- chul at Yongkang Pharmacy?
Yeah, that' s him.
You mean the Mayor' s son.
If it' s the Mayor' s son, then isn' t he your son' s friend?
Of course he' s friends with my Young- deuk.
Hee- chul was the top student, Young- deuk was the top bully?
There you go again with your crap!
Did I say something wrong?
Your son ripped Hee- chul' s forehead and his grandma went nuts.
That' s right, Hee- chul' s grandma adored him.
Sons are precious in that family.
His mother wanted to have a son, so she borrowed my panties for luck.
- Are you serious?
- Don' t you remember?
- Excuse me.
- All they have is one child?
No.
They have a daughter, too.
His mother had her and passed away.
Yeah, right after I had my Man- suk.
It' s been twenty years already!
Yeah, now I remember.
Hee- chul' s grandma was hoping for another son.
But after his weak mother died, the town scolded the grandma.
The town didn' t know anything.
Yeah, she was so good to Hee - chul' s mom.
That' s right.
Ladies?
Anyway, how do you all know so much?
This town is so small, we can count all the spoons, right?
So what about Hee- chul?
Yes?
I didn' t see Hee- chul at the drug store just now.
Why don' t you go directly to the Mayor' s home instead?
I' ve been a taxi driver in this town for ten years.
But I' ve never seen a pretty girl like you.
You could be an actress.
All kinds of people are pissing me off today.
So where can I take you, Princess?
To the Mayor' s home.
Why are you going to the Mayor' s home?
I' m gonna be his new daughter- in- law.
Wait just one moment.
What can I do for you?
I came to find CHOl Hee- chul.
Hee- chul?
You' re too late.
Hee- chul died a year ago.
Today' s his memorial.
Is this some horror flick?
Excuse me.
You said you came for Hee- chul?
Actually, what happened with this ring...
Hee- chul isn' t here right now.
But Hee- chul' s father is at the drug store now.
I' m Hee- chul' s aunt.
What can I do for you?
Mother, I' m your third son - in- law.
Goodness, you' re too late.
My third son- in- law died last year.
Oh, mother.
We have a guest.
She' s a bit senile.
Honey, hurry and take her to the drug store.
So you' re dating my son, Hee- chul?
Pardon?
Well, it' s not what it seems.
Go on with your business.
Hey!
If it' s not what it seems, then why do you have this ring?
It' s a bit complicated to explain.
Just think of it as a ring I picked up,
- so please call...
- Picked up?
This ring?
I think you' ve misunderstood.
Actually, I' m not in a position to tell you exactly what happened.
Aren' t you going home?
Darn door handle.
Oh, I see you have a guest.
Miss.
You appear out of the blue.
You bring this wedding ring, and you talk about my son.
Shouldn' t you explain exactly, so that I can fully understand?
You' re right, but...
What happened, you see...
I didn' t meet your son on good terms.
It' s partially my fault,
- but he made a mistake to...
- Mistake?
I just wanna return this ring.
I couldn' t reach him, so I came all the way here.
Wait, it sounds as if our Hee- chul did something wrong to you.
Why?
Pardon?
From what you said, my son is making some big mistake.
Isn' t that what you' re implying?
No, that' s not what I mean.
Looks like a new face to me.
Who the heck is this girl?
How did you meet my boy?
Who are you, Miss?
You' re all so mean.
Don' t ask me anything anymore.
How are you?
I' m so glad to meet you.
I' ve heard a lot about you from Hee- chul.
What' s wrong with her?
Officer Kim!
Bring the stretcher!
Yes, sir.
Why isn' t the door opening?
The door usually opens from the outside in a police car.
Open the door!
So Hee- chul said she' s his girlfriend?
I don' t know exactly.
Come on and tell me.
Then whose girl would it be?
His dad' s?
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday, dear jae- eun!
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday, Jae- eun.
I don' t know everything.
Just that he mentioned her a few times not long ago.
What makes you sure it' s her?
Mom' s ring.
Actually, Hee- chul had it for a long time.
You know how corny he can be.
He was going to propose with it.
You must be so happy.
You always said you wanted a daughter - in- law.
Go see how she is.
I should' ve just finished my time.
Marriage fraud on parole?
It' s getting worse by the minute.
I' m looking after the patient that just left.
I swear she said that she' il be his daughter - in- law.
- Really?
- I' m serious.
Anyway, why did she faint?
Wait a minute!
At three months, it' s important to be careful.
To avoid a miscarriage, meals must be eaten regularly.
What did you say?
Oh goodness, then it all fits.
In other words, Hee - chul did that to that girl.
Then she became that way, and...
You' re right.
So Hee- chul made a mistake first.
And she said it was partially her fault.
But regardless, that rotten Hee- chul...
I lack readiness.
For you, I lack appearance.
I lack courage.
For you, I lack life.
But I pray I can be only for you.
With this ring...
Our family is a bit peculiar.
Whenever something comes up, we all rush in like that, and take the wind out of people.
Yeah, they seem a bit different.
But other families are very envious of us.
You know, city people aren' t like that.
I guess you' re right.
Yes?
I bet you' re very uncomfortable.
I' m okay.
I' m sorry about today.
Since you came to see Hee - chul anyway, feel at home and we' il talk when he comes back.
Get some rest.
Yes, good night, Father.
Father?
Father?
A bastard like me shouldn' t be alive, right?
loses the ring.
That' s me.
Why me?
Anyway, do you think Jae - eun' s mad?
Her face looked pissed off.
No way.
She left smiling.
Actually, it was fun.
Isn' t it yours?
You got a call.
Where?
Who the hell' s calling?
Hello?
Yes, sir.
Yes, hello.
One moment.
Hey, it' s your dad.
It' s me, Father.
Where are you now?
I' m still in Busan.
You have a girlfriend?
How did you know that?
When will you be back?
Well, I still have some things to do.
You' re hiding out, aren' t you?
- Sir?
- I' il keep this short!
Come back tomorrow!
Yes, sir...
Hiding out?
What are you talking about?
We have to hold her here no matter what.
What if she goes and have an abortion?
Then we' ve committed a sin.
No, I won' t see it.
Like he said, we must hold her here by all means.
Hurry outside.
Go home and get some rest.
You did great today.
Boy, I' m exhausted.
- What a day, huh?
- She' s pretty, huh?
Very pretty.
Why do I feel so worn out?
Over that?
It all worked out anyway.
He can marry Hee- chul off and have grandkids.
It certainly is a blessing.
I wish mother can hug a great grandchild soon.
- Want another kid?
- Be quiet.
- Hurry and hop in.
- Okay.
Long, long, time ago, there lived Sun Boy and Moon Girl.
But a tiger tried to eat them.
As Sun Boy and Moon Girl tried to run away, a rope suddenly fell from the sky.
Sun Boy and Moon Girl went up on the rope.
Damn it, this is a long story.
The tiger fell and died.
So what happened next?
- Sis!
- Yes?
- It' s Soo- mi.
- Yes, one sec '.
What' s wrong with your voice?
Are you in pain?
No!
Oh, what a hot night.
I thought you' d be here longer.
Going back for the ring?
No, my father told me to hurry and come back.
You' re so sweet.
I' m not sweet.
I' m stupid.
Anyway...
Have you thought about it?
About coming down to Yongkang.
You' re talking about Yongkang again?
Your proposal didn' t mean that we were going to apply for Seoul Hospital together?
Of course, it does.
It' il freshen up your head a bit.
I' il go.
Where?
Yongkang.
I' il go as soon as possible.
Hey, what' s with you?
Since you answered so easily, it sounds like a lie.
The Mayor is so lucky.
Fate brought her here.
- He longed for a daughter- in- law.
- Fate works in wonders.
You' re right.
He likes her more because she' s pretty.
Help yourself to plenty.
Thank you very much, Father.
Goodness, she said father.
Yes.
"Thank you, Father."
Say your welcome to your daughter- in- law.
Are you all having a party?
You don' t even know the whole story.
Then...
I heard you wanted to go to a spa.
Yes?
I just mentioned that you wanted a bath.
There' s a famous spa here.
No, I didn' t really mean it.
Usually, you' re supposed to go with the in- laws.
That way you' il get close faster.
Yes, Hee- chul will take a while, so let' s go to the spa.
But I don' t feel so well.
Yeah, it is far though.
It' il only take 15 minutes by car.
A new spa opened by the bus terminal.
Who goes to the spa with in- laws lately?
It was only during our time.
I' il go to the spa!
I want to take Grandmother and go with the family.
Wonderful!
Be careful!
Please watch your step!
You should' ve held her!
Stop overreacting.
Let' s go in.
Does Hee- chul know what state your body' s in?
No, not yet.
Why didn' t you tell him?
That' s how you seize his heart.
I see.
Where' s the restroom?
Want me to go with you?
- I' il just go on my...
- No, you must be extra careful at this time.
Soo- mi!
Go with her to the restroom.
Okay.
No, I' il just change here.
So why did they go to the spa all of a sudden?
Hee- chul.
Yes?
I' m very disappointed in you.
What?
I' m telling you this now that you' ve grown up.
Before I married your aunt, I had many women all over me.
But do you know why I married your aunt?
No.
She was carrying a baby like you are now, you fool.
Auntie is carrying my baby?
Welcome!
Attention customers!
Looking for Mister cHol Hee- chul' s fiancee.
Mister cHol Hee- chul' s fiancee. please come to the reception desk. she' s impersonating as my fiancee,
I tell you I' m on the air, damn it!
What' s this noise?
I don' t know.
Where did she go?
That woman...
Welcome!
You!
It' s you from the train, right?
I' ve finally found you.
But what are you doing here?
It' s all because of that darn ring.
- I don' t have time to...
- Ring?
How did you...
Wait, then you' re the one
- who' s swindling as my fiancee.
- Swindling?
Don' t screw with me, and just give me my bag.
Now I see that you stole my ring.
Your ring is with your father.
Just tell me where my...
Know what happened to me because of you?
Why' d you steal my ring?
Are you done talking?
No!
What did I do to you to deserve this?
Now I see that you hitting me was all an act.
I see you' re a real pro!
A pro!
I warned you, didn' t?
Do you know you' re screwing with me?
I screwed with you, so what?
Is screwing with you that important now?
After what happened to me,
- does it matter that I screw...
- You rotten bastard!
Are you that proud of screwing a girl?
Is that what I taught you?
I swear I don' t know her.
Father, I' m your son!
You' ve raised me for over twenty years.
Don' t you trust me?
Then why is she doing this?
That' s what I want to know, too.
Hey you!
Why the hell are you doing this?
How can she talk if you bully her like that?
Don' t you know she' s expecting?
This is driving me nuts.
Uncle.
Shouldn' t you sense that something' s wrong?
Well, you could have a point.
Well, but it does seem like there' s some reason we don' t know.
Everything is all my fault.
I wouldn' t have caused any trouble.
Yes.
I' ve lied.
See?
I told you so.
I told you so.
Frankly, I' m not the girl from Hee- chul' s pharmaceutical school.
But my love for Hee- chul was true.
Actually, I didn' t go to college.
I couldn' t say anything, knowing I couldn' t compete.
I prayed that he' d come back, but he cut me off entirely.
Rotten bastard.
Uncle.
I' m very sorry.
I just wanted to return the ring, and not mention these things.
Although it was brief, you all were so good to me.
I' m sorry to disappoint you.
Sit back down.
- It' s okay, Father.
- Father?
Sit down.
Yes, sir.
I' m not saying this because I don' t trust you.
I' m just asking this because I need to know for sure.
Can you tell us whatever you know about Hee- chul?
Yeah!
Great idea, Father!
How about this instead?
Ask for her lD number and find out who she really is!
Are we?
Idiot!
Hee- chul, do I have to do this?
Be frank and say that you don' t know.
How would you know when we only met once on the train?
That he' s a precious son.
When did I say that?
Hee- chul' s mother went through so much trying to bear Hee- chul.
Hee- chul' s mother did everything possible.
She even borrowed panties from a woman who bore many sons.
He said that his mother went through so much to bear him.
His grandmother was so good to his mother.
Hee- chul' s grandmother was very misunderstood.
Poor girl!
Poor girl...
Grandma, please stop crying.
This is impossible!
Father!
Aunt...
Soo- mi, you told her, didn' t you?
This is fishy.
She has to talk about me!
Say something about me, okay?
Hee- chul was a good student.
To be frank, Hee - chul brags too much.
Sometimes I think he' s poking fun at me.
Uncle!
One time he bragged so much he got into a fight.
His name was Young... something.
Young- deuk.
That' s right.
I don' t need to see it to know.
He probably got hit after bragging about his grades.
That gave him the scar on his forehead.
That' s why his grandmother went into a frenzy.
You still call her a fraud after that?
How did you know that?
You rotten bastard!
Punish me instead, Father!
Hee- chul keeps insisting on an abortion.
But I can' t do it alone.
I' m sorry, Father!
What?
You rotten bastard!
I told you not to screw with me, didn' t I?
How did you first meet Hee- chul?
Well...
Was it a sunny day?
Or a rainy day?
It did seem to have snowed.
Anyway, I was drinking tea.
I think Hee- chul was using the phone.
Oh my!
I don' t care about a measly wallet.
Thanks to you, I' ve gained a precious encounter.
I run a drug store in Yongkang.
A pharmacist.
I' m CHOl Hee- chul.
How slimy.
That' s really how you met him?
Think slimy was all?
I learned a lesson then.
Don' t ever jump into someone else' s business.
Love is so strange, considering what can be overcome.
Don' t you think?
So what work do you do now?
I' m taking a rest.
Then what did you do before?
I was just...
I worked for a certain government organization.
So you' ve come on your own feet.
Now I don' t have to climb in through the window.
Didn' t you hear my father say not to even step into the house?
Why is my father your father?
Who says so?
From what I know, he' s not your father after today.
It' s just the two of us, so why don' t we be frank.
What do you want?
My bag.
Your bag?
Because I' m in a certain bind, I can' t either stay or go.
It' s a real drag to be here, you know?
You remember my bag, right?
What would I know about your bag?
Did you leave it with me?
How could you say that?
I went to retrieve your ring, but I' m paying for it now.
So shouldn' t you try to remember at least?
Oh yeah, the ring.
I don' t know how precious that crappy bag was, that ring was on that day?
- That crappy bag?
- Yeah!
That crappy bag with the ragged handle.
All I need to do is buy you a new bag.
But how will you make up for what' s happened to me?
So you don' t know where it is?
You don' t even know what was inside it.
That crappy bag?
Fine.
I' il wait here until you find it.
I don' t have any place to go anyway.
How dare you?
Are you threatening me?
Oh boy, I can' t wait to see what happens!
You have no sense at all!
You beast!
How could you hit a woman?
You' re a beast!
Die, you beast!
I' m hungry.
Stay for a long, long time, okay?
Yes, Grandma.
Hello!
- Going to work?
- Yes.
Are you preparing well for the contest?
- Of course.
- No matter what, you have to win for the town, okay?
Yes, don' t worry.
Have a nice day!
Hi, on your way somewhere?
I played a lot when I was young, but I never abandoned my wife!
Not a single man did well after abandoning his wife!
For your father at least, if you keep acting up...
That hurt!
Cover your stomach when you go to bed.
Be a nice boy.
Promise me.
Lightning will strike you down.
Right mom?
Make a woman cry, and lighting will strike you down.
You were right.
She' s really pretty.
I' m so envious.
The books are too old.
They have nothing to look at, so they just play.
Last time I estimated, we need 4 million won to fill it up with books.
Why do I have to come into my own room like this?
Hey!
Wouldn' t someone take this wrong?
Why the hell are you doing this to me?
Find my bag fast.
I don' t have much time either.
- Why do you think that bag...
- Mother!
Mother, where are you?
Mother, are you upstairs?
Mother!

Okay, that' s good.
- So do you like {y: i} Dysfunction?
- What?
- The show?
Do you watch the show?
- Yeah, of course.
So, here' s the deal.
You' re Marie- France... a French foreign- exchange student from France.
You' re staying with the Parkers, and you' re a little Gallic hottie, all right?
- Buttery little croissant.
- A toasty little bagel.
Okay, and Cody, naturally, wants to get all up in that ass soup.
- You know what I' m saying?
- Yeah.
Do I have to wear these shoes?
My feet are killing me.
- They' re French.
- Okay, so look, we know that you can dance.
So I want you to go ahead and grab that over there.
You' il drop the French bread, and you' il say the line:
"Oh- la- la, I' ve dropped my baguette!"
You wiggle your little tushy in front of the audience... as you bend over to pick it up, and presto!
A star is born.
You think you can handle that?
- Do you want me to do it now?
- Yeah.
Oh- la- la.
I' ve dropped my baguette!
All right, that was excellent.
That was beautiful.
That was very nice.
I liked the accent, very authentic.
Thank you.
We' re done here.
We' il call you.
You can leave now.
Don' t try to walk off with those shoes, now.
They belong to the show.
I' il be interviewing some students... sitting in on some classes, gathering footage.
We' il make sure to be as unobtrusive as possible.
Miss Klein, let me be frank.
The school board approved this, not me.
I' m uncomfortable with the idea of cameras at Roxbury.
A lot of very important people send their very important kids here.
- Believe me, Mr. Mayer...
- Meyer.
Think of the wiener.
Okay.
Mr. Meyer, you have nothing to worry about.
We' re talking about a harmless little human interest piece on the local news.
Believe me, they' re not looking for anything remotely controversial.
Otherwise, why would they assign it to me?
Okay, we' re done now.
Guess I' il see you in two weeks.
- Excellent.
- Come in.
God damn it, Meyer, the kids keyed my car again!
- Sorry to interrupt.
- That' s all right, we' re done.
Miss Klein, this is Roger Nicholl, a Law and Civics teacher here at Roxbury.
- Hello.
- Hi, there.
Okay.
She' s a dyke.
Symbiotic, that' s what our relationship is going to be like, Randa.
Just like we learned in biology:
The whale, and the little fish that sticks on it.
If you hang with me, you' il get a lot of attention from boys... that you otherwise wouldn' t.
Meanwhile, when I' m standing next to you, I look more attractive by comparison.
- Isn' t that great?
- Very nice.
It' s a constant struggle for us girls who don' t conform to the Western ideal... of blonde hair, and blue eyes, and an hourglass figure.
You know, my best friend Brittany, whom you' il meet soon, is so lucky.
She' s three for three.
Me, I could dye my hair, but nobody respects a bottle blonde.
I am slim, however, and my breasts are coming along nicely... though not as nicely as my friend Brittany' s, whom you' il meet soon.
You' re very lucky that I' m doing this for you.
I know you probably have an impression of American high school girls... being mean and spiteful... and it' s a reputation that' s largely deserved, believe me.
But I' m not like that at all.
I really try to be a good person.
The same as my best friend Brittany, whom you' il meet soon.
So here' s your first survival tip:
This is Beverly Hills, so a lot of the kids that go here... have rich and famous parents, and it' s good to know who' s who.
Like, that' s Josh Horowitz.
His dad is the famous lawyer Larry Horowitz.
He defended that baseball player who killed his wife.
He got him off, too... even though they found him running around... covered in blood with a baseball bat, screaming, "I killed the bitch!"
And that' s Lenora Fincher.
Her mom was the spokesmodel for this perfume company... but then she got old and they fired her.
And that' s Terry something.
His parents aren' t famous, so nobody talks to him.
I do, though, 'cause I' m a good person.
- It' s Dave.
- That smells good, what is that?
- Sfeha.
Would you like some?
- Is it fattening?
- I don' t know.
I' m on a diet.
I better play it safe.
I' m organizing this International Food Fair... to raise money for the Drama Club next week.
- You must participate.
Will you?
- Okay.
Bonus.
My hope is that the Fair will not only raise money for the Drama Club... but also, kind of, foster a spirit of togetherness... among the multicultural community here at Roxbury.
I have respect for all races... but I' m very glad that I was born white.
As a woman, it' s the best race to be... especially if you want to become an actress, like I do.
If I wasrt white... then the next thing I' d want to be is Asian, because a lot of men like Asian girls... because they think they' re docile, and sweet, and subservient... which I don' t really think is true... because I once met this Asian girl at summer camp... and she was a real bitch.
'cause I' ve always wanted to be a gospel singer... and also black men are more forgiving if your butt gets big.
like Vanessa Williams or Halle Berry.
Any time you have a sentence consisting of two clauses... the second being introduced by a conjunction or by a relative...
And finally, you know, Randa, no offense or anything... but my very last choice would be an Arab.
Truth be told, you' re not in a very enviable position.
There' s a lot of resentment in this country towards the Middle East... a lot of stereotypes floating around, which I don' t really think are true... because in the short time I' ve known you, you haven' t tried to bomb anybody... and you currently smell okay to me.
But people will laugh at you... and probably make fun of that thing you wear on your head.
- This is my hijab.
I must not remove it.
- I know that.
But people are ignorant.
To give you an example, there' s this joke going around.
- How does an Arab get his wife pregnant?
- I do not know.
She gets naked and lies down on the bed.
He jerks off on the wall, and they let the flies do the rest.
Don' t laugh.
It' s insulting to your people.
Miss Joyce?
Thank you.
Article or a preposition which pertains to every member of a series... must either be used only before the first term of the series... or before each and every term.
I had a half- brother named Sean, who died in "Operation Iraqi Freedom."
He was from my dad' s first marriage... and I' m a product of his second.
He' s now in his third.
Anyway, they told my dad that Sean died from friendly fire... and he refused to believe them.
He said that Iraqis are the ones who killed him.
I made the point of saying, "Why would our own government lie...
"and say he was killed by friendly fire...
"if Iraqis were the ones who killed him?"
- He said I was too young to understand...
- Miss Joyce.
There should be exactly one conversation going on in this classroom, and that' s me... talking.
Technically, Mr. Anderson, that' s not a conversation.
All right, here' s one for you, I' il see you in detention.
- But I...
- And you, too.
- Me?
- Yes, you.
- Her name' s Randa.
- Yes, of course it is.
All right.
Which brings us to the principal of parallel construction.
Namely, that expressions that are similar in content and function...
Sorry, Randa.
It' s unfortunate that we both have detention with Mr. Anderson... but on the other hand, it' s only going to prolong our day together.
- Hey, Arab chick, you wanna buy a gun?
- Get lost you unkempt miscreant!
Stay away from Kenny, the arms dealer.
It' s kids like him that give this great nation of ours a bad name.
You are very wise, Kimberly.
I am most fortunate to have met you.
Randa, that' s so sweet.
Come on.
You know, Brit, I was watching girls go by in their convertibles...
I' d say about 75% to 85% of them were what we call beautiful.
- But you want to know a secret?
- What?
They' re ugly on the inside, not like you.
You' re special.
Your kind of beauty lasts forever.
- Hi!
- Barry, get off me!
Randa, this is Barry.
Barry' s technically my boyfriend, except I don' t like him.
So, Kimberly, Trevor McNeill has the funniest shit on his locker.
It' s this poster with all these reasons why beer is better than a woman.
One of the reasons was:
Beer doesn' t talk.
- No, that wasrt it.
- It' s okay, Barry.
- Trev, yo, what' s up, man?
- Barry plays football.
- Girlfriend.
- Girlfriend.
- How was the Dysfunction audition?
- I' m not holding my breath.
It' s so hard to stand out from all the other aspirants, you know?
Yeah.
So, Brittany, this is Randa.
Randa' s from the Middle East.
She' s really sweet.
- She doesn' t say much, though.
I know all about the immigrant experience, how hard it can be.
I' m Canadian.
So where were you all day?
Truant with Troy.
- You look high on happy pills.
- God, Kimberly, he' s a poet.
Everything that comes out of his mouth is like an iambic pentagram.
- Who is Troy?
- Who' s Troy?
He' s only the hottest hottie of all the hotties at Roxbury.
That' s what my mother called "damning with faint praise."
Kimberly and Troy used to go out.
Now that Troy and I are together... she could have been a green- eyed monster... but instead she' s been really sweet about it.
Brittany, I wouldn' t ruin our friendship over a boy.
- Wonder Twins.
- Wonder Twins.
Brittany and I are the best of friends.
We confide in each other.
Like the other day...
Brittany confided that she feels dirty when she masturbates... but I told her it was normal and healthy, even when you do it as much as she does.
I forgot to tell you, they' ve posted the cast for {y: i} Anne Frank.
Really?
Well, who' s Anne?
I don' t know, silly.
I waited for you.
Come on.
Come on, Randa.
- I' m sorry, Brittany.
- Don' t be.
Personally, I think you deserved it way more.
Kimberly, you' re a way better actress.
You always have been.
- You know, Margot is a really good role.
- Yeah.
And everybody knows that Anne Frank was a brunette.
So if you played her you' d have to dye your hair.
You wouldn' t want to do that, would you, Brittany?
You' re so cute as a blonde.
That' s true.
Troy is playing Peter Van Daan.
That means I' il have to kiss him.
I hope you won' t be jealous.
- Well, it' s just acting, right?
- Yeah, of course.
I still feel bad, though.
Well, don' t, Kimberly.
I' m really happy for you.
I mean, if it couldn' t be me, I' m glad it' s you.
You' re my best friend, Brittany.
I say we go to Fred Segal and do some damage.
It sounds keen, but I gotta pass.
Randa and I have DT with Mr. A.
- Be careful.
- Careful?
Mr. Andersors kind of weird, especially around girls.
We think he' s a podiatrist.
Ignore her, she thinks everybody' s hot for her nubile bod.
- So anyway, Margot, we' il catch you later.
- All right, Anne.
- Down with Nazis!
- Boo, Nazis!
Daddy, I have some news.
I' m going to be playing Anne Frank in the school play.
The school play?
I thought that you want to be a movie star.
Daddy, I have some news.
I' m going to be playing Anne Frank in the school play.
Jew broad, right?
Anne Frank?
She was Jewish?
Can I just say this, okay?
In my office...
I wouldn' t mind if it was 30%, 40%, maybe even 70%... but ever since we took the company public... being in a board meeting is like being in a fucking synagogue!
I hear the suffixes of the surnames around me, and it' s all like... bloom, berg, witz, stein, gold, schtickman, hackman...
You know, I swear to God, I feel threatened.
I' m not kidding, that' s how I feel.
I feel like a minority.
Kathy?
Kimberly, we' ve talked about this.
I would really like it if you' d start calling me Mom.
- Kathy?
- No.
- Yes, Kimberly?
- Do you fuck dogs?
You know they' re just looking for an excuse.
They' re looking for an excuse to fire me, just looking.
Sometimes I hear them talk and I think, they' re communicating with each other... in some kind of secret Yid- code that I' m not privy to.
I swear to God.
Eat your moo shoo pork by the way.
It' s delicious.
- I don' t like this kind.
- It' s fucking delicious.
Eat it.
Last week' s meeting, there' s a guy there, he' s coughing, right?
He starts coughing, like a coughing fit.
You know, a fucking, coughing Kike, right?
I' m sitting here, I' m looking, I' m thinking... is he, like, coughing in fucking Yiddish or something?
Like, listen to this...
Wait till Hank turns his back... and then stab him with a {y: i} dreidel!
- Kathy?
- Yes.
Do you fuck dogs?
It' s like the fucking {y: i} Titanic.
We hit an iceberg, fucking ridiculous.
This is interesting.
I read about this.
This is a phase.
It' s called repetition.
It' s when they feel the need to repeat things.
Kathy?
I got it.
Fine.
Kimberly, listen to me.
Okay?
I' m going to say something to you.
There is a difference between bonafide racism... and just speaking the truth, which is what I' m doing here.
You understand that, right?
A big difference.
Okay?
Because racism, true racism, stems from ignorance.
It is ignorant.
Now, I don' t want to ever catch you being a racist.
This is not to say you have license to bring R. Kelly home for dinner, okay?
- Or banging some fucking beaner!
- Hank!
No, I' m just saying that I' m scared... that she' s going to repeat some of this shit at school.
And I know, because these teachers, you know, hear it... these fucking dykes, lesbians, these feminists at the school system... with their fucking rectal- ranger buddies, you know:
"Oh, it' s the parents' fault.
It' s the upbringing. "Right.
As if, what, kids couldn' t inerently be fucking complete assholes on their own?
And, by the way, no swearing.
When you were fucking my dog, he was going like this...
Now you are upsetting Bobo.
I just got him back from the Asthma Center.
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Hi, Mom.
- Hello?
Kimberly!
You know what this is?
They call, they hang up.
What?
At least she' s not jumping to some hook- nosed motherfucker...
Yeah, I got your card.
And my dog' s name is Bobo, not Bubbles.
And I actually turned 15.
I' m precocious.
Dad got me a digital video camera... so that he can tape my violin recitals and then watch them later... instead of actually attending them like a good parent would.
Mom, can you hang on a second?
I got another call.
Hello?
Kimberly, hey, it' s Barry.
Listen, I remembered a couple of those jokes.
{y: i} You know, {y: i} why beer is better than a woman?
Okay, great, Barry.
Can you hang on a second?
I' m on the other line with my mom.
{y: i} Sure.
Hello?
Hey, Mom, I' m back.
Already?
But we' ve only been talking for, like, a minute.
Okay.
Mom?
I love you.
Bye.
Okay, Barry, tell me.
Why is beer better than a woman?
I can' t remember.
You coming over?
Yeah, I' il be over a little later.
Okay?
Kimberly, how many times have I told you not to leave the table for a phone call?
And then when you were done fucking my dog... you laid down on my bed, all naked and sweaty, and you said:
"There' s nothing like hard canine cock to satisfy my desires."
So, how' s school?
I gotta go.
- Where?
- Out.
- With who?
- My ass crack!
Okay, well, try to be back in time.
Hey!
Ass crack?
That' s interesting.
You know, anal fixation...
Is it theoretically possible for you to shut up for more than five seconds at a time?
Thanks, Barry.
That was nice.
You' re actually good at that when you remember to take your retainer out.
My turn.
Barry, I' m sorry, I gotta run.
I got homework, and I gotta start memorizing a bunch of lines.
- But we' il get you next time, okay?
- Next time?
You say that every time, "Next time."
I don' t know, Kimberly.
I' m not going to take this anymore.
You don' t treat me right.
This is not a balanced relationship.
- Next time, I' il go first, okay?
- Yeah, right.
God damn it!
I fall for it every time!
- I hate him!
I hate him so much!
- I know, I know.
I can' t believe he did that to me, in front of Troy, in front of everybody.
Look, he' s nothing.
He' s less than nothing.
He' s nobody.
I feel like I have this fire inside of me... and I just want to breathe it out, and I want to burn him.
I want to watch him burn.
He will, Brittany.
We' il burn him.
You and me.
How?
Tell me how?
We' il talk about it.
Just come over tonight.
I' ve invited Randa, too.
We' il all talk about it, okay?
Okay.
- I love you, Kimberly.
- I love you, too.
Come on.
Wait, no, put it back on.
I want to watch {y: i} The Real World.
Those girls are bitches.
- You' re a bitch.
- Yeah, well, you' re a trollop.
Fine.
- I' m sorry I called you a bitch.
- It' s okay.
I' m sorry I called you a trollop.
I don' t even really know what one is.
It' s a promiscuous woman, often a prostitute.
Okay.
It is time to open up my big bag of fun.
These are assorted items that I' ve stolen from Dad for our consumption this evening.
Dad' s wine- flavored cigars.
Don' t those things make you cough?
No, they' re cigars.
I mean, inale.
No, thanks.
Are you sure, Randa?
To become successful actresses you have to learn how to smoke them.
- It' s trendy.
- That' s true.
No, thank you, I do not smoke.
Okay.
Item number two:
One of Dad' s many, many pornos.
{y: i} Titty Lickers 2.
{y: i} The search for Golden Curlies.
- Why would we want to watch a porno?
- 'Cause they' re funny.
Besides, we have to teach Randa about sex, and this is the best way to learn.
And item number three... and I could get into real, real trouble if I got caught with these:
- Dad' s Twinkies.
- Too fattening.
Would you please stop criticizing everything in my big bag of fun?
I spent a lot of time putting this together.
Anyway, we can barf them up later, Queen of the Duh.
No, change the channel, I can' t watch this.
Martin Stivers.
- Who is Martin Stivers?
- You didn' t hear about it?
Some kid in a private school in Bel Air just walked into his cafeteria... with an assault rifle and opened fire.
- Killed, like, 10 kids.
- Twelve.
Hey, wait, that' s the reporter that' s doing the feature on our school.
- I hear she' s a lesbian.
- Really?
She doesn' t look like a lesbian.
What is a lesbian?
{y: i}... knows no racial or economic boundaries... {y: i} that violence can stretch {y: i} far beyond the limits of the inner city.
{y: i} Inside the school, there' s...
I have nightmares about this kid.
He wasn' t sorry for it, or anything.
And when they took him away, he was, like, laughing.
Rambo.
In some ways, I know how he feels.
I mean, there are just so many stupid, annoying... won' thless people on this planet.
They just, like, get in the way of what you want.
{y: i} The shooting took place between classes, {y: i} between the first and second...
Anyhow, let' s watch the skin flick.
Drink up, there.
I don' t want it to go to waste.
Thank you.
So I did take the car into the shop today.
- That was fun.
- That' s nice.
And I walked in, you know... and it was like this little rabbit being chucked into this den of foxes... and I swear they started licking their lips, you know, the moment...
At the sight of this middle- class woman... who obviously doesn' t know the first thing about cars... and can be completely taken advantage of, which is true.
- I don' t know the first thing about cars.
- Grace.
- And I' m sure I was taken advantage of...
- Grace.
- What?
- Happy Birthday.
- What' s the matter?
What is it?
- Nothing.
I was just...
I was just getting concerned... that maybe you didn' t get me anything.
And I know I' m supposed to say, "Oh, Percy, you shouldn' t have"... but you should have.
You definitely should have.
I know.
- What is it?
What is it?
- Open it.
It' s a little...
It' s a little skirt.
It' s so cute.
Actually, it looks like it goes very well with the blouse you' re wearing.
Actually, it does.
Thank you.
You want to try it on?
- Now?
- Okay.
Okay.
One sec, okay.
Here I go, one second.
Where are you going?
Why don' t you change right here?
We are married, for Christ' s sake.
If you want.
Okay.
- It' s a nice color.
- Yes.
Yep.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
- That' s...
- Good?
That' s...
- That' s very good.
- Really?
Actually, you' re right.
Thank you.
God, it reminds me of those skirts that the girls wear at your school.
Really?
Yeah.
I hadn' t...
I wouldn' t have noticed that.
That' s...
- One sec.
Don' t move.
- Okay.
Be right back.
I' m a little school girl.
I don' t want to be late for class.
I don' t want Mr. Anderson to spank me.
Yeah, that' s nice.
I have an idea.
Read this.
"Why I deserve to be punished."
Out loud.
You read it out loud.
"I have misbehaved.
"Some adjectives that could be used..." to describe my behavior... "include bad..." naughty, mischievous... "mischievous...
"nasty...
"and downright inconsiderate."
Oh, frisky.
I like this music.
Can you buy the soundtrack to pornos?
"Tiffany Minx, Stephanie Swift."
Brittany, a lot of these porn stars have names that sound like ours.
So if we wanted to, when we grow up, we could be porn stars.
- You couldn' t, Randa, I' m sorry.
- That is quite all right.
I would never want to be a porn star.
My sister' s ex- boyfriend, he lives in the Valley... he used to go out with one.
You know what they did?
They took the fat out of her butt and her arms, and they put it in her boobs.
Yeah.
How is it, please, that two men... at one time...
How can this be?
One of them is doing her up the butt.
Up the...
Such a thing is not possible.
It is too small, the aperture.
Kimberly, would you let someone do that to you?
I have.
- No, way!
- Yes, way.
- You' re such a liar.
Who?
- Warren.
- Warren Prescott?
- Affirmative.
How?
Last year.
We were sort of going out.
We were here, kind of getting drunk on my dad' s Captain Morgan... and he just kind of came right out and said...
We' ve been going out for three months now, and I really love you, and everything.
So I was wondering if you might let me pack your fudge chute.
At first I thought he wanted to make sundaes... {y: i} but then he elaborated.
{y: i} He was very polite about it.
{y: i} He said please three times.
{y: i} I couldn' t really bring myself to say no.
Well, what was it like?
It was okay.
Did it hurt?
Kind of.
But it hurt less with Warren than it might have with other boys...
- if you catch my drift.
- Kimberly!
- What is your drift?
- Never mind.
But you know what?
He said he doesn' t want to go out with a girl who' d let a guy do that to her.
- Does that make any sense?
- Boys are so weird.
Amen to that.
Wait a minute, I like this one.
{y: i} - Hi, Stephanie.
{y: i} - Hi.
{y: i} Are you here to help me change the oil?
{y: i} You know, I could never give up men, {y: i} because I like cock too much.
{y: i} But I don' t know... {y: i} sometimes I just feel like {y: i} I need a woman' s touch.
{y: i} I know what you mean.
Why is that woman...
Why is she doing those things with that other woman?
- Why must they show this?
- 'Cause men like to watch it.
But it is a sin.
Randa, you' re going to find out that a lot of things men like are a sin.
Kimberly, tell me you' ve never done that.
- Kimberly?
- What?
- You okay, Randa?
- Yes.
- Did you get it all out, every last calorie?
- Yes, I think so.
Good.
Kimberly?
You and Troy never actually, like, did anything, right?
No.
Brittany, for the 20 millionth time... me and Troy never, like, did anything.
- And it' s' cause Troy didn' t want to, right?
- Right.
Brittany, you know that.
That' s why I dumped him.
It' s just weird, 'cause with me he' s, like, insatiable.
I wonder why that is?
I' m finished.
Okay, girls, it' s time to get serious.
Oh, no, you' re not going to make us write...
I swear, most of those people deserve to be in prison.
No.
Okay, just listen to me.
It seems that all three of us have something in common.
Do you know what that is?
Our health, happiness, and faith in God.
No, I' m talking about Mr. Anderson.
What about him?
He' s done stuff to all three of us.
I hate him.
I hate him so much!
- Yes, he is a bad man.
- I know, girls.
So I' ve been thinking.
I' ve been thinking that maybe it' s about time we put a stop to him.
Remove all jewelry, watches, earrings, rings... and place them in the box.
You know the drill, people.
A metal detector at Roxbury?
Yeah, everybody' s freaked out 'cause of what happened over in Bel Air.
They don' t want it to happen here, I' m sure.
They figured it out.
Ain' t nobody safe, no matter how rich you are.
Ain' t nobody safe.
Next!
Are you sure about this, Kimberly?
I' m scared.
Don' t be.
We' re doing the right thing.
They' re going to try and discredit us, and turn us against each other... but we have to stand firm, okay?
We have to stick together, no matter what.
Okay.
Then we' il watch him burn.
- Okay.
- Let' s do it.
{y: i} Behind me lies one of L. A. County' s {y: i} most exclusive private schools.
{y: i} Roxbury Academy in Beverly Hills.
A safe haven for the children of the rich and the privileged.
A place where they can study in peace and harmony... free from the troubles that plague many of the regiors public schools... {y: i} until today.
{y: i} Because, today, this hallowed institution... {y: i} was rocked on its very foundations {y: i} with allegations of sexual assault.
{y: i} The accused, Percy Anderson... {y: i} an English and Drama teacher... {y: i} and new addition this year {y: i} to Roxbury' s distinguished faculty.
{y: i} The alleged victims... three 15- year- old sophomore girls... all of whom have waived their right to anonymity.
{y: i} Their names are, Kimberly Joyce, {y: i} Brittany Wells, and Randa Azzouni.
I will continue to bring you more of the details... of this stunning story as it unfolds.
For {y: i} Team 33 News, this is Emily Klein in Beverly Hills.
Okay, cut.
That was fucking great!
You were so fucking good!
{y: i} I can' t believe this is happening.
How are we going to afford a lawyer, on what we make?
What kind of a country are we living in when a trio of little tramps... can besmirch an innocent mars name with completely fabricated accusations?
Wow, that was really good use of the word besmirch.
Thank you.
Guys, what would you say if I told you I got a lawyer?
I mean a great lawyer.
Really smart guy, he' s like a borderline genius.
And I think I can get him to do it for free, a nominal fee, at most.
Okay, who?
Me, Perc.
I' m talking about me.
Roger, this isn' t a joke, okay?
This is my life.
I need a real lawyer, not a high- school Law teacher.
I passed the Bar in '96.
So, technically, I' m licensed to practice law in the State of California.
I understand, Roger.
Technically, you can practice law, but you' re not a practicing lawyer.
No, I' m not, but I' il be better than a public defender.
What I lack in experience, you know I' il make up for with insight.
I know you, I know the school, and I know these girls.
Look at me, man, I' m your guy.
I don' t...
What' s the point?
Nobody' s going to believe me.
I' m never gonna beat this.
What kind of attitude is that?
I already have a foolproof strategy.
I saw this in a movie once, all right?
Then, at a crucial point in the trial, I throw a jar at you... and you catch it with your other hand, thus proving your innocence.
You are an idiot.
Which arm do we say is dead?
- Well, which hand did you grope them with?
- Roger.
Roger, let me make something clear to you, all right?
I didn' t touch these girls.
Never.
Not one of them.
Let me make something clear to you, okay?
If I' m gonna be your lawyer, I don' t wanna know if you did it.
I don' t care.
It' s irrelevant.
- Okay, but...
- No, listen to me.
I don' t want to know.
Got it?
{y: i} Now I' m running my fingers {y: i} along your chest.
{y: i} And my red nails {y: i} are ripping through your chest hair... {y: i} like fire through a forest.
What am I doing to you?
I' ve got my thumb so far up your ass, I' m bowling with your ass.
- Okay?
I' m...
- Hank!
Yeah!
Okay, so that Evers report, I think, is due on Monday, is it not?
- Yeah...
- Hank, have you seen Bobo?
That stupid dog pissed all over my Manolos.
Fuck Bobo, okay?
Yeah, okay, and the nips?
That shipment is coming in...
That' s tomorrow, I think.
Talking to Moishe.
Yeah.
{y: i} Shalom.
Yeah, I' il see you at the {y: i} mezuzah, okay?
Fucking Hebs, you know, I got...
What, you can' t see that I' m working here?
Hello?
Never mind.
Bobo!
Fucking dog!
Run, Bobo, run.
Still there?
Fuck, are you kidding?
I got teak.
Knock, knock.
You okay, Daddy?
Yeah.
Kimberly, you' re a smart girl.
So before you decided to do this thing that you' re doing... gee, I hope you thought long and hard about it.
I hope you thought about what it' s going to mean for Daddy.
What are you saying?
Well, you know, Daddy' s name isn' t just his name.
It' s also a brand name... and people associate brand names with certain qualities.
For instance, when people hear the name Walt Disney... they think, "family friendly"... even though Disney gives benefits to faggots.
And when they hear the name Henry Joyce, do you know what they think of?
- What?
- "Quality electronics at the lowest prices."
And I want it to stay that way, Kimberly.
I don' t want them thinking, "Slutty daughter, who takes it in the ass."
So if it turns out that you were... somehow making all this up...
- How can you say that?
- No, I' m not saying anything.
It' s just, you know how people always want to blame the parents... and it just drives me fucking crazy.
Daddy, I would never do anything to hurt you or your reputation.
Yay, Kimberly.
Good, good.
That' s...
Kimberly?
Kimberly.
Would you please take your dog for a walk?
- Enough of that already.
What?
I saw her.
Her red nails were running through his chest hair like fire through a forest.
That' s actually kind of poetic.
Okay.
I' ve said what I' ve had to say here.
I just do wish you would' ve told me before you went and started this thing because...
I' m sure it will be fine, because these things never go to trial.
And so day one of the Roxbury sexual assault trial is set to begin.
Stay tuned to {y: i} Team 33 News for more updates, throughout the day.
I' m Emily Klein.
Okay, cut.
- This is huge.
- Fucking huge.
Can you believe this all started out as a wimpy little special- interest feature?
They give me fluff, and I turn it into dirt.
- You know what that is?
- It' s hot.
It' s fucking hot.
No, it' s talent.
Here, wait here.
Kimberly.
Hi.
Off the record...
I just want to say that I really admire your courage.
Thank you, Emily.
I' m doing this because I feel like I have a responsibility.
Not just to myself but to all the other girls all around the world...
- who have been subjected to harassment.
- Yes.
Or, God forbid, outright assault at the hands of teachers... and who are too scared or ashamed to come forth.
I' m fighting a battle inside these walls, Emily... but I' m also fighting a war.
You have such passion and conviction.
You kind of remind me of myself when I was your age.
I only wish I' d had half your self- assurance.
Thank you, Emily.
And, off the record...
I could never give up men.
I like cock too much.
But sometimes I just need a womars touch.
Hi.
I have no further questions, Your Honor.
Mr. Nicholl, you may cross- examine.
After you.
Your Honor.
Well, well, well.
That' s quite a story you' ve spun for us, Miss Joyce.
Very detailed, and might I say, very graphic.
But let me ask you something, is any of it true?
Or is it all just a malicious fabrication... designed to discredit and humiliate the man... that replaced you as the lead in the school play?
I wouldn' t perjure myself, Mr. Nicholl, not for any reason.
I' m sure you wouldn' t, Kimberly.
But tell me, why do you think you were fired from the role of Anne Frank?
I suppose it was because of something I said in the cafeteria... during the International Food Fair... which I organized to raise money for the Drama Club, as well as... foster a spirit of togetherness among the multicultural community at Roxbury.
Would you care to recount this incident to the court?
Certainly.
It was during lunch hour, back in September.
The Food Fair was on... and you and Mr. Anderson were supervising... so you had to eat lunch with the students.
{y: i} You were sitting at a table in the corner... {y: i} and Brittany and I could see you {y: i} from our table, where we sat... {y: i} - eating granola and low- fat yogurt.
{y: i} - Could you hear what we were saying?
{y: i} No, but you sure looked at us a lot.
That Kimberly Joyce.
What about her?
She' s a very good student.
She' s very bright.
You sure about that?
Yeah, she' s a fantastic actress, as well.
Let me tell you something about Kimberly Joyce.
Last year, her freshman year, she took a standard IQ test... obliterated all school records.
Nobody believed it.
They figured she was cheating, so they made her take it again.
She scored even higher.
Made her take it a third time.
Guess what happened on the third time?
Her test broke the computer.
- It broke...
She scored that high?
- No, she didn' t.
She penciled in those little circles to spell "fuck you."
- Does that break the computer?
- My point is this:
You have brains like that, you have the face of an angel... throw in a ripe little pubescent body bursting out of that uniform... - that spells trouble.
- Okay.
The devil wears a gray skirt, my friend, and her name is Kimberly Joyce.
Earlier this week, in detention...
I could have sworn she was coming on to me.
Of course she was coming on to you.
Do you want to know why she was coming on to you?
'Cause she knows you can' t do anything about it, that' s why.
And forget English, Math, Science.
For them, high school is all cock- teasing 101.
And I got news for you.
Those two are on the honor role.
I mean, look at them.
Look at them over there.
Whispering.
Giggling.
You know exactly what they' re saying, too.
Brittany, God, Mr. Nicholl is so sexy.
I mean, he' s got such a cute ass.
You know, one time I saw Mr. Nicholl when he thought I wasn' t looking.
He picked a booger out of his nose, and then he ate it.
You know what, Perc?
Any moment now, they' re going to walk by... and they' re going to bat their eyelashes, and they' re going to wave.
Just the fingers, not the hand.
Not today.
Because it ends right now.
We' re going to give them the barest of acknowledgment.
A simple head nod, if they' re lucky.
Tonight, they' re going to lie in bed, wide awake... and they' re going to wonder why.
They' re going to wonder, "Where has my power gone?"
- Hi, Mr. Anderson.
- Hi, Mr. Nicholl.
- Hi, girls.
- Hi, girls.
God damn it.
Show me, where is it?
Come on.
What, do you not speak English?
Come on, show me.
Where is it?
What?
Just show me where Palestine is?
What' s going on?
Randa, are you okay?
Okay?
Where is it?
I mean, where is it?
She can' t show me.
'Cause there never has been, and there never will be any country called Palestine.
Josh Horowitz, I think it' s really low of you... to bring divisive politics into this Food Fair... when the purpose of it was to foster a spirit of togetherness... among Roxbury' s international community... as well as to raise money for the Drama Club.
Yeah?
Well, forgive me, but you were kind of tempting fate... by putting Israel next to Palestine.
I mean, what kind of fucking diplomacy is that?
God help us if you ever become UN Leader.
It' d be like World War ill.
I don' t want to become UN Leader, I want to become an actress, so there.
Yeah, well, I' m sure you' il be a good one, because right now you' re acting like a bitch.
What are you laughing at, Sudan?
And, Josh, at least my dad isn' t a money- grubbing Jew shyster... who lets criminals go free.
Oops.
Rewind.
- It seems like you run a tight ship here.
- Yes, a very tight ship.
The parents pay handsomely.
They should expect nothing less.
Can you tell us, say, about a typical complaint you might field from a parent?
Complaints are few and far between at Roxbury.
I' m sorry, but we' re going to have to end this conversation today.
If there' s anything you need, don' t hesitate to ask.
I like your suit.
- Thanks again.
Lesbian bitch!
I know exactly what' s going on here.
They gave her a puff piece... she resents it, and she' s digging for dirt.
God knows, she' il find it around here.
Charles, you wanted to see me about something?
I want you to replace Kimberly Joyce in the play.
Find a new lead.
I can' t do that.
She' s the best actress in the school.
We go up in two weeks.
Well, I' m sorry... but we can' t have our Anne Frank running around... making anti- Semitic remarks.
That' s a level of irony...
I just don' t want to have happening under this roof.
I' m sure she didn' t mean anything by it, Charles.
They' re just kids, after all.
Percy, replace her.
Now is not the time to court controversy.
- Very well.
- And another thing... be extra careful to behave yourself.
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.
We will not tolerate racial slurs at Roxbury.
Now, you can use them at any other time... at home, at the mall, at rock - 'r- roll concerts... but when you' re under my roof you will respect the heritage... of every student and faculty member.
Do I make myself clear?
Yes, sir.
The ironic thing is my dad isn' t even tight with money.
I mean, he owns three sports cars, and he just bought me... this rare, expensive kind of dog that only eats tuna fish.
Okay, Josh, you' ve had your say.
Kimberly, is there anything that you' d like to tell Mr. Horowitz?
I don' t know what came over me.
My dad is something of a racist, and I tend to pick things up at home.
Always starts with the parents, doesn' t it?
But still, I do think that you owe Mr. Horowitz an apology.
I' m sorry about what I said about your dad.
It' s okay.
You were partly right.
My dad does let criminals go free.
He' s really good at it.
{y: i} - Potato latke?
- Too fattening.
They' re yummy.
Okay.
Well, I' m glad we could smooth that over.
Why don' t you two just hurry on back to class now?
I' m sorry, Kimberly, my hands are tied on this one.
No, Mr. Anderson, you can' t do this.
- Playing Anne Frank means so much to me!
- I know.
You know, right before my brother Sean left for "Operation Iraqi Freedom"... he gave me a present.
Do you know what it was?
- No.
{y: i} - The Diary of Anne Frank.
Come on, do you really expect me to believe that?
I' m not going to forget this.
You' re being really cool about this, Kimberly.
I thought you might be mad.
Don' t be silly.
I wouldn' t let a play ruin our friendship.
I' m glad.
{y: i} Then I helped Brittany dye her hair... because, as you know, Anne Frank wasn' t a blonde.
Yes, I do know that, but thank you.
Let me ask you something, Kimberly.
Didn' t it make you angry... when Mr. Anderson told you he was replacing you with Brittany Wells?
I don' t know.
You don' t know?
Look at that, she doesn' t know.
Well, thank God I know.
Didm' t you want to get back at him?
- No.
- No?
Miss Joyce, isn' t it possible that you are infatuated with Mr. Anderson?
Isn' t it possible that you were trying to seduce him?
And that you thought that the play might even bring you closer to him?
No.
Hold that thought.
Ladies and gentlemen, I now present to you, Exhibit A.
Your Honor.
An essay, written by you, Miss Joyce, during detention with Mr. Anderson... as punishment for talking during his class.
An essay that you read out loud, as per his request.
Isn' t this correct, Miss Joyce?
- Yes, that' s correct.
- Yes.
That' s what I thought.
Do me a favor, would you?
Read that out loud to the court.
Okay, but I' m kind of embarrassed.
Embarrassed?
Well, well, well.
Why are you embarrassed, Kimberly?
I wanted to get it done quickly, and I didn' t do a very good job.
I mean, I just, you know, want to let the court know... that this essay does not necessarily reflect my writing abilities.
Nobody cares about your writing abilities, Kimberly.
Just read your essay, please.
Thank you.
"Why I deserve to be punished.
"I have misbehaved.
"Some adjectives that could be used to describe my behavior...
"include bad...
"naughty, mischievous, nasty..." and downright inconsiderate.
"I should know better than to talk in class.
"My mother always taught me not to talk too much...
"and when I did, she used to spank me.
"She' d spank me so hard that it hurt.
"In conclusion, I have learned my lesson...
"and I promise not to misbehave in the future.
"But if I do...
"I will gladly accept any punishment..." you choose to hand down. "
So, that' s it.
I' m done.
Can I go?
- Yeah.
- Goodie.
I' il take that.
That stays here.
That' s it, I' m done.
Can I go?
One moment, Your Honor.
- What the fuck was that supposed to prove?
I swear to God, it' s all in the delivery, Roger.
Miss Joyce, do me a favor, would you?
Would you read that again, please?
And this time I' d love for you to do it seductively.
All right?
Just try to make the words sexy.
You want me to act sexy for you, Mr. Nicholl?
- Mr. Nicholl?
- Some leeway, please, Your Honor.
Very well.
Miss Joyce, would you please try and do what he asks?
Please, I appreciate that.
Okay, look, I' m really trying, but I don' t know how to be sexy.
- I mean, I' m only 15!
- It' s okay, dear.
Mr. Nicholl, if you have no more questions, then court is adjourned... and we' il continue this tomorrow.
Are you all right, dear?
Bet you' ve never seen one like that before.
Silly boy, over 60% of guys are circumcised.
Right.
I like it.
It' s cute.
- It is?
- Yes, and you' re cute.
- I am?
- Yes.
- So did you ask him?
- No.
- Josh, you said you would.
- I know, I will.
I just...
It doesn' t make sense to me.
I don' t understand why.
It doesn' t have to make sense.
All that matters is that I want you to.
It would make me happy.
You want to make me happy, don' t you, Josh?
- Of course I do, you' re amazing.
- I know.
Miss Azzouni, now... you were also present at this detention in question, were you not?
Yes.
I finished writing my essay before Kimberly.
Mr. Anderson took me in the other room to discuss it.
I' m sorry?
Another room?
There is a small room beside Mr. Andersors classroom... {y: i} separated by glass.
Randa, I' m going to be honest with you.
This essay is unintelligible.
You just...
Well, you just can' t write competently in the English language.
Now, what are we going to do about that?
I' m going to let you in on a little secret.
It' s not fashionable to send your kids to a place like this anymore.
You want to be a good Hollywood liberal... you send your kids to a public school.
A safe public school, mind you... but one where they can mingle with the common people.
Meanwhile, this relic of an institution grows every year... more and more dependent on wealthy immigrants like yourself... from countries where elitism is still very much in... to the point where... there is a not- so- subtle pressure being exerted on people like me... to go easy on people like you.
Well, had you gotten virtually any other teacher at this school... they' d probably turn a blind eye to sentences like:
"I must not speaking in class."
Now, I know what you' re thinking right now.
You' re sitting there, loathing me right now, aren' t you?
Because good grades are very important to your parents.
They' re vitally important.
What are we going to do about that?
If your compositional skills don' t improve within the next year...
I will have no trouble failing you.
All right?
Do I make myself clear?
Look at me.
Now, I know that there' s a brain here, underneath this piece of cloth.
And when...
Now, here' s what we' re going to do.
And do you recall any of the details of this discussion?
- I do not recollect the details.
No.
- That' s okay.
Tell me, do you remember anything...
Mr. Anderson said to you during that discussion, anything at all?
Well, one thing I remember is that he told an off- color joke.
An off- color joke?
Mr. Anderson told you an off- color joke.
Could you repeat it for us, please?
- How?
And the rest of the duties are left to the flies.
And what happened next, Miss Azzouni?
Then he said:
"Now I' m going to touch you on your boobs."
Boobs?
I would never say boobs!
I' m an English teacher.
- Breasts, I would say breasts...
- Mr. Anderson, restrain yourself.
I have no further questions, Your Honor.
Very well, Mr. Nicholl, you may begin your cross- examination.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Yeah.
Good stuff.
Miss Azzouni, engage me here a little bit here, would you?
I' m just curious.
Which hand did Mr. Anderson allegedly fondle you with?
Both hands.
Both hands?
No more questions.
I' m nervous about testifying tomorrow.
I' m not very good under pressure.
Well, all you got to do is tell the truth, right?
Right.
So what' s there to be nervous about?
Kimberly and Randa, they already did a good job on the stand.
Especially Kimberly.
Man, she was amazing.
Look, I' m not Kimberly, okay?
This whole thing is really scary for me, with the Judge and all the lawyers.
I' m starting to think it was a bad idea.
No, hey.
Hey, hey.
What Mr. A did to you, to all of you, was wrong.
Right?
You' re right.
Baby?
Yeah?
Did it make you sad when Kimberly broke up with you?
You mean, when I broke up with her.
No, when she broke up with you, 'cause you weren' t ready to have sex.
What?
No way.
Is that what she told you?
What, that' s not the way it went?
No, it' s not even close.
What do you mean?
What happened?
Well, I heard something... that kind of freaked me out... and to be honest with you, it was kind of making me look bad.
{y: i} One night, I was over at Kimberly' s house... {y: i} and she came out of the bathroom {y: i} and started doing this nasty little dance.
Kimberly, stop it.
Kimberly.
What' s the matter, baby?
You don' t like what you see?
Warren Prescott told me what he did to you.
Are you going to believe everything that Warren says?
I believe this.
Okay.
Assuming that it' s true... why is that a problem?
If you' re good, I' il let you go where Warren went.
No, that is not cool, Kimberly.
I don' t take some loser' s sloppy seconds, all right?
And I don' t want to be with some dirty little whore.
What did you say to me?
You heard me.
Slut.
{y: i} So that was it, I walked out.
Wow.
She never told me that.
It doesn' t matter.
Everything happens for a reason.
I mean, even when I was with Kimberly, I always had a thing for you.
You know how I used to look at you.
I can' t help but think she knew that.
She' s probably just really embarrassed.
You' re right.
And she really is being pretty brave about this whole thing.
Actually, I think you should just follow her example.
You' re as brave as she is.
Like Kimberly Joyce and Randa Azzouni before you... you have outlined a disturbing pattern... of repeated sexual assault and harassment... on the part of the defendant, your teacher, Mr. Anderson.
Now I have to ask you, why did you take so long to come forward?
We were scared.
We were ashamed.
And what finally made you break your silence?
When he decided to do it in front of everybody.
"Decided to do it in front of everybody."
Could you repeat for us the incident that drove you over the edge?
It was at Drama Club, after school on a Friday.
Lee Strasberg, of the famed {y: i} Actors Studio... used to stress the importance of being able to perform... private moments on stage.
Now, acting is about opening yourself up.
It is about freeing yourself from shame, reticence, inibition.
It' s about laying yourself bare.
So, Brittany, I want you to show me... your private moment.
- Private moment?
- Yes, private moment.
Something that you would do only in complete privacy.
Something that no one else would ever see you do.
Now, I want you to take a moment.
Think about what that is.
Then, when you have it, show me.
I don' t want to do that.
Do you want to be Anne Frank?
Do you want to be our lead?
Yes, but I...
Stop whining and do it.
Well, what' s he doing here?
Roger, what are you...
Nobody' s here, Brittany.
That' s the point.
None of us are here.
You' re alone, by yourself...
Close your eyes.
All right?
Lmagine yourself in the privacy of your own room... the door is locked, it' s closed.
Windows are shut.
Curtains are drawn.
You' re all alone.
It' s just you.
You' re all alone.
It' s just you.
It' s just you.
I can' t do this.
- No way!
- Brittany!
Brittany!
That was very good.
You know, Anne Frank had nowhere to run.
So you can stay here and act like a professional... or are you going to run and cry, like a little girl?
I am a little girl, you fucking pervert!
Pervert.
I have no more questions, Your Honor.
Very well.
Court is adjourned till Monday.
- Hello?
- Kimberly, hi, it' s Barry.
{y: i} - Hi, Barry.
- I haven' t seen you lately.
I' ve actually been thinking.
How can I put this tactfully?
Barry, I never really liked you all that much... {y: i} and I think we should break up.
{y: i} Barry?
It always goes down easy.
{y: i} What?
That was one of the reasons why beer is better than a woman.
{y: i} If it' s flat, you can throw it out.
Okay, Barry...
You don' t have to wash it before it tastes good.
{y: i} I' ve really got to go, okay?
- It' s always wet... {y: i} - Barry!
Are you even listening to me?
Did you hear what I said?
{y: i} Is it another guy?
Yeah!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
I bet you' ve never seen one of those, before.
You silly girl, I have one.
Oh, right.
I like it, it' s cute.
- Is it?
- Yes, and you' re cute.
- I am?
- Yes.
- You' re amazing.
- I know.
Dad?
Busy?
- I' m always busy, Josh.
- Right.
I was wondering if I could ask you something.
Put that down, that' s a memento.
- What is it, Josh, what is it?
- Sorry.
I was wondering if you could help out Mr. Anderson.
It' s really tearing me up inside watching him go through this trial.
I mean, he' s such a good teacher.
I can' t even remember how many long sessions... that he spent with me after school, helping me... with my math homework.
I thought Mr. Anderson was an English and Drama teacher.
Yeah, but he' s really good at math, too.
Mr. Anderson couldn' t afford five minutes of my time.
I know that, Dad.
But I was hoping you could do it {y: i} pro boner.
{y: i} Pro bono, Josh, Latin.
And I don' t do {y: i} pro bono.
But he' s innocent, Dad, these girls are totally lying.
I got a lot more important cases on my desk... than some high- school tempest in a teapot.
I know that, Dad, but...
Look, you know how you' re always apologizing to me... about how your work leaves you so little time to spend with me... and watch me growing up, and so, instead, you' re always... buying me these rare, expensive kinds of dogs that only eat tuna fish?
Well, I think that if you did this favor for me, Dad... it' d go a long way towards making up for that.
Well, I' il consider it.
Hey.
With the surprise addition of Larry Horowitz to Percy Andersors defense team... the Roxbury sex trial has leapt off the local pages... and attained dramatic new proportions.
Today, the eyes of a nation, indeed, of other nations... will turn to this courthouse in Beverly Hills... where Larry Horowitz, will make his first court appearance.
If one emblematic figure, above all others, has emerged during this trial... it would have to be beautiful, young plaintiff, Kimberly Joyce.
As a woman, it' s difficult not to feel inspired... by her marching into court each day... her chin held high, her chest... her chest thrust forward.
like a latter day Joan of Arc, going off to fight in the Crusade.
Give me a fucking break.
Other beneficiaries of the intensified media attention include me.
You' re all so sweet.
Thank you all for your letters.
And now, to answer some of your questions.
Francine Whitmore of Anaheim asks:
Is this my natural hair color?
Well, Francine, a lady doesn' t reveal her beauty secrets.
And no, James Foster of Newport Beach, I' m technically not single.
But don' t give up hope... because you never know what might happen in the future.
Shit.
Cut!
Did you get that?
Nadine!
Mr. Horowitz, you may begin cross- examination.
So I' ve been thinking.
I' ve been thinking that maybe it' s about time we put a stop to him.
Let' s begin by talking about career aspirations.
Randa, as you know, Brittany and I want to be actresses.
So where do you see yourself in 10 years?
I would like to be a doctor, because I think it is a good thing to help society.
I would especially like to help the poor.
Okay.
Randa, that' s really sweet... but in America, doctors don' t help the poor.
And I hope you' re not implying that actresses don' t help society... because they often attend charity events... and, you know, appear in films that have important social messages.
- I' m sorry, I didn' t mean to...
- It' s okay.
I just hope that me and Brittany can persuade you to change your mind.
Being a doctor requires an awful lot of schooling... whereas the wonderful thing about being an actress is... you don' t have to study at all.
All it takes is talent, determination... and sleeping with some people who you otherwise wouldn' t.
- And the edge.
- Yes.
Brittany and I often talk about the edge.
See, unfortunately, we' re not the only aspiring actresses in this town.
It' s filled to the brim with competition, most of whom are equally talented... and equally as beautiful, and equally as promiscuous.
So you need something to separate yourself from the pack.
You need the edge.
This leads us to Mr. Anderson.
- It does?
- Yes.
Randa, what' s the greatest thing about this country?
Sylvester Stallone?
No.
The greatest thing about this country is freedom.
And one of those freedoms is that anybody can sue anybody... at any time, over anything.
And even if your case is completely unfounded and you lose... you can still tarnish someone' s reputation forever.
You want to sue Mr. Anderson?
The timing' s perfect.
That lesbian reporter' s roaming the hallowed halls of Roxbury.
What if something explosive happened... during what was supposed to be an innocuous little puff piece?
Something like sexual assault charges?
Do you suppose that the main players... might be subject to an enormous amount of media exposure?
Do you suppose that it might jump start their acting careers?
Okay, what' s the worst- case scenario?
We lose the case, we still get famous... and Mr. Anderson has to live with the stigma for the rest of his life.
The rest of his life?
Brittany, don' t pussy out on me.
Look, he' s failing Randa.
He canned me from the play.
We all know what he did to you.
You said you wanted to burn him.
And the way I see it, he' s already doused himself in gasoline.
All we have to do is strike a match.
Will Mr. Anderson be fired?
In all likelihood, yes.
- Then I am in.
- Bonus.
Would we have to, like, testify?
Probably not.
These things never go to trial.
'Cause you know I' m no good under pressure.
Mr. Horowitz, you may begin cross- examination.
Miss Wells...
Okay!
It' s all a lie, every word is a lie!
But it was Kimberly' s idea!
We were just mad at Mr. Anderson.
We wanted to get back at him!
Oops.
Rewind?
Cocktails.
You lying, backstabbing, two- faced little cunt!
Hi, Emily.
Do you have any idea what you' ve done?
Do you have any idea how many victims... how many real victims of sexual harassment... have just lost all credibility in the public eye?
How many are going to be afraid to come forward now?
How many are going to continue to suffer in silence... all because of this asinine little stunt you' ve pulled?
I don' t know, Emily.
How many?
I' m going to bury you.
I beg to differ.
While all the other little pundits with microphones... are going to be clamoring for my head on a stick... the most popular and influential reporter in town... is going to be marching to quite the different drum.
You are going to be my lone champion... my staunch defender, my dyke in shining armor.
And why would I want to do that?
Because if you don' t, I' il go right to your news director... and tell him exactly where his favorite little bloodhound... had been digging for milk bones.
I' d say that munching underage rug is way the hell up there.
Wouldn' t you?
Like he' s going to believe you.
Everyone knows you' re a liar now.
I have proof.
What did you do?
Did you videotape us?
Do you know I thought that you were like I was in high school?
But you' re not.
My God, you' re just another one of the mean ones... who called me names, who made my life miserable.
My God, you' re just another one of those.
Okay, Emily, listen carefully.
That is the sound of me not caring.
I gotta go.
- You used me.
- Ditto, sister.
Have you looked at yourself in the mirror lately?
My God.
You have brought shame upon this family.
So much shame, I cannot express.
In part, I blame this country.
Its influence.
Its moral decay.
Perhaps it was a mistake to come here.
But you should have enough strength to resist.
That' s how we raised you.
Look at me when I' m talking to you!
You should have more than enough strength!
Today is as if I have no daughter!
Get up!
{y: i} The disgraced students {y: i} arrived at school today... {y: i} after the end of classes {y: i} to collect their belongings.
{y: i} The three girls {y: i} have been suspended indefinitely... {y: i} while the school decides {y: i} on disciplinary action.
{y: i} The DA' s office revealed yesterday... {y: i} that all charges against Percy Anderson {y: i} have been dropped.
I can' t believe you lied.
- Troy...
- Don' t touch me!
I cannot believe you were up there in court... saying all those disgusting things about Mr. Anderson.
I can' t believe you made all that up.
What kind of person are you?
But the thing in Drama, that was true.
You were there.
My God, Brittany, he was trying to help you.
You just throw it back in his face.
Troy, please don' t be mad.
Mad?
I don' t want to look at you anymore.
You disgust me.
You know, I thought you were different, Brittany.
But you' re not.
We' re through.
Does it feel bad?
Like a hundred little cuts all over your body?
You wanna just crawl in the dirt and stay there... where no one can see, don' t you?
Look on the bright side, Brittany.
As an actress... whenever you need to feel pain... you can look back on this moment.
You can bottle it up and keep it forever.
Hurry up.
Whoa, you have any metal on you?
Jewelry, earrings, anything like that?
See, there you go.
Every day we go through this.
All right, you sure you got everything now?
Everything.
All right, go ahead.
Try it one more time.
Okay.
All right.
I' m going to have to ask you to remove your...
- Is there a problem here?
- This is part of our religion.
Yeah, I understand it' s religious, but the machine...
Sir, I don' t care about your machine.
She is here to get her books.
Okay, fine, go.
You two, stay.
Go.
- Just trying to doing my job, sir.
- I understand.
- All right.
- I know that.
Will you shut the fuck up?
Enough already!
Come on!
Fuck me!
Will you stop it!
Bobo, come here.
Where' s the fucking dog?
Hey!
Shit!
Bobo!
Hey!
Hello?
I' m trying to think in here.
I' m trying to do a little work in here!
Hello?
Does anybody think about me?
Enough already with the Ludwig- van- fucking- Mozart crap!
Can' t you hear me thinking there?
I got a job to do!
I' ve got work to do!
Stop it.
Stop!
Fuck me in the ass.
I' m trying to work!
Do you not pay attention to anything but yourself?
She shouldn' t have done that.
Who?
The diaper head.
Maybe somebody should have given just a little bit more thought... to the consequences of their action.
Have you any idea, this little charade you cooked up... how it' s made me look, huh?
- I' m sorry about your business, Daddy.
- Thank you.
I feel so much better.
But I bet you have a lot more free time now, right?
Free time?
She thinks I' m gonna spend the free time with her.
Can you fucking imagine?
little twat, like you!
You crazy?
You got a fuzzy little brain in your head, explain it to her.
Why would I want to do that?
You know, there was a time... when I actually thought I could protect you.
It just seems so long ago.
Well, fuck me, cocksuckers, I' m through with that now.
Okay?
It' s over.
You can do whatever you want.
I don' t care!
You want to join a rock band, fine.
Go ahead.
Become a hooker, get pregnant, do drugs, here.
Here' s a little something to get you started.
Come on, you are such a good little man, I' m going to treat your fuzzy little nose.
And you are just like your fucking mother, a cunt.
Come on.
I don' t even like this kind, you asshole!
Then shove them up your ass!
Bobo, come on with Daddy.
Come on, Bobo.
{y: i} I just think it' s horrible {y: i} what they put that poor man through.
{y: i} You have to wonder what kind of homes {y: i} these girls are coming from.
{y: i} I mean, what kind of parents could raise {y: i} such horrible little monsters?
{y: i} Who knows where she got the gun?
{y: i} I mean, accessibility to firearms... {y: i} is one of the main problems {y: i} facing the youth of society today.
{y: i} Hold on, I got a call.
{y: i} So you' il forgive me, loyal viewers, {y: i} if I don' t clap my hands... {y: i} and join in on another round {y: i} of "blame the victim."
{y: i} To my eyes, {y: i} Kimberly Joyce will always be innocent... {y: i} and more than that, she will be {y: i} an American heroine.
The blood...
Kimberly Joyce tried out for Marie- France, didn' t she?
- Yeah.
- And why didn' t we pick her again?
Didn' t stand out.
- Is it too late to re- cast that role?
- It' s never too late.
Lisa, I need you to find Kimberly Joyce.
Girlfriend.
Hey.
Kathy let me in.
I' m sorry I haven' t called in ages.
I' ve just been really busy.
Did I tell you I' m moving to my mom' s?
I was talking to Josh Horowitz.
Yeah?
He told me something.
I' ve been trying to wrap my head around what it means, but I can' t.
What did he tell you, Brit?
He said you asked him to ask his father to represent Mr. Anderson.
And if that' s true... the only thing it could possibly mean is that you wanted me to confess.
So I was trying to think, why?
But I couldn' t find an answer.
Well, maybe you should think a little harder.
Was all this really just to get famous?
To be on that stupid show?
Partly.
Because you' re the only one who got famous.
Kimberly, everyone' s already forgotten about me.
Don' t sweat it, hon.
Fame is overrated.
It' s so fleeting, you know?
Heartbreak, on the other hand...
Heartbreak lasts forever.
Oh, my God.
Troy?
You' re not his perfect little angel anymore, are you?
Oh, no.
Now, you' re a dirty little whore... just like me.
I' ve turned you into me.
You mean, all of this...
Everything was about a boy?
Not very original, granted.
But you know that green- eyed monster can be a real bitch.
You never wanted to be Anne Frank, did you?
Oh, yes, I did.
And then I wanted to get fired, establish a motive... make everybody think I had something against Mr. Anderson.
Then a little accidental racial slur... and everything fell into place.
I mean, my God, Brittany... it' s like the whole world is this orchestra, and I' m the conductor.
- I thought you were my friend.
- I was.
But you stole my boyfriend, Brittany.
But, Kimberly, Randa...
Randa died because of this!
Every war has its casualties.
Just ask my brother.
Oh, my God.
You' re a fucking psycho.
Some things I borrowed from you.
I never want to speak to you or see you again.
You psycho!
{y: i} Cody, you are almost as funny {y: i} as Jerry Lewis.
{y: i} Really?
{y: i} That' s sweet, man.
{y: i} I feel like I' m going to cry more {y: i} than my mom at the end of Beaches.
{y: i} Just like shooting the ducks in a carnival, {y: i} you know?
{y: i} They go by in a line, one at a time... {y: i} and you' ve got your little rifle.
{y: i} Bam!
Bam!
Bam!
Surely, you must have something to say?
{y: i} My family came here for American dream.
{y: i} We only found nightmare.
{y: i} - What do you have to say?
{y: i} - You killed Kenny.
You bastard!
{y: i} Well, I guess you can light {y: i} a fart on fire, huh?
{y: i} But I have nothing for you.
{y: i} It' s cool, don' t worry about it.
Wait a moment, maybe I do.

Kids, in life there are a lot of big romantic moments.
And they make life worth living.
But here' s the problem: moments pass, and lurking just around the corner from those moments is a cruel, unshaven bastard named reality.
And so, back in 2006, on the night of Claudia and Stuart' s wedding, reality was the enemy.
Wow.
The Peace Corps?
Yeah.
I ship out tomorrow -- two years.
You know, some people say the Peace Corps is the most noble thing a person can do.
To those people, I say, "Is it?"
And usually they say, "Yes, it is."
Barney, they are so right.
I wish there was something I could do.
Oh, Tanya...
I' m so glad you said that.
This wasn' t how I' d thought the night would turn out.
This was finally supposed to be my big moment with Robin.
But then reality came along.
Robin got called up last- minute to anchor the 11: 00 news.
It was her big break.
And I went to the wedding stag.
Then, when I least expected it...
Hey, where the hell did you disappear to last night?
I had the most amazing night ever.
Tell me about it.
That cake.
Best cake I ever had.
Seriously.
My stomach was, like,
"Hey, bro, I don' t know what you' re eating, 'cause I don' t have any eyes, but it' s basically awesome, so keep sending it down Gullet Alley."
Yeah, I know.
My stomach was, like, "Girlfriend, we don' t always get along, but that cake..."
Lily.
"Most amazing night ever," and go.
You know, I should tell you, I have a rule.
I never hook up at weddings.
I' m guessing you haven' t always had this rule.
Well, here' s the thing, those big romantic moments, they' re great when they happen, but they' re not real.
Exactly, exactly -- like- like just now, when I saw you doing the chicken dance out there,
I' m not gonna lie to you, big- time thunderbolt.
Mm.
You should see me tap dance.
You' d be down on bended knee.
Sadly not out of character.
But I know now it' s just a mirage.
Wedding goggles.
Exactly.
And that, in a nutshell, is why I' m not putting the moves on you.
This isn' t the moves?
What, you... you think this is the moves?
Believe me, you' d know the moves.
People ten tables away would know the moves.
Oh, that' s too bad.
Tell me about it.
I have a solution.
Interested.
And to preface this, we' re not gonna sleep together tonight.
Less interested.
Go ahead.
Okay.
So the thing that always screws it up is the next day.
So...
Why don' t we just cut that part out?
What are you saying?
I' m saying, I' m here, you' re here, this is a big romantic wedding -- why don' t we just dance and have a great time, and then when it' s over, never see each other again.
- Unless...
No unless.
No e- mails, no phone numbers, not even names.
Tonight we will make a memory that will never be tarnished.
And then... when we' re old and gray, we' il look back on this night and it' il be perfect.
Wow.
- Okay, I' m in.
- Okay.
I guess, uh, what, we' il need fake names?
Um... you can call me Buttercup.
Pleased to meet you, Buttercup.
I' m...
Lando Calrissian.
Wow, this is kind of exciting.
Our names will forever be shrouded...
Ted, Ted, Ted.
Look, I got a bridesmaid.
Ted, look, look, Ted, the second hottest bridesmaid.
Ted, look.
See ya, Ted.
So, I' m Ted.
Victoria.
- But no last names.
- No last names.
Oh, what is wrong with you?
Dude, that is just, like... a weenie- ass idea.
No, it was awesome -- I had a great night,
I' m never gonna see her again, and there' s no way to ruin it.
Ted, how do I explain this to you?
Last night I ate the best cake of my life.
Now, you think I' m gonna let that cake out of my life?
Hell, no.
I' m gonna find out what bakery made that cake, and then I' m gonna get some more cake.
That cake really got to you, huh?
It haunts me.
So, what happened next?
Okay.
Ground rules have been established.
Now let' s see some of these moves I' ve heard so much about.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Let' s do all the single ladies in this joint a big favor and steal the bouquet.
Yes, but we' il need... a diversion.
- Kiss!
- Kiss!
Kiss!
Kiss!
Kiss!
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
So that' s what happened to the bouquet.
You know, good for Victoria.
It' s such an evil tradition.
You' re not gonna do it at your wedding?
Hell, yeah, I' m gonna take that flower- grenade and chuck it into the crowd and scream, "Crawl for it, bitches!"
That' s just what girls do.
So, where' d you guys go?
Very nice.
Yeah?
Okay, I don' t really know how to tap dance.
I couldn' t tell.
Really.
Well, it' s too bad you' re not gonna get some tonight.
Oh, if I wanted some, I could get some.
No, you couldn' t.
You' re a dude.
- I could get some.
- You could totally get some.
We' re not gonna kiss tonight.
If- if we kiss, all of this becomes real.
You- you might use too much tongue.
I might not use enough.
And then suddenly, poof, spell' s broken.
I will use exactly the right amount of tongue.
Okay, how about this?
The best part of any first kiss is the lead- up to it.
The moment right before the lips touch.
It' s like a big drumroll.
So... how about tonight, we just stick with the drumroll?
Okay.
But we can' t kiss.
Okay.
A drumroll?
That' s it?
So, what, you just... you said good night, came home and... performed a drum solo?
Oh, Ted, you' re such a doof!
I mean, this girl sounds amazing.
She was completely amazing.
She was amazing and funny, and we connected on every level, and I' m never gonna see her again.
Damn it, I have to see her again!
- Yes!
- Yes!
So let' s get to work, man.
What else do you know about her?
Nothing.
Her name' s Victoria -- that' s all I got.
Wait, Claudia, Claudia would know.
Well, Claudia' s on her honeymoon.
She' il be back in two weeks -- call her then.
Yes, two weeks.
Good idea.
I' m calling her now.
No, Ted, you don' t mess with a honeymoon.
Yeah, come on, dude.
Ask her about the cake.
Ted?
Hey, Claudia!
Great wedding, beautiful toast, touching stuff.
How' s the honeymoon?
Listen, I' m calling because last night I met this girl, and I was wondering if you had...
Oh, you have got to be freaking kidding me!
Aw, here we go.
24 hours ago, you were begging... begging me to bring some other girl to my wedding, and now, well, uh, you' re over her?
I' ve moved on?
What was her name?
Is it my fat cousin Lindsay?
Don' t be embarrassed -- she has pretty eyes.
Uh, no.
Her name was Victoria.
I don' t know her last name.
Well, lucky for you, I know that guest list backwards and forwards.
Thank God.
Unlucky for you, there was no Victoria at my wedding.
Good- bye, Ted.
There was no Victoria at the wedding.
Maybe she used a second fake name.
Oh, she' s good, she' s very good.
Maybe she was ghost.
That' s why she didn' t want to kiss you -- because you' d just pass right through her and feel really cold for a second.
Oh, my God, I just had a great idea for a screenplay.
Marshall... she was not a ghost!
I know that she wasn' t a ghost.
She picked up a bouquet, proving she had corporeal form.
Wait- wait!
She was sitting across from a couple of bridesmaids.
She must' ve been at their table.
Maybe they know who she was.
Great.
So how do we get in touch with the bridesmaids?
This better be good -- I am about to enter Nirvana.
By the way, I should get you Nirvana' s phone number.
She gives a great massage.
Say what?!
- Barney!
- Ow!
I know the house rules.
Es un chiste!
Listen, Barney, I saw you talking to that bridesmaid last night.
Did you happen to get her phone number?
You know I did.
Great!
Um, I' m gonna need you to call her for me.
You know I won' t.
Why not?
Because we just hooked up last night.
I can' t call the girl the next day.
I have to wait at least, like... forever.
Oh, snap!
Never gonna call her.
Besides, she thinks I' m on my way to India.
Oh, come on, Barney, it' s for a good cause.
Uh, Ted going all castrati over yet another girl is exactly not a good cause.
Sorry, buddy, I wish I could help you -- my hands are tied.
Oh, no, wait -- that was last night.
Okay, Barney, I' il tell you what I' m going to do.
You make this call and I will go with you... to Foxy Boxing.
- Really?
- Yeah.
But you always said the Foxy Boxing girls were neither foxy not good at boxing.
I' m ready to be proven wrong.
- Tonight?
- Tonight.
Dial.
Yeah, Tanya, turns out I don' t leave for the Peace Corps till tomorrow.
It sucks.
Just one fewer day I get to help people.
Anyway, this girl -- any idea who she was?
Hold on.
What kind of shoes was sh...
No, Tanya, he' s a dude.
He' s not going to know what kind of shoes she was wearing.
Actually...
Oh, come on.
Hey!
So what do you want to do next?
Don' t think.
First thing that comes into your mind.
Hold... this... and this...
Whoa!
There she goes.
Apparently she was wearing brown shoes...... with little snowflakes on them.
Yeah, they do sound cute.
Any idea who...?
Okay.
Well, thanks anyway.
Yeah, you take ca...
What' s...?
Tonight?
Well, I' m shipping out pretty early, so I won' t be able to stay over, but, yeah, sure, I' d love to.
Okay.
I' il talk to you later.
Sorry, Ted, I won' t be able to make Foxy Boxing tonight.
I understand.
Okay, uh, let' s not lose hope.
We' il call the hotel.
Maybe she was staying there.
Or Ictor.
She probably doesn' t go by "Ictor."
No, you know what?
This is fate.
I am never supposed to see this girl again.
That was the whole point of the night.
I have just been saved from myself.
Let' s drink many beers.
Agreed.
And I thought that was the end of it.
But then...
Hey!
There' s the anchor lady!
How was it?
Oh, I don' t know.
Why don' t you ask the new substitute weekend anchor?
Robin?
Thanks, Robin!
It was awesome.
Back to you, Robin.
Congrats!
That' s so cool!
Yeah, I felt really bad bailing on Ted, though.
Oh, don' t even worry about it.
In fact...
And then Lily told her the whole story, right down to the brown shoes with the little snowflakes on them.
And by the end of it...
What?
I know who she is.
You know who she is?
But you weren' t even at the wedding.
Actually, I kind of... was.
What?
I decided to surprise Ted by going to the reception.
Oh, damn it!
Oh, stop it!
What the hell!
Hello?
You okay in there?
Um...
Just allergies or something.
I' m fine.
Listen, do you... want to come and cry out here?
I' ve been told I' m an excellent hugger.
Oh, thanks.
But I don' t actually cry in front of people or... cry at all, for that matter.
Oh, man, it' s gross.
Does everyone snot up this much when they cry?
Hey, you' re speaking to a fellow snotter.
So, why are you crying?
Because you have feelings for Ted.
I don' t know.
Maybe?
Okay, what is wrong with the two of you!
Seriously!
He likes you and you like him.
And j- j- just be together!
Cheese Louise!
Happiness is not that difficult!
Look, okay, yes.
I cried in the bathroom and that... was weird.
But that doesn' t mean I' m in love with the guy.
The fact is, I- I don' t know how I feel.
Yes, you do!
Seeing him with someone else and crying about it?
Guess what?
That' s how you feel.
That is nothing but how you feel.
Okay, fine.
I have feelings for him.
Happy?
Kinda, yeah.
But it doesn' t change anything.
I still don' t want to get married and he' s still...
Ted.
What I should do is just tell him who Victoria is so he can be happy.
Or you could tell him that you' re into him and then you could both be happy.
I' m going to go find him.
Well, wait.
Which one are you going to tell him?
I have no idea.
And here' s the most amazing part --
Because I told her I' d converted all my money to India dollars, she gave me 50 bucks to take a cab to the airport.
That' s right.
I just got paid for sex.
I really should give this money to the Peace Corps.
They' ve done so much for me lately.
Hi, guys.
Hey.
Um, Ted, can I talk to you outside for a second?
Yeah, sure.
What' s up?
I, uh, I have to tell you something.
Oh...
Oh, just get it.
Hello?
Ted?
It' s Stuart.
My lovely bride would like to say something to you.
Ted...
I' m sorry I hung up on you earlier.
My new husband, and the vodka cranberry, which cost $10. 50 at the freakin 'airport bar...
When is this plane going to board?!
Sweet pea?
... have helped me realize that sometimes I can act like a crazy person, and I don' t want my new husband to think I' m a crazy person.
It' s fine, Claudia, don' t worry about it.
Oh, um, Marshall wanted to know where you guys got that cake.
The cake?
Why don' t you take this?
Sounds like you could use it.
Thanks.
You' re very sweet.
So are you a friend of the bride or groom?
We got it at this little bakery downtown.
Actually neither.
It' s called the Buttercup Bakery.
Pleased to meet you, Buttercup.
I made the cake.
She made the cake.
She wasn' t on the guest list because she wasn' t a guest.
She made the cake.
She made that cake?
Ted, this is the girl.
You got to marry her.
Today.
She has to move in with us.
I' m going down to that bakery.
No, no.
Don' t do it.
Baby, what are you talking about?!
Yeah, all day long you been busting my apple- bag about finding this girl.
Well, I- I just think that... that maybe she' s not that into you.
And- and that' s why she didn' t give you her number.
Robin?
Care to chime in with anything?
Yes.
Ted...
Go get her.
Going.
Getting.
Ted, oh, my, gosh, I love this moment.
You know why?
'Cause I' m going to say it, and this time, you' re actually going to say yes.
You ready?
You ready to say yes?
Ted, suit up.
Yes!
No.
Oh, come on!
Whoa.
Guess we were gone a while.
Oh, that' s too bad.
I was looking forward to one last dance.
Well, yes, I am.
Sorry, I could tell what you were just thinking.
Wow, what was I just thinking?
"Damn, he' s looking mighty fine in that tux."
- You got me.
You are good.
- Yeah.
Mmm.
You know, I don' t look like this every day.
On a real weekend, the real Ted wears a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt with bleach stains on it.
Mmm.
The real Ted sounds real sexy.
Too bad I' il never get to see it.
Buttercup Bakery.
This is it.
Good luck, dude.
Grab me a cupcake.
Ted?
You still with us?
Tell me your last name.
You know there' s one little flaw in our plan.
What' s that?
I' m going to go home tonight with a lot of great memories and one really sucky memory.
The memory of you walking out that door.
Hey, Ted.
Yeah?
Close your eyes... and count to five.
One... two... three... four... five.
And to our dying days we' il remember everything about that night as perfect.
Maybe we both need that.
I mean, so many things go wrong in life but this is the one thing that never will.
It will always... always be pure unadulterated awesome.
And if I walk in there, I' m robbing both of us...
The meter' s running, dude.
Crap or get off the pot.
Yeah, yeah, I' m going.
Oh, thank God.

(Phil) I was born a baby.
A blank slate.
Thinking I was in control of my own destiny.
And then I met my father.
(Buck) You better be good at this stuff.
(Phil) In college, I wasn' t the most gifted athlete.
Oh.
Look out!
[groans]
How far was that?
Foot and three inches.
Runners take your mark.
Get set!
Hold on!
[grunts]
Oh, that hurts!
No, no, no, no.
Your day' s over, Phil.
Oh.
Are you all right?
Sorry about that.
Yeah, it' s no prob.
There' s a horrible wind.
Uh, no, there isn' t.
There is o- over there.
You know our love was meant to be
Hey, Dad!
(Buck) Hey, Son.
[Janice giggles]
Yeah.
(Buck) Nice to meet you, Barbara.
What you talking about?
You' re getting married?
Look, Phil, I' m lonely.
I' m a man.
Um, tomatoes, tomatoes.
Baby.
There he is, your grandson, Sam.
Oh, by the way, he had a son on the same day.
Take a gander at your brother, Bucky.
Just a little bit bigger.
[Run Around by Blues Traveler playing]
Welcome to my life.
When all it does is slow me down
Excuse me.
Hey, y- you didn' t need to take up two spots.
Look at the size of this bad boy, huh?
This is cute though, huh?
Go hemp!
[sighing]
[children yelling]
Okay.
Keep it simple.
Hey, honey.
Where' ve you been?
Oh, l- l- I' m sorry.
I got caught at work and then I had to park in the far parking lot.
Let' s go, Gladiators!
Hey, where' s Sam?
(Buck) Okay, Bucky, let' s go!
You' re kidding me.
(boy) Come on, Bucky!
Yay, Bucky!
Okay, Bucky.
Attaboy, Bucky!
Hey, big guy, how' d it go?
It went great.
We' il see you back at the house, Dad.
You played great.
Hey, look who' s here.
Two of my favorite people, and Phil.
Hey, Buck.
(Buck) That' s my ball.
Don' t -- Don' t get any ideas.
Don' t even touch it.
(male announcer) And now...
Hi, I' m Buck Weston, King of Sporting Goods.
Basketballs, footballs, hockey pucks, baseballs...
Those acting lessons really paid off.
You sure you don' t want a job?
I got a job, Dad.
Oh, yeah, what?
Selling -- Selling vitamins?
ln fact, you need to take more vitamins.
I take a vitamin every day, it' s called a steak.
Now look, I came up with this myself, look at this.
I' m Buck Weston.
(all) And he' s got balls!
What do you think?
Gripping.
Here we go again.
Will you knock it off?
Hey, knock it off, would you?
Hey, do that later, would you, please?
Look, we' re trying to have a nice family gathering, all right?
I' m trying to get my yard cleaned.
Let me -- Let me ask you.
The world' s gotta stop 'cause you got a family gathering?
Yeah, but you put all your --
Hey, stay out of this.
It' s between us, okay?
Hey!
It' s all for you!
How do you like that, Ditka?
[humming]
We' il settle this later, okay?
Yeah, exactly.
I got this for you, too!
Get out of here!
Phil, come on.
What are you lookin 'at?
He hit me with the ball.
Hey, Dad, what happened to all your fish?
That one ate the others.
I call him "Killer."
Killer?
I like it.
You might wanna clean the water every now and then.
Let' s see what you can do.
Hey, Dad, I didn' t know if...
I wanted to talk to you about Sam.
Yeah.
He hasn' t been playing much lately and, I didn' t know if --
And I got some great news.
He' s gonna get a lot more playing time now.
Dad, thanks, that' s -- that' s exactly what I wanted to hear.
I traded him to the Tigers.
(Buck) Ooh, hey!
You traded your own grandson?
Well, I didn' t actually get anything for him.
You know that cost $400?
I can' t believe it.
W- What, you calling me a liar?
I' il show you the receipt.
W- Why didn' t you just play him more?
He is going to play more, Philly --
Yeah, for another team!
Okay, yeah.
Sure.
But, you know, I want Sam to have fun.
This isn' t the big leagues.
For those who live between Broadway and Grandville, between the ages of 10 and 1 2, who are free on Sundays and Tuesdays, this is the big leagues.
But what about Sam?
Sam, you saw him out there today.
Oh!
Killer!
How did that happen?
Hey, Sam, you wanna give us a minute?
Uh- huh.
Of all the asinine things my dad has done, this is by far the most asinine.
But this beats them all.
I' m -- I' m spitting angry!
I' m like a tornado of anger, swirling about!
My heart rate is dangerously high right now.
What?
Yeah.
What do you mean?
Are you a robot?
Are you a robot- woman?
l -- I am not a robot.
and have some fun.
Okay, look, you' re too upset about this.
So, I' il tell him, okay?
No, no, no, no, no, no, I...
[sighs]
Benchwarmer?
[hissing]
[knocking on door]
Sammy?
Hey.
What are you doing?
No.
Just kidding.
(Phil) Look, uh, I got some good news.
I got you put on a new team.
I' m not on the Gladiators anymore?
You' re on the Tigers.
The Tigers?
Yeah.
They' re in last place.
Yeah, but you' re gonna get more playing time.
Did Grandpa trade me?
No.
This is a good thing.
Trust me.
You do not wanna be the kid that' s on the other end of the bench.
'Cause I know that kid.
Okay.
[panting]
I know.
That kid lives right here in this house!
Mom!
Mom!
He doesn' t --
Phew.
Okay?
Coach Benson will be good for you.
He knows his stuff.
Hey, the Tigers may be in last place, but those guys look pretty good.
Dad, those aren' t the Tigers.
They' re not even wearing blue.
I' m having a baby.
No, no, don' t hit my precious baby.
Cut it out!
Hi, excuse me.
Uh, Coach Benson around?
Yeah, you all know Phil Weston?
(John) Oh, yeah.
Hey, welcome to the team, little fellow.
Yeah, go ahead.
Did you hear?
How could he crack?
We' re only one game into the season.
All right, Tigers, it' s game time.
Oh, but we' re waiting for our coach.
Well, then one of you will have to coach.
Yeah, but I had talked to Coach Benson, we' re brand new --
All right.
Find yourself a coach, or the Tigers forfeit.
Where do I know you from?
No, that ain' t it.
I' il figure it out.
So, who' s gonna coach?
We got Mark into soccer, 'cause we wanted to take a break.
I didn' t think I' d be coaching the little bugger.
I' m looking for a job so it' s hard enough to drag myself out of bed.
So, uh, we forfeit.
No, no, no, no.
Uh, you know what, l -- I can coach.
Well, that' s swell!
Who are we playing?
How about you use your eyes?
Oh, great.
Everybody up.
Let' s go, come on.
Lift them.
Hey, hey, hey.
Where' s Benson?
(referee) How you doing, Buck?
Players take the field.
Good luck, Buck.
Yeah, good luck.
May the best man win?
Hey, let' s go, everybody.
Let' s go, guys.
Okay, Tigers, uh, why don' t we have starters take the field?
We don' t have starters, we never got that far.
Yes.
Me?
You, Sam, you, you, you, and you.
You guys, hit the field.
I' m sorry, did you say something?
We' re gonna get killed.
Oh, you don' t know that for sure.
And it' s gonna be awful.
(man # 1) Defense!
That was fast.
See you at the barbecue.
Come on!
When you find it you get to say it loud
Gotta code three [grunts]
Great, great, great.
You wanna go in?
I' m fine.
No, I' m cool.
You gonna wake up that thing in your hand
[Tigers screaming]
Poetry in motion, Philly!
Good job.
[sighs]
Yeah.
lnspiring speech, Phil.
Hey, Patty.
Hey, darling.
How you doing?
Looking great out there.
Yeah.
Tough game today, eh?
All right, look.
No.
No, he' s not going to be a benchwarmer.
Not on your team.
'Cause I' m, uh, I' m gonna coach the Tigers.
Ooh, ouch.
[laughing]
You really think you can coach in my league?
Okay.
Be forewarned, muchacho.
You' re in the show now.
Really?
Honey, that' s great.
Why are you so angry?
No, this -- this isn' t angry.
Yay.
Yep.
Come on.
(Ann) Hi.
We didn' t get to introduce ourselves last time.
I' m Ann Hogan.
Donna Jones.
Hi.
Hi, Byong Sun.
Hi, Byong Sun.
All right.
Yeah, Byong Sun' s real shy.
Good.
Thank you.
I' m sorry, I' m sorry, who' s your son?
Byong Sun.
Actually, I...
You know what, I don' t see.
Wow!
We' re at every game.
Not like a lot of the other parents.
[chuckles]
Better!
[both chuckling]
No, no, I mean -- I mean, they' re -- Well, they' re different.
No, I...
You' re different because you' re better.
How are they better?
No, look...
You' re both better different in a different but better way.
Okay.
You know what, let' s get the rest.
A little early to start playing favorites, Phil.
[children yelling]
Okay, guys, let' s take the field.
(Sam) Get up, Dad.
(Hunter) Nice fall.
(Ambrose) Love it, yeah!
Great.
I don' t know, it may just be me, but, uh, I really got a feeling like we could catch fire and have a great season.
Huh?
Now, who' s with me?
It' s electric in the air!
Thank you for that show of enthusiasm.
Start with you.
Hey, Hunter.
Hi, Phil.
Uh, l- I' il eat this worm for $5.
How would that help us?
Ugh!
Did you just eat that?
Pass it to someone else.
I' m Byong Sun.
(Phil) Hi, Byong Sun.
I am a very kind person.
Anything that relates to soccer?
You know, maybe you and Ambrose could -- could team up.
He' s big.
[chuckles]
I' m Mark Avery.
You know, I like to keep my pimp hands strong.
You dig, cracker?
You feel me?
W- What does that mean?
I really don' t know.
Great.
Okay, yeah.
Shoot.
Remember when you called us out onto the field and you fell over?
Right.
Yeah?
I got you good!
Somebody call the burn unit.
I got you bad!
How did I get burned?
Doesn' t matter.
Uh, you know what?
Let' s just do some drills.
Now, this one, all the great players have done at one time or another.
It' s called "the snake."
Hey!
Okay, that' s not the snake.
[Holla by Baha Men playing]
Uh...
It' il get better.
No, it' s gonna get worse.
No.
They weren' t listening to me.
They were like 4- foot whirling dervishes.
You know why?
'Cause I' m not a coach.
Okay?
I don' t know what I' m doing.
He' s a coach.
He knows the game.
He' s confident, he' s smart, witty, dynamic, vicious, brutal, vindictive.
A monster.
And he will win through intimidation and forceful tactics if need be.
I' m not like that.
ln fact, I don' t know anyone like that.
So, Paul, what' s on your mind?
Uh, actually, it' s Phil.
You mean, it' s not Paul?
No, it' s Phil.
What' s the difference?
Spit it out.
Uh, here it is.
Hold this.
No, no, we do not allow smoking in the house.
l- I' m sorry, Mrs. Ditka.
Here, I' il get rid of it, honey.
Anyway, uh, l- I' m coaching my son' s soccer team.
And -- And l -- I didn' t know if you might be willing to help.
Soccer?
Actually, uh, l -- I want you to assistant coach.
You really don' t know who I am, do you?
Silly idea.
My dad' s gonna be riding me all season, so I just --
Oh- ho- ho- ho- ho, your dad?
You mean I get to coach against your dad?
Well, yeah.
(Diana) Mike, I smell smoke!
Mike!
For Pete' s sake!
So, like, it' s me and you against your old man?
I mean, there are other teams.
Gotcha!
No smoking means no smokin '!
Okay, come on, Phil.
I' il throw this out the window, honey.
Uh, l- I' m sorry, Mrs. D....
You should be.
Hey.
Really?
Oh, great.
[blowing whistle]
I' il give you a hint.
Hall of Fame?
Chicago Bears?
No, football.
Coached the 1986 --
'85.
Uh, '85 Bears to a Super Bowl victory?
It' s Mike Ditka.
Yeah.
Do you know Sammy Sosa?
I' m a coach that knows about winning.
I' m gonna push you guys like you' ve never been pushed before.
I know it' s a weird thought, but it' s true.
I eat quitters for breakfast and I spit out their bones.
Delicious.
When it' s over...
When it' s over...... you guys are gonna be champions.
By God, you' re gonna be champions.
Come on.
Come on, everybody.
Let' s go out and kick some butt.
On three.
(all) One, two, three.
Let' s have fun.
"Let' s have fun?"
We' re gonna make some changes around here.
Move it!
Faster!
Move it!
Move it!
(Byong Sun) Faster.
No candy!
Your mother said you can' t have any candy!
No candy.
Please?
Hey!
I got eyes in the back of my head.
All the way!
But, coach, how is this gonna help me with soccer?
It' s not gonna help you with soccer, but I' m gonna get my trash taken out, okay?
Shouldn' t we be going to soccer practice?
Come on.
You' re great.
Hey, Sam.
Good.
Jeez!
[people cheering]
Are you following me?
Shake it off, Sam.
Good job, Jack!
That' s a legitimate goal, right?
10 more of those and we' re in business.
Very, very funny.
You all had a laugh?
Fine!
Play on!
Sorry about that.
How much do you think those things are?
[people applauding]
(all) 2, 4, 6, 8, WHO --
Shut up you little rats!
They' re just showing their appreciation.
Forget the appreciation.
I wanna win a soccer game!
Okay.
Hey, can I have this?
All right!
Uh, good game, everyone.
So what' d you bring, Phil?
Fishes?
No!
No, no, no.
Finches.
Birds.
Come on.
Come on, guys.
We have to keep them?
Why is this fun?
(Buck) I want to welcome you all to tonight' s
Every year, we like to take a little time for the coaches to come up here to tell us a little about their team.
(man) All right.
How about I bring up someone who' s new to coaching in this league, but is close to me?
I love him like a son.
(all) Come on, Phil.
Good guy.
Thanks, Dad.
Uh, thanks, Janice.
Hello, uh,
I' m, uh, I' m Phil Weston.
[audience laughing]
He' s got vitamins.
Hilarious.
So when I took over for Coach Benson --
[audience laughing]
Actually, uh, truth be told, no one knows where he is right now.
I don' t know why that' s funny.
God, I' m going to be honest, I -- I didn' t plan on speaking tonight.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce Mike Ditka.
[audience cheering]
It' s Mike Ditka, everyone!
Say a few words.
It' s -- It' s great to be here and, uh, gonna have a lot of fun tonight.
All right!
You live long enough, you see everything.
lron Mike and Aluminum Phil coaching the Tigers.
Ooh.
You see it, Dad?
Ditka is a great coach, we understand that, but he' s a football coach.
Understand?
We are going to win one game eventually, right?
I think.
Remember, there' s no "l" in team.
But there is an "l" in win.
There is an "l" in win.
Uh, parents, Honey.
Okay.
Phil is not the greatest coach in the world,
I can defend myself, please.
You think he enjoys losing week after week, in front of his own son?
You' re making it worse.
What' s with the birds?
I' ve got my hands full with Hunter.
Okay, you know what?
All right?
The finches were a bad idea.
And I wasn' t going to say this, but I think some of them have salmonella.
What?
I may have inadvertently poisoned your children.
You and I, we got something going.
Yeah.
Yes?
Yeah, I' d be glad to.
It' s, uh, Byong Sun.
I think I got it.
Oh, oh, okay,
Okay? thank you.
Bye- bye.
They' re great.
Just a wonderful couple.
(Phil) Yeah.
Bing Bong?
Yeah, Dad.
Hey, I' ve been meaning to talk to you about this Ditka thing.
Yeah, well, he' s right here.
What, are you trying to stick it to the old man?
You go to my mortal enemy for help?
That' s no way to talk about your neighbor.
He' s right.
What are you even doing here?
I' m glad you figured it out.
What did you call her?
I said she' s lovely and she' s young.
She' s the light of my life.
I go home when I want.
It' s Mike Ditka.
Stay out of this.
Hit the road!
I am.
Sure, I wobbled a bit, but I did not go down.
That Ditka has fists like a small truck.
Come here.
Okay.
Yeah, you need to relax.
Yeah.
Priceless.
'Cause that punch was meant for him, that' s what makes me feel so good.
Okay, Phil, can we please not talk about your dad or Ditka tonight?
l -- I...
I' m sorry.
Phil?
I love you.
What does that have to do with anything?
I quit.
What for?
He scares me.
Have you ever looked into his eyes?
Or at his hair?
Well, he' s been coaching for a long time.
Share your feelings with him.
You want me to share my feelings of inadequacy with Mike Ditka?
What else can you do?
You' re right.
You' re right.
You' re always right.
I' m sorry.
Okay?
And, Phil...
Yeah? try not to cry in front of him.
[bawling]
Hey, hey, get a grip on yourself, okay?
Here, drink this coffee.
I don' t like coffee.
Hey, coffee is the number one drink in the world.
Even little kids in Mexico drink coffee.
[sobbing]
Okay? ln fact, I don' t know who I am.
I took a long hard look at myself in the mirror, and you know what I saw?
What?
My dad, he' s something.
I mean, I' ve never lived up to my dad' s expectations.
And to top it all off, I' m letting Sam down.
Ah.
I don' t care about that.
Why is everyone slapping me lately?
It' il make you feel better.
Um, uh,
Uh- huh. yeah, it' s good.
It' s the lifeblood that drives the dreams of champions.
Now, you gotta tell me the problem, but if you cry, I' m out of here.
l -- I can' t do it.
I can' t coach.
I can' t beat my old man.
You can beat your dad!
He' s just a man.
This coaching business, Paul, is tough stuff.
Phil.
Whatever.
And when you lose, it all comes down on you.
But listen, when you put it all together, and you win, it' s the greatest feeling in the world.
It' s like winning the Super Bowl.
I' m sorry.
But I got a good idea.
Maybe we take a shortcut, stick it to your old man real good.
Okay.
Umberto!
Don' t you worry, I got you bratwurst all ready.
Grazie.
Are your nephews working today?
Go back and take a look at these guys.
Really?
Yeah, yeah.
(Umberto) Maria?
Pretty impressive, huh?
Yes!
These kids are the right age, and they live in the district.
Why not?
Your -- Your two nephews... (Umberto) Si?
Uh, would -- would they be interested in, uh, playing soccer?
(Phil) Yeah.
No, no, no, they not play soccer.
[speaking ltalian]
They play with American kids, they -- they pick up English.
Sammy Sosa.
No.
Okay!
But remember.
Yes!
Every great thing in life starts with a brat.
I know we' re on a five- game losing streak, but I' ve got good news.
I' ve got two new players joining the team.
Guys, Gian Piero and Massimo.
Now, these boys are from ltaly, okay?
Shut up.
Prima what?
You fellows, put these on.
Crazy!
New game plan.
[all cheering]
(all) 2, 4, 6, 8, who do we appreciate?
Oh.
Get enough pizza?
There' s more where that came from.
You guys, you all played great.
So did Gian Piero and Massimo who couldn' t be here because:
Meat comes first!
Got you a gift.
Soccer Dan lnstructional DVD.
We' re gonna keep learning as we go.
This will take us to the next level.
Watch it.
I only watched it for 5 minutes, I already -- I already learned this.
Maybe back over here.
(Barbara) What is going on in there?
Who did that?
(all) He did!
What?
Nah!
Okay.
All right!
Why don' t our two new players speak any English?
Because they' re ltalian.
You didn' t know English that whole first year of your life.
What' s that haunting aroma?
This is my son, Sam, and l -- I' m brand new to coffee.
Can you take half of the regular version of the coffee and mix it with half of the decaffeinated version?
Another Half- Caff.
Go.
Who' s going to play with me?
Tap and pull?
Mama mia.
You' re a real duffer, you know?
I' m not worthy.
How do you say "pizza" in ltalian?
Pizza.
How do you say "spaghetti?"
ltalian is easy.
Thank you.
Where' re you from?
Australia.
Thank you.
You still waiting for your coffee?
Thanks for the tip.
It' s something you don' t know at first.
Would you look at those ltalians go?
Okay, Bucky, it was, like, so awesome.
They just score and score and score and score and score and score and score.
Aw.
Okay, go!
Hey!
Are you serious?
I' il go change in my car.
Hey, Philly.
No, I mean the air.
Smells fresh.
What do you mean?
You what?
Yeah.
You' re serious?
Yeah, you bet I' m serious.
Looks like somebody needs to be taken down a couple of notches.
What is the law, Phil?
The law says:
"You shall never beat the old man at anything."
Okay.
You a little klutzy?
Okay, here we go.
Sorry.
Huevos Rancheros.
You wanna quit now?
[laughing]
You okay?
[groaning]
Honey?
Who' s your trainer?
Stop talking and serve!
Now, I bury you.
That' s the best I' ve ever played against him.
Yeah, it didn' t grind the barbecue to a halt at all.
You made an excellent impression on your son, by the way.
Hey, l -- I almost had you.
What do you call that again, when you almost win?
Oh, yeah, yeah, losing.
I' il tell you, Dad.
You wanna make a bet?
Yeah?
We' il bet.
I beat you, and you sell that break- even snake- oil stand of yours.
No.
Uh?
[imitating chicken clucking]
But if I win...
I get the Pelé ball.
Do what?
It' s mine.
(commentator) Here comes Pelé.
I got it.
Dad?
What?
Can I have the ball?
I caught it.
Why?
[imitating chicken clucking]
Yeah?
We got ourselves a bet, okay?
Good.
Yes.
Good.
Yeah, I think we' re gonna have to cut you off, sir.
Line 'em up.
Your wife told me about the bet you made with your old man.
What of it?
So maybe you should --
Maybe you should worry more about the team and less about the schedule.
What?
Yeah.
Bring it in, guys.
Let' s go.
Okay, guys.
Yeah?
I saw a bunch of nonsense out there.
What was going through your head out there last week?
I was breaking my back for you, Coach, because of my love for the game.
Jack.
What?
Who are you supposed to pass the ball to?
Alex, when?
The instant you come in contact with the ball.
That' s our strategy.
How many sarcastic pills did you take this morning?
"But, Coach..."
He started it.
I seem to remember a certain little boy who was very sad when he lost.
I' m doing this for you, okay?
So that we can have fun.
Right?
Okay.
Yeah.
Hey, you' re -- you' re late.
Uh, there' s a problem.
Wait, where' s Gian Piero and Massimo?
We were supposed to pick them up.
Hey, what' s going on?
[all gasp]
Where are my ltalians?
Huh?
Shut up!
Uh, do I have to say that?
What are you saying, eh?
Hello?
Umberto?
All right, guys.
[saw whirring]
[all yelling]
Sorry we' re late.
One of -- One of my guys didn' t bring his socks.
[whistle blowing]
Run!
Run to the car!
We won.
Two, four, six, eight, who do we appreciate?
Phil, it' s freezing out here.
It' s Coach Weston.
And it' s not freezing out here.
Then why did you build a fire?
Because fire is the stuff of warriors.
And that' s what we are, right?
The Hopi lndians called fire... [speaking gibberish]
We' re bonding.
Surviving the elements, here in the backyard.
Coach, did you order the pizzas yet?
All right.
We' re not gonna eat him.
But he does look delicious, you have to admit, right, if we had to eat someone?
What?
The lrish Cream sounds good, huh?
What' s that?
Uh, it' s cream and it' s, uh, it' s lrish.
Thank you.
What' s in that?
We want coffee.
Buddy, relax.
Do you have scones?
I recognize that!
I' m part of the club.
I have a card.
Do you have a card?
Do you have a card?
No, I don' t have a card.
Does anyone here have a card?
We don' t have frequent drinker cards.
Zip it there, Sporty Spice.
Are we doing this?
ls this happening now?
Wanna go?
Great.
I' d love to.
Come on.
You' re hurting me!
You' re hurting me!
What is wrong with you, Derrick?
I thought we were friends!
My name is Andy!
Your name is Liar, 'cause you' re telling lies.
I will never come back here again?
There' s a good chance of that!
Okay, if that' s how you want to play it.
I am disappointed!
Get the -- [indistinct chattering]
Tigers, bring it in.
[whistle blowing]
All right, Tigers.
Let' s get ready to play, huh?
I don' t wanna see any laziness there, okay?
I want you to play dirty, if you have to, but don' t get caught.
Byong Sun, stay low, okay?
That' s easy for you.
Ambrose, you' re big.
lf you break someone' s collarbone, that' s a good thing.
Otherwise, he' s just sitting around, all right?
You hear me?
Hey, Phil.
You don' t -- you don' t think?
You' re my assistant, okay?
You' re supposed to back me up and go get me juice boxes when I tell you.
You know who you' re talking to?
You' re crazy!
Why don' t you go to hell?
No, you go to hell!
I' m no juice box boy, I' il tell you that!
Yes, you are!
Yes, you are!
Yes, you are!
No, I' m not!
I' m not like my old man!
I' il see you,
Mr. Big Time Coach.
I' m a kind and gentle, compassionate human being, with a heart as big as a lion!
Do it!
Parents, too!
Guys...
Who are we?
On three!
Break someone' s clavicle!
Let' s go.
(Phil) Move it!
Move it!
Tuck in your shirt!
What are you doing?
Have a sense of pride, huh?
ln fact, why don' t you take a lap?
(woman) Over here, Son.
He' s right there.
He' s right there.
[groans]
[grunts]
How does that feel?
(referee) Hey!
Defense!
Come on!
Yeah?
Not now, Sam.
Can you put me in?
Go grab some bench.
There we go, Gian Piero.
Think you can mark him?
Yeah, I could take him.
Four on one, three on another, right?
We have to -- We really have to smother them.
Did you just push a kid to the ground?
Back and forth!
We' re in the finals!
All right!
Losers!
Loser!
We won, Byong Sun!
(Donna) All right.
Honey!
That' s it.
(Barbara) Hold him down.
Get the rope!
What in the world happened to your dad?
I don' t know.
I' m never drinking coffee as long as I live.
[explosion]
Wh- What is with the coffee?
Okay, you know what, Phil?
You gotta stop.
You' ve gone overboard.
What are you talking about?
You called a group of 10- year- olds "losers."
Everyone heard you.
What do you want me to call them?
'Cause that would make me a liar, okay?
And at least, give me that.
I am not a liar.
You just lied, just a -- When?
Okay, you got me on that one.
That' s one lie, though.
Am I the only one who cares about that?
Where' s Sam?
Well, Sam' s up in his room.
Very depressed.
Depressed?
You didn' t play him, Phil.
That is patently untrue.
And as far as Sam not playing in the game, that' s his fault.
What?
He needs to speak up, okay?
I can' t talk to you about this.
No, not anymore.
I don' t even know who you are.
You' re not human, that' s for sure.
An animal?
Where are you going?
I' m going.
Coffee will make you feel better.
The eye of the tiger (Phil) Barbara, are you there?
It' s me.
Game' s about to start.
Where' s Sammy?
Hello?
You know what, I gotta run.
What are you?
Who dresses you these days?
No.
Good.
And you think this suit' s gonna help you?
He' il be here.
Okay.
Guys, listen up.
Why are you whispering?
Who are those guys over there, huh?
What do you say?
Okay.
You step on this field, this is all about you.
Okay?
That' s not gonna be me.
I' m gonna be just great.
I' m gonna be great.
Let me hear you say that we can do this.
Again.
One more time.
We can do this!
One, two, three, Gladiators!
I' il be giving you a play- by- play, blow- by- blow of what promises to be the game of the year.
Tigers versus the Gladiators.
Immediately stolen by Massimo!
Defense!
Deep!
Are you ready for this?
Shot!
It' s off the mark.
What?
What' s up, farty pants?
Bring it on.
I could eat a box of cookies for dinner if I want to.
What?
No.
'Cause you' re a fart- face kid.
Oh, my God!
And they pass it of to little Byong Sun!
No, no.
Weak kick!
Stolen away and kicked way downfield.
Gladiators moving the ball.
Catch up.
They find Bucky Weston in the open.
Score!
Gladiators tie the game.
Byong Sun!
I thought I had the shot.
You thought?
How many times do I have to say this?
Okay, you cannot talk to him --
That?
Coaches here, now!
Let me ask a question.
How much you pay him to make those calls?
Can' t a guy just be enthusiastic about the game?
Now, go to your places!
Wow!
What was that all about?
Here' s all I heard.
Any more questions?
Move it.
[boys cheering]
[chuckles]
What did I just say?
Bucky with another open shot.
Yes!
Gladiators take the lead.
Was anyone listening?
The Italians have effectively been shut down.
Great.
[whistle blowing]
That' s the half.
Honey, wh- where have you been?
What?
Why isn' t Sam in his uniform?
It took me all morning to convince him to come.
What, he doesn' t want to play for me?
Sound familiar?
I' m not crying.
Don' t worry.
Don' t bother me, okay?
I promise you, I' il play you next season, okay?
Let' s say, "We are Gladiators."
Sam, you think I could talk to you?
Honey, do you mind?
So, I just was thinking, uh...
You know, grown- ups are always telling kids how they mess up, right?
You think?
I just got caught up in everything.
I really lost my way, I mean,
I apologize.
Okay.
Yeah.
You' re starting the second half.
Yeah.
You' re not worried about losing the game?
No, I' m worried about losing you.
So, go suit up.
Okay?
It' s bad?
I just want you guys to know that I know that I blew it.
l -- l -- l -- I completely blew it.
I am very, very, very, very sorry.
You know what I mean.
You -- You guys are great kids.
lnstead, I wasn' t, 'cause I' m a lousy coach and I didn' t teach you anything.
What are you talking about?
Does that make sense?
What have l -- What have I told you to do?
Gian Piero, Massimo, we' il get some fresh legs in there.
Give you guys a rest?
Yeah.
Okay.
Thanks.
Don' t remember that one.
What else?
The most important thing is -- is having fun and trying your best, all right?
Sound like a plan?
Bring it in.
Yes.
(Phil) What are we gonna do?
(Jim) Down by one, the Tigers have both Italians sitting on the bench?
Odd move by Coach Phil Weston.
Goal, and the Tiger goalie goes down hard!
That' s the intensity I' ve been looking for.
That' s it.
Hey, ref? lnjury?
Time out?
Would you mind?
You look like you need those.
Thank you.
Appreciate that.
(Phil) You all right?
All right?
ls that better or worse?
Better or worse?
Okay.
Okay.
Hey, keeper.
[gags]
Can you smell it?
All right, Mark!
It' s the smell of victory, baby!
I love you, Dad!
Wait a second, what' s going on?
It' s like they' re forming some sort of mega person.
Did everyone see that?
Way to go, Bing Bong!
ls that legal, ref?
Okay.
Team.
And Massimo steals the ball.
And the ball goes to Ambrose who fakes.
Watch it!
(Phil) Way to go, guys!
Where did you learn to move like that, Sam?
Great game, Bucky.
See you at the barbecue.
Sorry, Grandpa.
What, are you kiddin 'me?
lf anyone' s gonna beat me, I' m glad it was you.
So, you' re not mad?
[chuckles]
I' il never be mad at you.
(Phil) Burgers look good, right?
That one' s dead.
Looks good to me.
[machine humming]
Hey, Ditka!
Would you knock it off?
Hey, Buck.
Yeah.
Remember when, uh, when I shoved that kid in the pool?
[gasping]
Yeah.
How do you want your hamburger?
Thanks, Buck.
Hey.
Yeah.
Look, I just wanna say I' m sorry for the way I acted.
You were a ravin 'maniac.
Yes, I was.
Yeah, but I see you changed your ways.
Thank you.
Okay.
But you and I, we' re good?
Listen.
Hey, do what you gotta do.
I' m about to make good on that Pelé bet.
You wanna come over and watch?
We had a bet.
Good job.
Thank you.
I' m proud of you, Son.
I appreciate that.
The real Pelé ball.
Take good care of it.
It does, doesn' t it?
Here.
You keep it.
You beat me, Philly.
Well, the Tigers beat you.
I mean I had a good time kicking your butt,
It' s not.
No, no, no, Dad.
l- l- It' s not about the ball.
I don' t want the ball.
Then what do you want?
(announcer) And now an important message from the King.
Hi, I' m Buck Weston.
Hello, I' m Phil Weston.
At prices so low, it' il blow your top.
We' ve got something for that, too.
See?
Think of what I' m saying
Work it out when you' re dating >> Napisy pobrane z http: // napisy. org << >>>>>>>> nowa wizja napisów <<<<<<<<
Oh, this is Sixth Sense.
I' ve never seen this.
Bruce Willis is dead.
What?
Bruce Willis, he' s a ghost.
Why would you tell me that?
I don' t know.
Makes me feel good.
Thanks a lot.
Oh, Million Dollar Baby.
You seen it?
- No.
She dies.
What?
She breaks her neck and she dies.
You' re a mean little dude.
Gentlemen, I am proud to announce that my comrade and I have reclaimed the high score in Hell Hunters.
That' s probably 'cause you' re the only ones at the bar who still play that game.
So there we are, face to face with a brain- thirsty mob of zombies.
That' s when I spot the zombie fuel truck.
But before I take aim --
I blast it.
It' s like we' re one mind with two bodies.
Neither of which will ever get laid.
Hey, thanks for that break, Jason, I needed it.
Who' s Russ Thompson?
He' s the democrat running for Manhattan Borough President whose campaign I' ve been working on.
We' re going to his fundraiser tomorrow night.
I' m pretty sure we' ve been through this.
This may shock you, but I don' t listen to a lot of what you say.
I put a flyer on the bulletin board.
We have a bulletin board?
We cannot let him lose to that republican douche bag Jack Clark.
Look, I' m as big a Democrat as the next guy who doesn' t vote.
I can' t go.
I gotta go do a recognize tomorrow night.
A "recognize"?
What are you talking about?
Whenever my boss starts dating a new girl, he likes me to show up at the restaurant and pretend to recognize him.
Makes the girl think he' s still famous.
Glad to see your econ major' s paying off.
But, I mean, why are you still working for that lunatic?
Because that lunatic is my ticket to rock immortality.
The guy made Rolling Stone' s list of all- time top record producers.
Didn' t his last album totally tank?
Yeah, but what do you expect?
It was the Bachman- Turner Overdrive without Bachman or Turner.
Okay, so no Barry.
Bobby, you' re coming, right?
No, because I' m not a Democrat.
What are you?
I' m an unregistered.
Oh, please, you' il get hungry around 6: 00 and beg me to come for the free food.
Jason, I assume you' re in.
Um, actually, I have a prior obligation.
What is it?
It' s a personal thing.
Someone has a date with an ugly chick.
What?
Aw, come on!
Personal thing.
What is it?
Is she hairy?
I don' t have a date with a hairy girl.
N- n- n- no, of course you don' t.
Because she' s... hairless?
You guys, it' s a personal thing.
And it' s none of your business.
Well, wait a minute.
I could put the hairy chick with no hair down as your plus one.
It' s about time.
She' il be here any minute.
Okay, do you want the standard routine or the "I' m from the Nobel Prize selection committee"?
Now, just keep it simple.
I will generously allow it, demonstrating to my date that not only am I very famous, but magnanimous towards my fans.
Quickly, here she comes.
You look ravishing, Kathy.
Sherry.
Very good.
Waiter, a sherry for Kathy.
What -- Nick Dresden, the big music producer!
I don' t want to embarrass you, but you are, like, a rock god.
Hey, do you think that maybe I could just get a photo with you?
Bugger off, you wanker!
So what' d you think of Thompson?
I thought he had some really good ideas.
Like, those chunks of melon wrapped in ham?
Yeah, that' s why I' m voting for him.
So I just ran into Jason and his date.
And?
Hairy or hairless?
Actually, neither.
Pretty good- lookin '.
She does have a penis, though.
Wait, what are you talkin 'about?
Jason was having dinner with a dude.
So what?
So there.
And there.
And there.
Whoa.
Are they sharing a dessert?
Creme brulee.
No wonder he didn' t want to tell us where he was going tonight.
But wait, that doesn' t mean that he' s --
Look, I' m not saying that he' s definitely --
Yeah.
Although...
We' ve known all along!
I mean, think about it.
We saw the signs.
In eighth grade, when we all went to see Jurassic Park, who snuck in to Sleepless In Seattle?
He used to design clothes for his G. I. Joes.
Jason' s gay.
What do we do now?
I think we have to tell him that we know.
I mean, why make him go on living a lie?
I agree.
Let' s make him feel really safe and comfortable.
I think I know how we can get him to open up.
We' il just tell him our stories.
What stories?
You know, the gay stuff everyone does when they' re kids.
I think that' s a great idea.
You go first.
Yeah, and then I' il go.
'Cause I' m sure mine will be the gayest.
Okay, um --
You guys remember when we went to Camp Middlewood in 1989?
And I used to get the prickly heat on my legs.
And I always wore that shorty robe?
Yeah, your kimono.
And I got baby oil on my legs because of the prickly heat.
Go on.
And, uh, there' s my bunkmate, Sheldon Dratch.
Now, Dratch used to always do this joke where he put his hand on your chair just before you sat down, and then he' d poke you in the butt.
Right, right, right, yeah.
All I got on is the shorty robe and the baby oil, you know?
So, I mean, I sit down, and, well --
Bloop.
- Bloop?
Bloop.
So, uh, for how -- how long?
Oh, just, like, a second.
Like, a couple seconds.
You know, actually, now that I think about it, it was really just an accident.
I mean, it' s not exactly a gay story --
Dude, you got Dratched!
We' il see who' s laughing when you guys tell me your stories, huh?
You guys don' t have any stories, do you?
It' s 11: 00.
Maybe Mr. Creme Brulee invited him in for a casual gay encounter.
You wouldn' t think it would take so long.
I mean, there' s no foreplay, right?
Not that I know.
I don' t know!
Shut up.
Hey, guys.
You' re lookin 'fierce.
Can I get you a glass of chardonnay?
Then we can dish.
I' m good.
Uh, so... how was your evening?
It was fine.
Did you, uh, satisfy your obligation?
Okay, what is going on with you guys?
All right, all right.
Look, I' m just gonna come out and say it.
We think that you' re hiding something from us.
And we know about the guy you had dinner with tonight.
How do you know about that?
Were you following me?
I just happened to be at the restaurant and I happened to see you two.
And he happened to take some pictures.
Who I have dinner with is none of your business.
Whatever it is, we' re cool with it.
All right, you don' t have to keep who you are a secret from us.
We' re your friends.
No matter what.
All right.
I guess I knew I' d have to tell you guys someday.
I kept it hidden for so long.
Hey, it' s cool.
It' s cool, okay?
You just let it out.
Okay.
I' m...
I' m... a Republican.
Hoo!
Wow.
Just to get it out there.
That' s your secret?
Yep.
Wow.
A gay Republican.
Why would you think that?
Well, you spend more on shampoo than I do on food.
And then tonight I catch you having a romantic dinner with a dude.
It wasn' t romantic.
I' m working with him.
Since when?
I suspected back in middle school.
But it wasn' t till the '96 election that I knew for sure.
You were so in love with Clinton.
But I just wasn' t feeling it.
At night I' d lock my door and download Bob Dole' s platform.
Okay, I just threw up in my mouth a little right there.
Man, it' s not that big a deal.
We' il just avoid talking about politics when Jason' s in the room.
Yeah, just like we avoid talking about spiders when Bobby' s in the room.
Dude, stop it!
Right now!
I' m sorry, you can' t expect me to just accept this.
That' s why I never told you.
So it' s better to lie to me all these years?
Who are you?
Don' t you think you' re blowing this a little out of proportion?
It' s just politics.
It' s not just politics.
It' s about core beliefs.
And now, I' m finding out we stand for completely different things.
Oh, and protecting the environment.
I just don' t think a bloated government is the way to get to them.
Listen to you!
"Bloated government"?
And this is why I don' t vote.
That if I' m a Republican, we can' t be friends?
I don' t know.
Oh, come on, Ben.
After everything we' ve been through together, you' re gonna let this one little thing get between us?
It' s not a little thing to me.
So.
Barry' s got a funny camp story.
So you still mad at Jason?
I' m not mad at Jason.
I' m mad at the selfish, hateful Republican ideology that fills his cold, dead heart.
What are you doing?
Sending out campaign materials for Russ Thompson.
Hello.
Hello.
May I sit?
Free country.
No thanks to you.
Stuffing envelopes?
Yes.
You too?
Yeah.
Trying to get a thousand letters out by tomorrow.
I' m gonna get a thousand out today.
- Are you?
- Good luck to you.
- And to you.
Ow!
- Ooh, paper cut?
Ow!
- Cut your tongue?
Guys!
Guys, what' s the big deal?
What' s the big deal?
Look, if he had his way, the rich wouldn' t pay taxes and Alaska would become one giant gas station.
That is such a crock.
You can' t even argue your point without resorting to hyperbole.
Ooh, big word from someone who wants to eliminate the Department of Education.
Stop it!
I may just have to get a job!
You know, Nick, there are times I wish
I' d never responded to your ad in The Village Voice.
There are times I wish I' d never responded to certain ads in The Village Voice myself.
Barry?
It' s a friend of mine.
Do I have to remind you that this is a place of business?
Bobby, what are you doing here?
We got a real problem at home.
Jason and Ben are at each other' s throats.
Barry?
Is your friend here to ask my advice?
Yes, Nick.
My friend is here to ask your advice.
Allow him to enter.
And welcome to Oz.
So... flatmates having a bit of a row?
Your Majesty.
Let me tell you a little story, boys.
1975.
It was the opening night of their Physical Graffiti tour in Manchester.
Robert Plant was angry at Jimmy Page for hiding his show scarves yet again.
They both refused to play.
But luckily, I remembered they loved deep- sea fishing.
So I hired them a boat.
Put them on it.
And let them catch a marlin.
By showtime, they were right as rain.
So the point you' re making is that by getting them together to do something they loved, it reminded them of what their friendship is really about.
No.
The point I' m trying to make is, I know Jimmy Page and Robert Plant.
So here' s the deal.
You guys need to make up.
And one time Led Zeppelin caught this fish.
So we think you should play this game together.
As sound as your argument is, buddy, our issues run pretty deep.
And I don' t think playing a video game is gonna help.
Just humor us, okay?
All right, let' s get this over with.
Fine.
- There' s one over there.
- Yeah, check.
- Oh, whoa, whoa.
Nice shot!
Good eyes.
It' s like they' re having make- up sex.
Guns aren' t always bad.
Yeah, when you' re using them to shoot zombies.
Or defending your home against an intruder.
Or when you accidentally shoot your mailman.
Hey, hey, hey.
These zombies aren' t gonna kill themselves.
They' re also not gonna wait two weeks while I get a gun permit.
Okay!
You know what?
Game over, all right?
This isn' t gonna work.
That' s one thing we can agree on.
Excuse me, I' m so --
Barry?
Yeah.
Sheldon Dratch from camp!
Sheldon freakin 'Dratch!
You have no idea how happy we are to see you.
Ben, Jason, Bobby.
This is so great.
15 years since I' ve seen you, huh?
Bloop!
But right, you know what?
We' il catch up.
Come on, Barry, you sit next to me.
W- w- wait, you gotta show me how that works one more time, Sheldon.
Sure, sure.
You see, the natural oils in my finger -- bloop -- dissipate the foam.
So you just pop your finger right up in there?
Yep.
Right up in there.
Okay, guys, we' ve taken up enough of Sheldon' s time.
Not really.
We don' t see a ring on this finger, huh?
Just hit the road, Jackass.
Same old Barry.
I better scoot.
But listen, I just wanna say how great it is that the four of you have stayed so close for so long.
Real quick, what' s your secret?
Well, we get along really well.
We have a lot of history.
What do you guys think?
We' re... kind of the brothers we never had.
Yeah.
We know each other better than anyone else.
And we just -- I guess we just try not to let stuff get between us... usually.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Usually.
I hope you realize that.
Seriously, get out.
Boom, boom, boom.
So, you wanna go splatter some zombie brains, you fascist?
Commie.
Sheldon Dratch just happened to show up here?
Not really.
I looked him up in the phonebook and invited him.
Got any more movies you wanna ruin for me?

Chantal?
Shouldn' tyou get that?
- Hello?
Victor Benezet here.
How areyou?
As well as can be expected under the circumstances.
I' m sorry to call you like this, but I need you to come in.
- It' sjust a few questions.
lunderstandwhy you were distressedyesterday... but we do need to make a proper report.
I' m giving the toast tonight.
And I' m looking forward to it, old boy.
It' s a fund- raiser.
This' il only take ten minutes.
Seeyou at the station, then.
Theywon' t serve dinner until you' re fi nished.
Ifyou' re hungry, write a check, because I can crawl all night.
Henry loves being the center ofattention, don' tyou?
- Yes, go ahead.
I have a position for a good handyman... in caseyou ever tire ofthese long policeman' s hours.
Nothing works around here.
I do appreciateyour coming in on such short notice, Henry.
You look marvelous.
- You getyounger every day.
- Thankyou, Victor.
You met Detective Owens yesterday at the house.
Same toyou, Mr. Hearst.
I' il burn us some coffee.
Nonfat milk ifyou have it.
I don' t think he heard me, actually.
He reminds me a lot ofyou.
Only listens when it suits him.
That' s unfair, Henry.
Not only am I a good listener... but I keep it all in here.
Anyway, we should have this cleared up in no time.
Oh, no.
No need for that formality.
I do apologize about the timing.
Wejust need to clarify some ofthe details from your report.
Your superintendent is one ofthe charity' s biggest supporters.
So ifyou' il help us put an end to some ofthese nagging questions -- why, we' il haveyou on yourway.
I would' ve thoughtyou' d be at the party already.
Tuxedo' s all ready to go.
I must say, Henry, you seem in high spirits... what with all this on your doorstep.
How should I behave?
Waiting.
A noble quality in thatyoung woman.
Something mine didn' t seem to want to do.
We always thoughtyou made a charming couple.
Charming, perhaps... but dull, apparently.
You see the children much?
Both ofmy daughters are living with their mother... back in New York City.
Must be hard during the holidays and all.
We should get on with it.
- No milk?
No, thanks.
You' re into charity.
Why don' tyou fund- raise us up a cappuccino machine... so all the lowlifes that come through here can enjoy a solid cup ofcoffee?
I wasjust going to ask Mr. Hearst about the dog.
Right.
The "mystery dog."
Actually, I like "ghost dog."
Can we start again?
I come in here likeyou ask... and Mr. Congeniality here is taking a hostile mannerwith me.
It' s this case, Henry.
It has everyone on edge.
This business is strange... going bywhat' s in the record.
But let' s see.
You sayyou were... outjogging with a dog.
Yes.
Man' s best friend.
Belonging to a neighbor ofyours... named Ricardi.
You ever own one?
When I was a boy, my family had Great Danes.
Butyou don' t own one now?
Chantal prefers cats.
- So, doyou have a cat?
- Too unsanitary.
What doyou mean?
Cats are always licking themselves.
Thing had me up all night slurping away.
A dog is a lot more unsanitary... but at least when they' re sleeping, they sleep.
Thankyou for that.
Anyway, the messiest is a canary.
She refused that too.
But for once I stuck to my guns.
I can be quite fi rm ifI need to be.
What was his name again?
Tango.
Doyou write that just like "tango"?
How else would you write it, like "waltz" or "fox- trot"?
When you were questioned... you said...
What we' re not clear about here is what the dog was doing.
Logically, you would expect that the dog would have found the girl.
Well, I suppose it did.
Butyou sayyou found her.
Well, me, the dog -- We were together.
What difference does it make?
I called the police.
Unless, perhaps, you think the dog called and disguised his voice.
Mr. Hearst... twoyoung girls have been found strangled... within the past 1 6 days.
It is myjob to fi nd the murderer.
You' re a principal witness to the crime scene.
Now, I have to make sure that the facts ofyour statements... agree with the other facts ofthe case.
Mr. Hearst doesn' t appear to be as distressed today.
I' m a guest here.
I' il be treated with respect, Sergeant Opie.
- That' s Detective Owens.
- O- W -- - Please!
Let' s all -- Let' s all relax.
Everyone has somewhere else they' d like to be.
Now, Henry, ifyou don' t mind... please... tell us one more time howyou came upon the girl.
I grabbed the dog.
Better run him a little faster, Henry.
He' s getting a belly as round as yours!
Fuckin 'old geezer.
Let' s go!
This dog --
He was defi nitelywith you?
What dialect doyou need this in?
Yes, the dog was with me.
The dog was with me.
Got it?
Good.
Tango' s all right.
Keeps me company on my runs.
- SuddenlyTango wasn' t there.
- Tango, come on, boy!
I called to him, but he wouldn' t come.
I could hear him.
He was growling, barking... actingpeculiar.
That' s when I turned back.
Tango, come on, boy.
The dog wouldn' t come.
You couldn' t see the girl at this point?
Obviously not from the path.
But I could see Tango in there moving around.
Soyou ventured off into the grove.
That' s when I saw her.
At fi rst I thought she was asleep.
She was almost -- I want to say -- angelic.
The way shejust lay there.
Her eyes -- Theywere dark brown.
Theywere still open.
Sue Ellen Huddy.
She was three days shy ofher 1 3th birthday.
- How did you discern she was dead?
- I touched her.
I mean, I put my head on her chest.
There was no heartbeat.
That was that.
- The dog found the body.
Mr. Ricardi states fi rmly that you did not run the dog yesterday.
He admits that on most days you do, but notyesterday.
Well, hejust doesn' t remember right.
Well, that may be, but in that case, your neighbor...
Miss Lazzo, doesn' t remember either.
And another neighbor, Mr. Irwin, also suffers memory loss.
In the whole area, you' re the only one who remembers correctly.
- Them, naturally.
You' re taking this personally.
You know, you enjoy hounding me.
- How is that, Henry?
- You forget I know all your tricks.
A murder by some thug or nutcase -- That' s average.
But when it' s a pillar ofthe legal community... that' s more than just a witness --
Then it' s banner headlines, television.
It' d help in your push to become our next police superintendent, right?
Confess.
See?
I gotyou.
Let' s sayyou' re right.
Everything you say.
I bag a prominent attorney... hang his pelt on the trophywall ofmy new luxurious offices.
What aboutyour neighbors, then?
Areyou saying that they' re all out to getyou too?
- How would I know?
- Whywould they be?
Maybe because I' m very rich?
Because I have a big house... and a glamorous wife.
I have these things, and it happens I don' t deserve them.
My looks are entirely ordinary, and I' m no genius.
Mediocre people tolerate success... when it comes to someone exceptional like a movie star or an athlete... but when it comes to one oftheir own... then it strikes them as being an injustice.
You agree?
I thinkwe' re getting a little far afield.
Interesting thing is, there were no dog prints found at the murder scene... and we know that without the dog... you neverwould' ve seen the body.
In otherwords, your ghost dog story reeks.
There were dead leaves everywhere.
How doyou make dog prints in dead leaves, Detective Opie?
Tell me.
You' re a tax attorney.
Good at making up fantasies.
That' s what they payyou for, right?
The dog was there. Jesus.
Hold it.
Damn.
They' re all correct about Tango.
I didn' t pick him up at Ricardi' s.
I met him out on the path.
Geez.
Really had me going there for a sec.
He gets out sometimes, and he runs around the gardens.
Halfthe time...
Ricardi doesn' tevenknow he' s missing until lbring him back.
I remember now... that I called him.
Come on.
- Yeah, Tango' s my buddy.
Aren' tyou?
Go on.
Perhapsyou' il understand howour earsprick up... every timeyourstory changes.
Yes, andlcertainlyhope this one works... because I' m banking on this lame dog story to get me off the hook.
How much longer do I gotta put up with this --
You' re out ofline.
Good boy.
Speaking ofdogs, you keepyours on a leash.
Now, you listen to me, Victor.
This is getting ridiculous.
When you called me, you told me it was gonna be ten minutes.
Now look at this.
I can see the notion ofcivic duty and being a good citizen isjust a myth.
- I don' t rememberwho said it -- - You don' t seem to remembervery much.
I don' t rememberwho said the police will ensure public safety everywhere... except inside a police station.
You called before anyone knew Sue Ellen was missing.
Well, does that make me the murderer?
It says right here, "I ran home and called the police."
I wasn' t thinking.
Or maybeyou thought, "I' d betterwash up fi rst."
I don' t likeyour tone.
And frankly, I' m beginning to fi nd yours more and more interesting.
What areyou recording?
Doyou have any idea whyyou' re still here?
Maybeyou should call a lawyer down here.
I am a fucking lawyer!
This isJanuary 7, 8: 06 P. M.
I' m Captain Benezet.
We' re talking to Mr. Henry Hearst.
Doyou haveyour permission to tape this interview, Henry?
Why not?
Thankyou.
Now, then -- your name, age, profession and marital status.
Come on.
Name, age, profession and marital status, please.
Youjust said my name.
Whatever.
Hearst.
I' m 57.
Yes.
Senior partnerwith Hearst, Dean and Dumet right here in town.
You must have a lot offancy computers up there in that office.
You ever surfthe Net?
Check out the chat rooms and the websites?
I don' t know about chat rooms, but sure.
What does this have to do with anything?
Any other hobbies?
Computers are not my hobby.
I have my own darkroom.
I enjoy chronicling the island' s history.
- And you' re married.
- Yes.
- Ten years now.
- And no children.
Yes.
And no children.
Why not?
Chantal won' t -- Chantal can' t have children.
She has a fertility problem.
What difference does it make?
You ever hear ofadopting?
You walk somebody else' s dog.
That' s very elegant.
Doyou think that' s elegant?
This is what I think.
I remember that you couldn' t afford law school.
I rememberyou waiting on tables.
We' d swagger in, drunk... trotting along hot- looking dolls, spending moneyyou know we didn' t earn.
I think the matter at hand is payback.
When Detective Owens arrived atyour house at 6: 54 P. M. yesterday... he noted thatyou were not wearingjogging clothes.
- I showered.
- Beforeyou called?
Ofcourse not.
lcalledas soonas lcamehome.
Whatisyour emergency?
I want to report a dead body.
Officers also noted thatyourwife had notyet been told about the girl.
She was in the bedroom.
It says hereyou called from the bedroom.
- When you got home?
Please don' t go into this now, Victor.
- Damn it, Henry!
She was not.
The dog was not.
Tell me one thing that adds up... so we can go across the street and have a good time.
But I was.
I was there.
Downstairs there' s that --
- Upstairs it gets instructive.
Mr. Hearst didn' t say "special."
Thankyou.
There' s ahallway, right?
The extra bedrooms were for the children, which were never used.
The guest bedroom was redecorated for mywife.
Our old room is now mine.
In between... the hallway.
You have separate bedrooms.
My lovely Chantal' s affl iction is the green- eyed monster.
They say thatjealousy is all the fun you think somebody else is having.
Chantal can be unbearable, I promiseyou.
She have reason to be?
Regardless ofwhatyou think ofme, I do love mywife.
The only thing I everwanted was to be happywith Chantal... and have children.
But the pitter- patter oflittle feet... was not to be.
It certainly pays to advertise.
Ben, Thomas, I caughtyou in the act.
Married men should be more subtle.
- Where' s Henry?
- He' il be right along.
Had a business matter to tidy up.
I thought I saw him walking into the police station... as we drove up to the valet.
He' il be right along.
Well, what do we discuss now?
We' ve pretty much exhausted canaries and dogs.
Let' s talk about the fi rst murder, ifyou don' t mind, down in La Perla.
Paulina Valera.
Poorislandgirl.
Mother was astreethooker living in amotelnot too faraway.
We thinkitstarted somewhere in thestreets.
Either way, thekiller leftherbodyin the dump.
Yeah?
Tell him I' il be right out.
I wantyou to tell me what you were doing in La Perla... the night Paulina Valera was killed.
I' m waiting to introduce good citizen Henry Hearst... in, let' s see, 29 minutes.
- And I' m told he' s still in there.
- That' s right.
Victor, doyou realize how important this fund- raising event is?
Yes, we have two dead girls.
But we also have countless children... whose homes were blown away in the hurricane.
We have open sewers.
- We have a cholera epidemic.
- Sir, I realize --
You obviously do not.
How will the sponsors react if Henry' s accused?
I imagine extremely grateful that their children are safe.
Just have him across the street... by 9: 00, okay?
- What timeyou got?
- Your pulse is racing.
- I' m due to give my speech!
Speech?
I' ve been told.
Two patrol officers wrote down the license plate number... ofyour Range Rover, which was parked in the vicinity ofthe crime scene.
Your expensive vehicle attracted attention.
Officers thought it might be stolen, called it in.
That puts you in the area, Henry.
Anytimeyou' re ready.
Me, I' m just hoping this is as good as ghost dog.
You know whereyou were three weeks ago, Sergeant Opie?
I was right here serving coffee to stand- up citizens likeyourself.
I was at my sister- in- law' s.
I had knocked back a few at the club... andlhadthis inspiration to drop off some Christmas gifts forthekids.
Nameandaddress, Henry.
ldon' tknowthe exactaddress, butlknow where itis.
Should be in the book.
Chantal' s older sister.
Greatkids.
- Fine.
Maria' s done a fabulousjob with them.
Merry Christmas.
Why didn' t Chantal go with you?
It' s her sister.
It' s complicated.
Paco.
Merry Christmas.
I need to know more about this.
No, you don' t.
I talkedtoher.
She says that it' s the fi rst time... that either Henry or Chantal... had stopped by in a long time.
She didn' t sound too friendly.
Whyyou pick that night to thaw the ice?
- It has nothing to do with anything.
- Where' d you go next?
I went home.
Police reported your car at 2: 1 8 A. M.
You see, this is what we here at the police --
I was driving drunk.
lmostdefinitelyneeded to walk offtheliquor.
- This place doesn' t scare me.
- Well, it should.
Where did you go?
lsatdown.
lsatdown. lfellasleep.
Woke up I don' t know when.
Felt better.
I went home.
What' s gonna stop me from shoving my fist down his throat?
The police would rather that I drove home drunk?
All right, Henry.
Let' s revisit this... bench later.
First I want an answer to my question... as to why Chantal didn' t accompanyyou that night.
lmetPaco Rodriguez.
He' s ahotlocalartist.
- Who doesn' t on this island?
- You smoke a little grass, Henry?
Doyou?
God knows it would help with your sunny disposition.
I' m thinking you don' t fancy Chantal hanging out... with a handsome, successful younger man.
- Doyou?
- Is this necessary?
- Twenty.
Right, Henry?
- You' re, what, 67, right?
Goddamn it, 57!
This is a fucking outrage.
You' ve no right to pry into my private affairs... with these soap opera insinuations.
Look atyou, Victor.
Doing a bang- upjob policing the island.
Drugs everywhere.
Just -- Crime is rampant.
You' il be lucky ifyou still have ajob.
I' m sorry.
I' m really sorry.
This is really rather unbearable for me.
Detective Owens could get me a cold drink.
Ifyou would, Detective.
My pleasure.
All right, Henry.
What' s going on here?
Doyou have anything... a little stronger stashed away around here?
What' s itgonna take togetme outofhere?
We both know that I could march in an army ofattorneys.
I' m intrigued they' re not here already, Henry.
You' re hiding something, something you don' t want to get outside this room.
Now it' sjustyou and me.
Tell me about Chantal.
You tell me about Kate and Consuelo.
Ifhaving a difficult marriage makes me a murderer... you' d be Son ofSam.
Kate and I... married tooyoung.
She grew to want somebody better.
A man with a real job... money to buy things she came to know... that other men were only too happy to buy for her.
Consuelojust hates me being a cop.
You stuckwith your guns.
You can' t tell me being a cop isn' t exciting.
And you obviously enjoy harassing people.
Wow.
Wish I could do that. "
Wouldn' t mind whatyou got, Henry.
Used to be enough.
Chantal' s green monster... extends to her sister' s marriage.
You see, Maria married for other more tried and true reasons... despite her mother' s objections.
Married a man closer to her own age.
A man ofmodest means.
Dashing young artist.
They are a breed unto themselves.
Wouldn' tyou agree?
A beautiful woman moves through life unchallenged... men giving them everything that theywant.
First their daddies, then their boyfriends and husbands.
- I' il drink to that.
- For some, beauty is their only talent.
Somebodyyounger.
Chantal' s mother taught her that.
Why areyou doing this to me, Victor?
But there' s nothing more to see.
I' il tell you what I see, Henry.
I see the bodies oftwoyoung girls, murdered.
The man who did that' s going to answer to me.
You make me sick.
Why don' tyou put a name to this phantom --
Henry Hearst, attorney- at- law -- ifyou' re so convinced that I' m guilty?
Construing my marriage to be dysfunctional... just makes it easier foryou to sell me down the river.
I' m being convinced, but not all the way.
- That' s whyyou' re still here.
- I' m still here because I choose to be.
Becauseyou asked me ifI would "drop by."
Becauseyou fed me this line ofcrap... about a couple ofquestions.
But now -- Now I' m leaving.
I' ve told my story to exhaustion.
I' ve got a ballroom full ofpeople waiting for me over there... to give my toast in exactly 1 2 minutes.
And I' ve suffered enough insults and accusations for any friend to bear.
You' re not going anywhere, Henry.
What, areyou gonna sick this knuckle- dragger on me?
In that case, be careful.
Be very careful, because you only have so many possibilities.
I know something about the law.
I' m gonna walk right out that door unless you book me here and now.
How about I detain you on suspicion?
Areyou serious?
Read him his rights.
Step inside.
You have the right to remain silent.
- Anything you say can and will be -- - On what charge?
Taking a nap on a bench?
Walking a dog without permission?
Special circumstances.
Two counts, rape... upon the persons ofSue Ellen Huddy and Paulina Valera.
I raped them as well, huh?
Ifyou cannot afford an attorney, the court will appoint one foryou.
Now, doyou understand these rights that have been explained toyou?
Seeyou outside a minute, please.
He' s one hundred fucking percent guilty.
He knows exactlywhere we' re taking him.
Yeah, you made sure ofthat.
Now, what ifhe lawyers up?
We lose him.
- We already had him.
"I was sleeping on a park bench."
I mean, my ass!
Why areyou butterballing him?
Why don' tyou let me go in there and let me drop the hammer on that guy?
I' m gonna walk across the street.
Okay?
Shut!
I saw Victor' s eyes.
As in, your butt got chewed for blowing the pooch.
Our notorious captain would love to have ambushed me with that tidbit... and owned the most devastating moment.
- You okaywith that?
- What?
I didn' t know -- diet or regular.
Bet they' re fast, huh?
Excuse me?
Little girls.
You' il be running quick, too, when I fi le my lawsuit.
You' re telling me toletaman -- whom I think in all probability... killed twoyoung girls -- walk out ofthe station?
For ten minutes, Victor.
- Has he confessed?
- Ofcourse not.
You have proofenough to arrest him?
I' ve caught him in a number oflies.
You need more than a few lies.
And until you have them...
I don' t want him retained officially.
Five minutes ago.
I thought he might take off.
He has to make his toast!
Bring him here.
No uniformed officer.
No restraint ofany kind.
See to it...
Captain.
Well, this is nice.
A little alone time.
You know, I likeyou, Henry.
Can you believe it?
And yetyou maintain a sense ofhumor about it.
Raped and strangled.
What?
You said "strangled and raped."
I wouldn' t know, especially... but these things should be put in their proper order.
Don' tyou agree, Detective?
Doyou call to them?
What do I know?
Could be the poor kids, they lured you... off into the woods and seduced you.
It happens.
You sound obsessed.
You like this sort ofthing.
I' m just curious.
I' m curious howyou operate.
Now... these little girls -- I bet they run like rabbits, don' t they?
Tell me about it.
Touch 'em?
You touch 'em like that?
What, did that hurt?
You hurt 'em, don' tyou?
- Cut it out!
"What' s your name, sweetheart?
Paulina?
That' s a pretty name.
It' s sexy, yeah.
Areyou here all byyourself?
I am too.
Cute top.
It' s a tight little blouse you got on there.
I just wanna put my -- "
Where areyou going, little girl?
- Getyour hands off me.
- Get back in the office.
You son ofa bitch.
It' s the captain.
Line three.
He what?
Never mind, Owens.
He has aspeech tomake.
When you' ve fixed your rug, I gotta run you over.
Haven' tyou done that already?
My God, Henry!
What happened?
Haveyou met my new tailor and hairstylist... the "Marquis de fucking Sade"?
This is nothing less than assault and battery, and I have witnesses!
- Witnesses to what?
- You knocked me down the stairs!
- That' s bullshit!
Come on!
- What?
- Henry, people are depending on you.
- Shut up, Julio.
Doyou mind?
Ruthanne, you' re looking lovely, as usual.
- Henry, is everything okay?
Thankyou very much.
It' s all right.
Isabella, hola.
Just pray that I' m guilty ofkilling those girls... because ifI am, then your boys worked over a monster.
But ifl' m not, the monster changes sides.
Henry, just give us that money smile.
Shit.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Happy San Sebastian.
I' m proud to introduce a man... who along with his lovelywife Chantal Hearst... has championed many charity causes in Puerto Rico.
And in the wake of Hurricane Lucy, we need him more than ever.
So, Henry, get over here and empty these people' s pockets.
Where' s his fucking hair?
Had the damn thing upside down.
Thankyou very much for coming tonight.
Whereyou been?
I' m right behind you.
When nature sends its worst, it' s as ifone ofGod' s checks has bounced.
Let' s prayyour checks don' t.
Because that' s whywe' re here.
They say no amount oflearning can cure stupidity.
- You' re certainly a candidate for -- - Ifhe' d cracked, you' d have come back --
Well, he didn' t crack, and you' re off this investigation.
- Don' t, Detective.
Learn the grammar ofsilence whileyou still hold that rank.
Now, you go back to the station.
Put on a silly hat.
Do whatever morons do.
The island is a family, one that has been torn apart.
We need to be there for each other, especially for our children.
For there' s no greater gift than a child' s smile.
Tonight.
Not tomorrow.
Victor, don' t underestimate... the resolve of Henry Hearst and his law fi rm... to raiseyour severed head on a pole... and wave it for the whole damn island to see.
We' il see whose head gets waved on that pole.
Well, that' s your decision, then... isn' t it?
In closing, I' d like to askyou to look intoyour hearts... realize what truly matters in life... and fi nd the love to help our family.
Perhaps catastrophe... is the natural human environment.
We fi nd ourselves attacked by unforeseen forces come to harm us... even though we are innocent ofanywrongdoing.
But it is human nature to overcome, ifwe work together.
So, please, help me help the children.
Thankyou.
You know, as ifI wasn' t embarrassed enough... youjerked me out ofthere without being able to chat or have dinner.
- You like chocolate?
There' s a whole machine full ofit in the hallway... and I knowyou' ve got money.
- Ofcourse I can!
Food is the least ofyour problems.
I' m going to do the best I can to seeyou get three squares a day.
Come with me.
Would you like to have a private chat with yourwife?
He' s going to set up a video camera in here while I chat with Chantal.
Why mustyou question her?
Detective Castillo will getyou some food.
- I should tell you the -- - Do it outside.
Victor, I need to know what' s happening.
Just give me a moment while I close the door.
She came in -- She was -- to me --
Is Henry here?
Can I see him?
- I need to see him.
- Doesn' t want to talk toyou.
Ifhe' s innocent, why is this taking so long?
I never said he was innocent.
Tell me aboutyour lives together as a couple.
You could start with the separate bedrooms.
He talked about that?
- And what else?
- Your sister.
Don' tyou offer to light a lady' s cigarette?
Tell me about the night he... visited your sister' s home.
What night would that be?
December 1 9, Sunday night, about 9: 00 in the evening.
I fi nd it curious thatyou chose not to accompany him.
I wasn' t aware Henry had visited my sister.
Whywouldn' t he tell you?
Obviously Henry has talked to us aboutyour marriage... howyou wish you had married someone closer toyour age, like Paco.
You' re saying Henry' sjealous ofmy sister' s husband?
Areyou having an affair with Paco?
Am I on trial now?
Can you tell me what time he got home that night?
There was a night that could be it.
It' s old, veryheavy.
It tends to slam.
Did you look at the clock?
- You must' ve been worried.
- This wasn' t the fi rst time.
Hello?
Take me into that room.
Why don' tyou answer me?
Andyoudidn' tpursueit? Or didn' t youcare toask where he was?
We don' t ask those sort ofquestions anymore.
But I' m sure you' re going to tell me.
We have reason to believe he was in La Perla... where a young girl named Paulina Valera was raped and murdered... and left on a garbage dump.
I need to know whose name the house is in.
The house was a gift.
Then may I haveyour permission to search the house?
You may not.
- You said you were hungry.
- What' d she say?
- You all set, Castillo?
- Yes, sir.
Start recording.
I was talking toyou.
Victor only listens when it suits Victor.
I was listening when you told me you left your sister- in- law' s... and drove to La Perla, thatyou went for a walk and fell asleep on a bench.
Now I' d like to hear something that vaguely resembles the truth.
- That is the truth.
- Chantal says you got home at 3: 30 A. M.
I --
- I may have had another drink.
- You happen onto Via Del Mar Boulevard?
Doyou want toparty with me?
- Did you see any hookers?
- You didn' t talk to any hookers?
- No.
- Spend time with one, perhaps?
- Absolutely not.
You' re lying, Henry.
And your eyes -- They turn down and to the left.
That' s what liars do.
It' s a fact.
Our bodies give us away.
Doyou know what these do?
They keep me awake.
Sinceyou found Sue Ellen Huddy' s body, I' ve been working straight through.
And I' ve got so much to share with you.
For instance, I accompanied those two officers... who phoned in the license number from your Range Rover.
They showed me exactlywhereyou parked.
We conducted some interviews.
Imagine my surprise when several prostitutes recognized your photo... said you' d been coming around for months.
Jesus Christ, Victor, she' s in the next room.
I' m talking about street hookers, needle users, crackheads... not high- class call girls.
Curb crawlers, for God' s sake.
God damn you.
Chantal can' t hearyou, not with the door closed.
- Unless I turn the speaker on.
- Please.
She was blond.
Obviously peroxide, being Hispanic.
She would truly have been beautiful without all that makeup.
- I never knew her name.
- Doyou miss me, huh?
Yes, you do.
I left my sister- in- law' s house... to have sex in an alley with a prostitute.
I be a good little girl foryou.
I fi nished myselfoff... drinking any goddamn thing I wanted at the Sunshine Cafe.
What doyou think?
That I' d spend my life banging on mywife' s -- mywife' s door?
I' d fi nd a substitute... someonejust the opposite from Chantal.
A prostitute is a woman who will giveyou a great deal... for relatively little money.
Well, as an alibi, I don' t know, Henry.
A lot ofwomen in Puerto Rico die their hair blond... especially in that profession, but I' il tell you what I do know.
One ofthem admittedshe' dbeen withyou last week.
Hername was Reina.
- Doyou know this man?
- No.
Yes.
She was young, much younger than the others.
And she says that' s whyyou like her.
But this must be an old picture.
- Why?
- The guy' s bald now.
- Bald?
- Mm- hmm.
You removeyour hairpiece down there as well, don' tyou, Henry?
It seems nobody remembers you with the rug.
That' s smart.
Pick 'em up inyour car, somebodymightcatch alicenseplate.
- "This one likes it quick" -- - From behind.
He pumps me hard.
At least he comes fast.
Then goes like he doesn' t want to be here.
Why, Henry?
Why here like this... in the dirt?
Think ofthehigh- class escorts youcanbuy.
And you choose this.
Don' t tell her, will you, Victor?
I imagine Chantal will be thrilled to learn you were with a prostitute... instead ofwhat you were really doing.
Rapists leave bodily fluids -- semen...
DNA.
Your test' il prove that it wasn' t me.
- You use condoms with your prostitutes?
- Ofcourse.
- What kind?
- I don' t know.
Whatever they have.
The killer used condoms.
Chemical lubricants were found in the victims.
He' s smart, likeyou.
Knows all about our lab tests.
Both victims were rapedfrom behind.
Thumbandfingerprints on the victims' necks confirmedthis.
Then you put the clothes back on.
- Then you pose them.
Each on theside...
little heads resting on cupped hands.
And you combed their hair.
And we have reason to believeyou took their photograph.
Photography is your hobby, isn' t it?
Stop it!
- I' m fi ne.
You all right?
You want some water?
I' m perfectly fi ne.
I' m just tired.
You don' t look exactly fresh as a daisyyourself.
You surf, Henry?
The Internet?
Your E- mail address is hhearst@ elpuerto. com.
You sometimes use an on- line alias. "Hard Body Hank"?
- Very catchy.
- God, does this ever end?
A simpleyes or no, Henry.
- Yes.
It seems that Hard Body Hank has visited several pornography sites... one ofwhich is called Barely Legal.
It features young ladies posed as schoolgirls.
That website features women, not children.
Christ.
Every time I check E- mail, there' s a new message from some electronic bimbo...
What' s the big deal?
And the prostitutes -- What does that prove?
That I' m lonely?
That I don' t get it at home?
That mywife makes me sleep down the hall?
And all this makes me a pedophile, a rapist, a killer ofchildren?
- Whywould I do such a thing?
- I don' t know, Henry.
Notyet.
Let' s talk about this glamorous wife who keeps poor Henry shivering in the hall.
- You know what Chantal says?
- She' s lying!
I never touched Camille.
Who' s Camille?
Let' s talk aboutyour separate bedrooms.
Henry says it was his choice; he moved out.
- He' s wrong.
- He' s wrong or he' s lying?
Let' s not quibble overwords.
But words can be very amusing.
To be honest, he says you' re not performing at all.
He has been revealing things, hasn' t he?
I' d like to hearyour side.
The most interesting things -- Those I' m sure he kept to himself.
Not Camille, I' m afraid.
That is the reason you sent him down the hall with his toothbrush and washcloth?
He' s out there... afraid, hoping for a miracle... that one day things will turn out all right... as long as nobody speaks ofthem.
He' s right to.
To what?
Hope?
To be afraid.
Christmas Day, twoyears ago.
We always used to spend Christmas with Maria and Paco.
Ofcourse this was before.
That' s what I understand.
I couldn' t wait to see my niece.
Camille.
Their children were special... with an extra share ofmagic... andgraceandpurity.
Henryandl were extremely fondofher.
- They seem very close.
- Don' t they?
- You too.
We were allhaving agoodtime, the way families shouldbeat Christmas.
- Red, anybody?
- No, thanks.
- You' ve already poured it out.
- He startedmaking remarks...
- Please excuse my husband. - aboutmeandPaco.
Excuse the husband, yeah.
- It was embarrassing.
I was angry.
- This the fi rst time?
- No.
ls itsomekindofsecret thatPaco finds my Chantalenchanting?
- Henry, don' t.
- So what did you do?
- Don' t what?
- I told him to shut up.
Just don' t.
Maria and I opened our presents.
- Books forme...
- Thanks. she wantedtoread... andjewelry forher thatl wantedto wear.
Why I got up when I did, I don' t know.
Unless youcallintuitionareason.
But he wasn' t there.
Something ledme toward thebedrooms.
- Yes.
He was talking, andshe was listening.
lcouldn' t tellyou whathe was saying... but the wayhe talkedtoher... was the way you talk toa woman.
lrememberhowshesmiled, thelookin hereyes.
He had no right to make her smile that way.
And you continued to stay together... each atyour own separate ends ofthe hall.
And you never had sex since?
You' re putting on quite a show for Henry, aren' tyou?
Right now, he can' t hearyou.
Once a woman decides that' s it' s not important --
Even when I would try toget things back tonormal... that image was always with me.
And sinceyou can' t have children --
Ofcourse I can.
Would you mind telling me how old you were when you and Henry met?
I think I was about 1 1 when we came over from Europe.
Henry became my father' s attorney here.
They sailed together.
He was always around.
In our families, you could always fi nd some friend ofyour father' s... with a boat in St. Thomas or a penthouse in Manhattan.
And that man was Henry.
Now, your father --
He died when you were what?
Fourteen.
And Henry becameyour surrogate father?
He paid for my college.
And that' s when you became lovers?
I wasn' t interested in boys my age.
Spring break.
I couldn' t wait.
We did it on Henry' s yacht, then in hotels... in cars, on beaches, everywhere.
He was different with me.
We had a time, Henry and I.
I can imagine.
So can you imagine his anger... at not being able to make love toyou now?
- You' ve seen it?
As in, he raped you?
Rape is an act ofanger.
It' s about control, not about sex.
Henrywas a very angry man.
Doyou think he' s guilty?
Doyou?
That night, he visited your sister' s home.
Did you notice any scratches on him, signs ofstruggle?
I can' t remember.
I need to get my hands on the clothes he was wearing that night.
Please.
Give me permission to search your house.
Becauseyou sawyour husband talking toyour niece on Christmas Eve... you' ve thrown him out ofyour bedroom and haven' t slept with him in twoyears.
Now, don' tyou think that' s a little bit harsh?
Stop trying to bait me.
What doyou call a beautiful young woman who' sjealous ofher 1 3- year- old niece?
Honest. "Honest." I don' t know who' s more fucked up, you or him.
I' m sorry.
But don' tyou want to know you' ve been right about him?
Don' tyou?
Don' t make a mess.
Take a squad ofmen.
Escort Mrs. Hearst back to her house.
Yes, sir.
- Castillo, search the house.
She tells you about Camille, everything falls into place.
There' s no need to even ask my side ofthe story.
I' mJack the Ripper, Jekyil and Hyde, big, bad wolf.
I' il remind you, Henry.
I' ve heard your story all night, and you' ve been lying.
- Detective.
- You got a problem?
- Let' s go.
Sitdown, Henry.
Going man to man now, are we?
Shall I roll up my sleeves?
You and Camille.
It was nothing, absolutelynothing.
Camille draggedmeintoherroom toshow offa Christmas gift from hermother.
- Evenaknuckleheadshouldbeable to -- - She was high onasugarrush... frompumpkinpie.
This would look good on you.
Couldn' tkeep still.
So Chantal overreacted?
Chantal never letyou touch her after that?
You know, there are many things that separate couples:
infidelity... money, long illness.
I' m separated from mywife by a hallway, a 60- foot hallway.
ln fact, it' s a desert, thathallway.
Andat the very end, there' s a door.
And when it' s locked, you can knock all you want... but thatdoor won' topen.
Whynotjustgeta divorce?
Just trade one nightmare for another.
Let' s add it up: halfmy money, the house.
I' d end up living over somebody' s reconverted garage.
Oh, yeah, and then there' s half my share ofthe law fi rm.
That' s bullshit, Henry.
It' s vanity, pure and simple.
Being with her puts you on everybody' s A- list.
"Ah!
Henry and Chantal Hearst!
They' re so in love! "
- Just full ofcompliments, aren' t we?
- That' s whyyou stay married.
At our age, fi nding anotherwoman like that' s not so easy.
Not so easy ifyou' re taking them back... toyour third- floorwalk- up piece ofshit $500- a- month studio apartment.
- Well, we can' t all afford... to wine and dine classy, sophisticated ladies we meet in La Perla, can we?
Just who' d yourwife fi nd you with before she relocated in such a hurry?
Fuckyou, Henry.
Sue Ellen Huddy.
Did you know herwell orjust in passing?
Notatall.
It' s impossible foramanmyage toknowa 12- year- oldreally well.
Throw me the bags.
Thanks.
The darkroom.
There was no dog in there.
There was onlyyou.
We don' thave any evidence ofastruggle... so it had to be somebody very good with children... or someone she knew.
Did you kick the ball around with her, Henry?
Did you laugh and play with her fi rst?
Or did youjust take her?
Was itas exciting as Paulina Valera?
- Go to hell.
You dressed her again.
You posed her.
We' il fi nd the brush you used.
And then whatyou came for:
your trophy.
Youmet Chantal whenshe was 1 1.
Youmoldedapleasure model.
ls that whatyou think childrenare for?
You peel my onion down to the nub.
Areyou trying to tell me thatyou don' t like them young?
You' re twice divorced, single with a vengeance.
Who doyou talk to in a martini bar?
The best- looking girl you can get awaywith, that' s who.
Probably mid- 30s.
Ofcourse, in their 20s -- Hey.
Now we' re talking.
And how about teenage girls?
We loved them then.
Why should anything change now?
What does he possibly see in a girl thatyoung?
What in the world do they talk about?
IfI want to discuss the S& P 500, I' il call my broker.
Young girls don' t talk.
They laugh.
They live.
They' re in the moment.
And every night is the night.
And their bodies are hard and tight... and smooth... the way skin is supposed to be.
And saying so... doesn' t make me a pervert.
Men can' t say shit anymore.
We' re all browbeaten byyouth- obsessed old bitches fresh from chemical peels.
Yes, Victor, I loveyoung women.
At least I' m honest enough to say so.
One- hundred fucking percent guilty.
We found them, sir.
- Yeah.
Put her in there.
All right, but only ifyou promise to keepyour mouth shut until I' m ready.
You' re welcome.
You can sit right here.
There should be enough tape... though I don' t think we' il need much more.
Have a seat, Henry.
She' s in there watching?
What' s he saying?
You' re good athiding behindthings.
Sitdown, Henry... andtell us onemore timeaboutyour relationship with thesecondvictim...
Sue Ellen Huddy.
Your relationship with the murdervictim, Sue Ellen Huddy -- the little girl you claim you found by thejogging path.
She thinks that I did this.
I' ilask the question onemore time.
What was your relationship to the murdered girl, Sue Ellen Huddy?
There was none.
None?
None.
I saw her by the house on occasion.
Shelivedin theneighborhood.
I might have spoke to her once or twice... ifever.
A greeting, per -- perhaps.
Here' s what I believe, Henry.
You' re bored.
You' re unhappy.
You have a history with veryyoung girls.
You' ve been placed at the scene ofthe fi rst murder.
Your attempt at an alibi was to kill a second young girl.
You' re in love with someone who doesn' t loveyou... just whoyou were.
You' re very, very lonely.
I' il tell you what I believe... whatlknow... whatlhaveproofof.
Can you tell me who that is?
Sue Ellen.
And this little girl?
Chantal was nice enough to bring these out ofyour darkroom.
Youmakelovelyphotographs, Henry.
I can' t believe that she would go these lengths...
to make this kind ofpoint.
You killed Sue Ellen Huddy.
Yes.
And Paulina Valera?
Yes.
Both ofthem?
Yes, both ofthem.
Raped and murdered them.
I' m the one.
Areyouprepared tomakeastatement?
What else am I doing?
Let' s begin with the first victim, little Paulina.

I' il be right back.
You saw her on the doorstep.
I saw her on the doorstep, and... she was allalone.

Yes. lrapedher.

They caught thekiller.
You can hold it?
Okay
Yeah, I just spoke to her Let' s go.
Where is Peter?
You killed him, didn' t you?
You killed him and you' re going to kill me.
Wow, you are making an offer.
I really enjoyed the last 24 hours. and then all cool parties.
Marvin, are you in place?
Just wait a minute, and then do it.
No, no, wait If you don' t, I won' t do it.
We' ve come so far together.
I remember I won' t tell.
I promised I won' t.
Okay, okay.
Guess what?
Right behind me.
Where is he?!
Goodbye, Mary.
Peter, Peter!
23 hours 20 minutes, Joey.
Yes, you did good, Marvin.
Wondered if I' d miss or bring this family together.
Got it.
Oh Will, don' t go.
Ann, this is about us, okay?
She seems she' s growing up so fast.
I know, I know.
It' s almost over.
Last time.
When are you going to take me for a ride?
I' ve bought the cavern of Whistler this weekend.
I did.
Okay.
Abby, are you all right?
Yes, I was just looking at crabs.
Daddy, don' t worry so much.
Yeah, don' t worry so much.
We will be fine.
Will you wiggle your wings after you take off?
You' d better watch and see.
Yes, wiggle your wings!
Wiggle your wings!
He did.
He wiggled his wings.
Okay.
Okay.
All Junk.
Do you want some icecream?
Okay
Abby, pour me the clothes all you have in there.
Karen, are you in?
Ok, you' re not there.
Listen, I got a free night tonight.
Lilly' s going to sleep over.
Call me now.
Abby, I' m ready for the clothes.
When she is nervous, I' il just have something from home.
Call us 30 from now.
Let' s go, go, go.
Are you okay?
Abby, what happened to you for having me with the laundry?
Why so loud?
She' s fine.
She' s absolutely fine.
My name is Joe.
And I' m going to help you though this thing.
Abby, where are you?
Good evening.
Oh, yes, Doctor.
May I say that several of our guests have mentioned they are much looking forward to see your presentation tonight.
Oh, it' s nice to hear.
Where is my baby?
Shut up!
Where is she?
My cousin has a celil phone.
I' d just say that you definitely look prettier than this.
Sit down!!
Look, Mrs. Jennings.
Nothing' s going to happen to Abby as long as nothing happens to me.
You can count on Marvin.
And it' s always that' s me to tell him.
What do you want?
You are a smart lady.
You pick up things really quickly.
You see what we have here is a kidnapping for ransom.
It' s a perfect kidnapping.
And I know that perfect, because I' ve done it 4 times before I caught you.
Take me to her, you son of a bitch!
I' il tell you what happened to the other 4 kids.
It' s all because I give the parents the power to keep them alive.
If you follow the rules and let me make my cost tomorrow to keep him safe
I' il call him, Karen.
If it makes you feel any better but I just going to tell you something about the gun, Okay?
You' il kill 2 people one for one.
Me and Abby.
May I?
Thanks.
It' s a quite a place you got here.
Thank you.
We' re previleged to have with us tonight a young physician I first met when he was a young Irish medical student doing research on disadaptive properties of Guiness, If I remember correctly.
Since then, I have watched him progress from intern to resident, to research scientist and finally the best of all I think you' d agree.
Ladies and gentlmen,
Dr. William Jennings.
Why won' t you let me empty our accounts and give you the money now?
I don' t think you have a backseat closet.
Another thing, it will look a little suspicious, don' t you think?
You see, unlike me, most kidnappers are morons.
They all get busted the minute they try to go for the ransom money.
They try all kinds of comlicated shit but you know, the fact the matter is, no ransom pickup is safe from the FBl.
You see the statistics from this country.
Damn, zero kidnappings for ransom was successful. and you know why?
It' s because of the ransom pickup.
That' s why I can' t go to pick up any ransom.
Is that beautiful or what?
Why can' t Abby be here right now?
Because this is a machine.
This is a machine that runs on fear.
Your fear for Abby.
And you' re ready to go.
Am I right?
Until now, position has been unable to use paralyzing alexins of that fear of fatal outcomes, all costly losses.
That day is over.
I am now adjusting the patients for the rest arrays.
Developed by myself and Bryan Adams' s pharmaceutical company, and tested in my own clinical trials at Storium Memorial Hospital in Portland,
Within seconds, this 3rd generation varied into atropine counteracts the effect of the succinic aconite restoring full nerve combatively and muscle function.
Don' t you have any feeling for the children you' re hurting?
If you can' t stand anything for 24 hours,
I won' t be still alive for years.
What are you talking about 24 hours?
All shows take exactly 24 hours.
Day' s work for day' s pay.
2 and 50 K.
Oh my god, listen to me.
No, no, no.
You listen to me Okay?
Let' s get something straight.
There are no DVAs, since no exceptions and no surprises.
She is asthmatic.
She' s severly asthmatic.
She could have attack anytime.
Let' s try.
Open the drawer you' re sitting on.
Open it!!
Shit!
Allegy, smoke, stress
Please tell me your cousin doesn' t smoke.
Does he smoke?
Shut up!
Hey, where are you?
Hey, we' re almost there.
What' s the matter?
Hey listen, listen.
Take a look at the kid.
- Give me the phone!
We got a situation here, Marvin.
You want me to take care of her?
- Not yet.
Well, it' s been over 30 seconds.
We' d better Hang up.
This is what I want you to do.
I want you to take a look at the kid and put your hand on her chest.
Is she breathing?
Hold on.
All right.
I want you to get her inside.
let her wander around, Okay?
She has a trouble breathing.
Give her strong coffee decaf and open her airways.
Yes
Just call me if there' s a problem, Okay?
You would be grateful if I helped your little girl, right?
Yes.
What?
Yes.
How would you show me?
You take me to her first.
And then I' il show you.
How to be a hooker.
Get the payment upfront!
Is that what you' re teaching at the awkward workshop?
You' d know that if you' re behind one.
We' re almost there.
She is still sleeping.
Yeah, Okay, I' il call you.
They are not there yet.
I' d like to see the bedroom.
Come on.
Hi
Can I help you?
Listen, my keycard doesn' t work.
I was wondering if I could use your phone to call the frontdesk.
You know that there' s a phone right by the elevator.
You' re right.
That must be such a rush, huh?
Just standing up there, having everybody want to be you.
A young guy with big idea and a big future
I got hot just as watching you.
I am... well, I' m so... married.
Because it' s something I' il do it... Not you.
Oh, I' m sorry, darling, but...
I don' t think it' s going to happen.
You will find some other things. You' il find 50.
Just not me.
Good night.
50 is not good to me, Doc.
'Cause Abby doesn' t have 50, daddy' s.
What did you say?
Your daughter has been kidnapped for 3 hours.
And she' s not going to live thru the night if you don' t let me in your room right now.
I' m calling to police.
If you call the cops or house, whatever you may have, it' s going to be the bullet into Abby' s brain.
If anything stops me making that phonecall, your kid is dead.
What do I have to do get my little girl back?
You know whole new world, Dr. Jennings.
Right now my partner has your wife at your house.
The little girl is being held in 3rd location.
Where?
I' m going to make a phonecall.
After that, this phone is going to ring every 30 minutes and if I don' t say things are cool
I don' t know.
I don' t know where your little girl is.
I only know she' s being held in some place the police can' t possibly get to in there 30 minutes between our phonecalls.
That' s not going to happen.
Sit down.
You skip the part of at us getting, then I' il be back.
Tomorrow morning, your wife is going to wire $250, 000 to a local bank.
You' re going to go pick up that money.
After you give it to me, your wifeand your child will be let go with inside of each other.
Oh, please.
That you simply had to add your crappy little art collection.
You got this whole thing covered, Doctor.
It' s really fucking easy.
It' s that simple.
You think I' d believe that after I' ve seen your face?
This is the 5th time we' ve done this.
Not one them reported the police.
You know why?
My partner will come back and he' il kill your child.
Marvin, is everything all right?
Fine, she' s sleeping.
I will call you.
Mommy?
Your mom is not here right now, Abby.
I am Marvin.
Where is she?
- No, I mean
Just for tonight.
Where is she?
She had to go to a party.
I want my mom.
No, it' s Okay.
It' s Okay.
No, it' s going to go by really fast.
Wait, wait,
Can you say "Marvin"?
Stop that!
I don' t like one little girl' s cry.
Hey, if you could, and you promise to not run away, you can play with her.
Hey honey, where are you?
I got him in a role.
What took you so long?
Problems.
He' s difficult.
He' s not like the other boys.
He didn' t get it.
Put him on this right now.
Okay.
Phonecall for you, Dr. Jennings.
This is Dr. Jennings.
Who is this?
You can call me Joe.
Is my wife there?
Yes, she' s right here, actually
Right here with me.
She is now starting to get the picture.
Would you like to talk to her?
Yes - Okay.
Keep it short and sweet, all right?
Will!
They took her out somewhere.
I' m going to follow them and work this out.
Where are you?
You got a beautiful bedroom, Doc.
I' ve got to tell you that the view is unbelievable.
I' m looking at a picture of Abby right now.
I don' t see you at all.
She is a spitting image of your wife, you know.
Listen, Joe.
It' s clear that we got a difficult situation.
Let me know what you need and I' il make it happen quickly and quietly.
Oh, Okay, Okay, so this is your bedside, man, right?
You talk to people like the fucking idiots and then you just go on whatever fuck you want well, let me tell you something
I am not your fucking patient, all right?
But I need you to listen.
My daughter has asthma.
Don' t need it, "my daughter".
Abby' s brain starts to die.
Look, Abby needs to be with Karen. if not that, she needs medicine.
That is going to put control back in your hands.
Back in my hands? and put my partner back on.
Hey, I' m the doctor tonight.
I' m the one who decides whether or not your girl lives or dies.
Please don' t make me prove,
And put my partner back on.
I don' t like it.
I give a shit what you' d like.
Just keep an eye on him, all right?
Who is that guy?
That' s my husband.
I wonder if he knows what is good.
Get your car keys.
Time to go.
You keep this wrap, and we' il go outside, Okay?
Here we go as fast.
And we' il get back from the ride, you' re going to watch TV.
'Cause you' ve been good.
Hey, what' s the matter?
Who does it...
What?
I get... thirsty.
That' s... gone.
Air... my chest... I can' t breathe.
My puffer.
Your what?
My medicine... I want it immediately.
They say coffee... will help?
Okay, time to put this on.
Go on, put it on your eyes.
Hang on, please.
Help me... whatever
Help me... mommy...
I' d like to hear the sound of your voice.
What do you want to talk about?
Why don' t you tell me how you met Dr. Will?
You don' t want to talk about that.
Sort of subject.
Let' s see if I can guess.
You were a nurse. and you put him through med school, and you quit and had the baby, right?
How did you know that?
I' m just an excellent judge of character.
We' re here?
Marvin will be here soon.
You are not going to be emotional. and you will not freak out.
I understand.
You' d better make sure to do because I' m going to have a gun on you every seconds.
Abby' s going to go, a little crazy when you leave.
It' s going to be tough for her to act just like the first day you go to school.
I will shoot you.
I will shoot you with her daddy' s gone.
And she' il left embarrassed for the rest of her life.
Are you Okay?
Mama' s here.
You see.
I had an attack.
- I know.
I brought the medicine right here.
Where were you?
1, 2, 3
One more time
You' re going to be fine, Okay?
Let me see, Okay.
Are you Okay?
She nearly died.
She scared me to death.
She' s fine.
She' s just a kid.
No, she is not.
She' s another little girl.
She' s some lucky little doctor' s kid.
Everything is fine, you understand me?
It sounds as the same.
It' s not the same, Marvin.
No
No?
He hasn' t hurt you?
I know you want to go home.
And I' m going to come and get you.
Put the clothes on.
Where is he keeping you?
In a cabin.
Yes
Is it far from here?
No, not that far.
No?
Does he have a gun?
No
But only if he' s nice to you.
Okay
Okay
No.
It is different the medicine is...
It' s not different.
We' ve gone over this 100, 000 times.
Back to the plan
We talk to every half an hour. and you' re still there.
Are you Okay?
Are you leaving me?
We have to, baby.
Okay, time to go, Marvin.
I' m begging you just let me see Abby till the morning.
You had some nice talking with her and that' s good for her.
Honey, you' re going to be safe
You' re going to be fine
I love you, honey!
Her medicine!
Shit!
You think you' il live in the world when your little girl' s get killed?
Put this on.
You' re one lousy, motherfucking lady.
Everybody is entitled as their one mistake.
You just made yours.
Hey, dear, put the doc on.
What are you going to do?
She got the medicine, and everything' s cool.
Where are you?
Would you put the fucking doc on?
Okay
Hey, Will, how are you doing?
I got a little news updated for you.
Here' s the little lady.
Are you Okay?
What' s happening?
I saw Abby, she had an attack.
Did you treat her... is she all right?
Just fine for now, I left her medicinea little bit.
She' s miles away from a hospital.
Oh, hey, calm down, college boy.
Tears and scream, you know how it is.
Everything' s fine now.
So listen, have fun, Okay?
You need a hanky, baby.
You, fuck!!
Jesus, what happened to you?
I' d like to wrestle with him to look after for a fun.
You didn' t get that from the fun.
That' s a beating.
And not just one.
- Oh, really?
Wow, you drive me to the battered women' s shelter?
Put it on.
Fuck you.
Are you really committed to this kidnapping?
I have a funny feeling that you' re not.
Joe just kicks out of this, but not you.
What makes you think I would ever sell him out?
Why don' t you stop pressing your smart buttons?
This is not like every other time.
'Cause Abby is sick and you' re mixed up Joe' s fucked up.
Haven' t you thought about that?
Because that' s all I' m thinking about right now.
You want me to tell you you' re going to go with me with the cost?
Who is Katie?
That' s what you called me when I was sick.
She was a little girl just like you
She is in heaven now.
Abby' s kitten in heaven.
She was my family and my friend.
She died 2 years ago.
You know, when you die you stay the same age.
She will be 6 forever.
Hey, maybe she knows your cat.
That would be kind of a coincidence.
Hey baby, we' re almost back to the house.
Is everything cool?
No, it' s not.
- What did he do?
He hit me.
I' m sorry, I lost my head.
But it won' t happen again, Okay?
What did you hit her with?
The phone.
Not hard.
You need to listen now.
What are you doing?
Oh shit, now I got blood on my phone.
Do you understand how this works?
Please don' t hurt my wife.
Likewise, asshole!
But I' m blemished.
Hey, I got a idea.
I will make you some dinner, how does that sound?
Let' s see what we got here.
You know what' s great about asthegiologist?
You don' t have to deal with pesky patients.
You got a millon phone calls. and that mails have all worked out, doesn' t it?
When he comes home, He' s got plenty of time and kickback. for a nice, romantic dinner. and this trophic wife.
I' m sorry that had to happen.
I got an idea
You got any makeup in here?
I will get you fixed up.
There you go.
Who the fuck is that?
My neighbor...
You got it?
Don' t do anything crazy.
It' s up to you.
Joan, it is very late.
You should have called.
I know it' s late.
But I' m on my way pick up Billy.
You know when I sleep over and Bill' s back, honey.
Hey, Will.
I thought you were Will.
This is...
I am Joe.
Nice to meet you.
Where' s Will?
Another conference.
I' m going to get you the disc.
I guess you should have told Joe that you have saved from the trap.
Karen and I can struggle along, I will.
We worked together in Northside General.
He means that Storium Memorial, downtown.
I was about to say Williams worked in Northside for over a year now.
No, that' s what I meant it.
Not Will' s.
So, I would appreciate it if you didn' t mention this to anyone, you know.
Of course not, I wouldn' t.
Thanks.
Hey, I' m going to open some wine.
God, Karen, do you know what you' re doing?
Where is she?
She' s upstairs.
Don' t tell anybody, Okay?
- I won' t.
I had no idea that you guys having problems.
Are you all right?
Yeah I' m fine.
You look a little frizzled.
- No, I' m fine.
I can' t talk right now.
Sometime later, Okay?
Bye Will.
- Nice to meet you.
Good night.
He' s kind of scary...
She' s still watching us through the window.
It' s going to look wrong.
Come on, keep going again.
You did good.
But you could be better.
I can swear that she was watching out there.
So you have a kid.
C- section scar.
I had an overtaking all.
Wrong kind of scar from the doctor, Sheryl.
How can you do this with a child of your own.
I mean, for god' s sake, bring this to an end.
If I should say something by myself,
You should eat.
You need strength.
Oh, god it stinks.
Let' s see what big Will has in the laundry room.
So this is sexy shirt.
This is out in the morning.
Let' s get down to business.
You guys do it and then you end up where you' re at.
Am I right?
How do you pick the families you go after?
They got to have kids of right age.
And moms have to be pretty.
And they have to be doctors, right?
Where did you get your names from?
How did you know about Northside General?
Did you work there?
Is that how you know Will?
What are you doing?
Take a look.
This is why I' m not going to have any troubles tonight.
Come here.
Does your wife know it does this part of your plan?
I can have secrets from my wife.
Let me do it in the bathroom.
You' re shy?
How could a woman looks like you be shy?
Are you Okay?
Yeah.
Just a minute.
Aren' t you tired yet?
My pills keep me up.
I' m kind of hungry.
Yeah, me too.
There' s soup and a microwave.
Oh, there' s popcorn.
We should have that to watch the movie.
Bathroom.
You scared me.
You are beautiful.
Why don' t you tell me what Will do?
Mind if we don' t talk about him?
From the looks at him,
You think you do.
I' il tell you what.
You are not like the other moms.
Close your eyes
Not an inch.
What' s that?
It' s a scalp puncher.
It will take your grip in and out so easy, you' d barely even feel it.
Jesus Christ...
Then pick up that phone, and call Marvin.
How the fuck you got the guts?
There' s no more signs. and slicing your chicken sick.
Do it!!
Take it easy, take it easy.
There' s the number.
What do you want me to say?
Tell him to take Abby and drive over here right now.
Is it ringing?
- Hang on.
Ready
Shit!
He' s not answering.
Don' t run away from me.
Don' t do it away!
No, no I swear the god.
You don' t ring the fucking number.
Where the fuck is he picking up?
I told you that not run away!
Why isn' t he answering?
How the fuck do I know?
It is with the fucking voice mail.
Hey, listen.
Where' s my daughter?
Where is my daughter, you..., Argh!
You cut me.
You fucking cut me.
Hey!
You fucking missed!
Mommy!
Where are you?
I don' t know.
In the wood, I' m way outside.
Abby, Listen to me.
Abby, listen to your mom.
Run, run as fast as you can.
Find the road, stop the car. and call 911, Okay?
Don' t let him catch you.
Mommy, I' m scared.
I' m coming in, just run, Okay?
Open the door!
Mommy!
Open the fucking door!
I' m sorry lady, she shift the runaway.
Open the fucking door!
My baby back on the phone.
You tell him to not hurt my daughter.
Tell him.
Marvin, if you hear a shot, kill the kid.
You just made a second mistake.
I need to use the bath.
He knows you from Northside.
He' s going to kill Abby.
Read that.
That' s the message from my wife.
Where is Abby, Sheryl?
You' ve done this 4 times before.
It means that I know it' s a part of the plan.
This is succinic aconite, Sheryl.
If I inject this to your body, you will be paralyzed.
You will be able to see, hear, and think, but you won' t able to move, and you won' t be able to breathe.
What the fuck are you doing, man?
Sheryl, I have seen murderers turning to a whimpering babies by this stuff.
You have a choice
Or you can find out what it feels like to die.
If I pull this trigger, you will be dead.
No
Don' t fight it, Sheryl
I know you can hear me.
You' re struggling, aren' t you?
Telling your arms to move, but they won' t.
You want to breathe, but you can' t.
It' s like living death, isn' t it, Sheryl?
Maybe your feeling' s almost as my little girl' s right now.
Or until I can bring her back.
Now, you remember what I told you.
3 and a half minutes without air, your brain is dying.
Now you' re almost there.
Remember what this feels like.
Shit
Now, where is Abby?
Where' s she?
She' s where my baby found.
Will, you killed her.
What' re you talking about?
Turn it over.
Oh, God.
Katie Yakky
Yeah, Katie Yakky
This is what he told me.
Told you what?
You know you saturated her, right?
You looked after her breathing.
You didn' t monitor her pressure.
I remember every details of Katie' s case.
She had grumes in tumor, the sergeon had difficulty trying to remove, but he couldn' t control her major argon he couldn' t control her bleeding.
He said she was barbiturated and covered
He said his operation was well.
Then he lied to you, Sheryl.
'Cause you wouldn' t think it is his fault.
This is why you chill us all.
'Cause you want a revenge.
Oh, no, you can' t get that hard.
Sheryl, you have to tell where my daughter is.
There' s an cabin at the eastern hold in Caskey.
Okay, It' s time to make the call.
You think you' re smarter than all the other moms?
No, you are not.
And now you get your daughter alive?
Waiting
It' s time.
First, you have to close your eyes.
Joe, she is my daughter.
She is my little girl.
Okay now, what you have to do... is you have to think nice thoughts.
I' m thinking about my mommy.
Yeah, that' s it.
She' s pretty.
She' s pretty and she loves you very much.
Now I want you to stay very still.
Joey?
It' s me.
You' re late, Joey.
You can' t be late.
I know, I' m sorry, I know.
Things are cool.
Just like the other times.
Just like the other times.
I' m going to follow your plan.
You don' t have to worry about me.
Did you ever think that... maybe it wasn' t about the money
That a guy like me could be motivated by something other than grip.
Hank, wake up, it' s emergency.
What happened?
My child is in danger but you can help her.
Before I tell you anything,
I don' t understand.
My daughter' s kidnapped last night
The kidnappers will kill her.
Yes.
And that you sync the phone, you wires on network, I am hoping,
I am praying the vice president of wire source can trace us the calls for me.
Can I go home now?
Go home and see your mommy.
And then we can go.
Those are the rules.
It' s fine that they always do it the same with clouds and sun for hours.
She doesn' t have good hands, you know.
They have travelled with that, but she is good.
It' s a bad day, isn' t it?
I know.
I know you have kids, Joe.
Don' t think that you know me.
Pretty smile.
It' s showtime.
We got something for you, Doctor Jennings.
The cell phone logged into a cell tower every 30 minutes
Where is it?
It' s a place called Zella, in eastern cascades
Im putting a tracing vehicle in the area
Do it, do it!
But, to do that, I' ve got to talk to somebody about what we are doing here
That means bringing in the authorities Look, I' m begging you, you can' t....
You are getting us both fucking killed...
What are you doing?
You are getting us both killed if Joey finds they are tracing his calls.
But you' ve got to explain him the truth about Katie' s death.
He' s not gonna believe a word I fuckin 'say.
He' s gonna accuse me of betraying him.
I' ve got to phone this guy back.
He' s going to call the police.
You drive.
Hey, it' s me.
Yeah, I know, I know.
We are on our way.
Ok.
We will be there.
I can tell by the look on your face you just got that call from Will.
A quarter of million dollars for a painting in cash.
I know. and he needs the money wired to the bank in Seattle by ten, otherwise the painting goes on auction.
Why don' t you call and see?
Fuck.
We got company.
Yeah?
Oh, fuck.
It doesn' t matter now, anyway.
Pull in that lot.
Pull over.
Is Abby with her?
All right.
I don' t wanna see panic.
Pull in right here.
Hey, how are you doing today?
What are you doing?
You' ve got two seconds to get in that fucking car.
Lock the door.
You see those fucking assholes?
I am a god damn genious.
See you boys.
Happy hunting.
You' ve got seventeen minutes.
Don' t make me call him.
Hello, I' m Dr. Will Jennings.
Oh yes, Dr., Mister Hibby would like to speak with you.
I' m sorry, I' m in a bit of a hush.
Just a formality.
Would you follow me please?
Hello, Dr. Jennings.
As you can see, we have your money.
I' m sorry.
I' m in a bit of a hush.
What' s the problem?
I' m special agent from the FBl.
We received a tip that your daughter has been kidnapped.
How?
Your daughter' s best chance of rescue is at the ransom exchange.
Our swat team has trained constantly in this kind of scenario.
But in order for them to do their job, they have to hear what' s going on at the drop.
Look.
Trust me.
We know what we' re doing.
Time is running up.
Better wear the wire.
All right.
What took you so long?
Excellent.
Stick in this bag.
Quick.
Yeah, yeah.
I' ve got it.
No.
What the fuck are you talking about?
I' il bring it back to the hotel.
Where is the meeting?
Don' t worry about that now.
Here' s what I want you to do.
Comercial.
You got that?
Why?
The three of us travel together.
Listen to me.
There have been complications.
No, Joey.
You don' t change the fucking plan.
You don' t break your own rules.
That' s when you get in trouble, remember that?
You don' t break your own fucking rules.
Now just shut the fuck up and do what you' re told.
God' s sake.
Not gonna hurt anybody, alright?
I got all the money.
We are fucking home free.
Let' s just fucking go.
Hurt anybody?
What are you talking about?
What makes you think I' m going to hurt anybody?
Just a cleaner exit.
Hey, I got a surprise for you baby.
Like a once in a lifetime thing.
It' s gonna be great.
Fucking great.
I' ve got to get off.
Don' t go.
I see you.
What' s going on?
You can' t pretend anymore.
You know what he' s gonna do if you don' t stop him.
I can' t.
I have to bring you back to the hotel.
He' s gonna call randomly.
I have to bring you back there.
Look, you have to convince Joey that I didn' t kill Kathie.
Listen, I' m going to help you get out of this with your money, with your conscience and with Joey.
But you have to tell him the truth about Kathie.
You have to stop him.
Marvin, it' s Sharon.
Marvin, no, listen to me.
It' s Joey who' s breaking the rules.
Joey' s gonna hurt that little girl.
He might kill her.
We have to help him.
You' re not supposed to call me.
All units.
Do not approach under any circumstances.
Look, I have an idea.
Drive me to the water front.
It' s an emergency.
This is Dr. Will Jennings.
We spoke yesterday.
Oh, yes, of course, Dr.
We' re all set up for the press conference in the main salloon.
No, it' s not about that.
Can you forward my calls?
Ah, yes.
Right.

Thank you.
We' re heading towards Zella.
It' s the only thing I want to do at this point.
Joey, is it for you or me?
It' s for me.
We can' t let him hear the plane.
Better cut the engine.
Hey there, college boy.
Just check to make sure you' re there.
Ok.
We' ve got enough altitude as long as the calls are quick.
Just a couple miles up ahead now.
I made you something.
This will be for you.

You have to set down on the highway.
Negative, that' s not an option.
We' re behind you at a chopper.
That' s too long.
You have to set down now.
Tighten your seat belt.
There' s the road.

You wanna get revenge on his ass.
While you' re at it, put some cash in them bum- ass pockets of yours.
Nah.
Nah?
You tellin 'me you ain' t tryin' to get back at the motherfuckerthat put you away?.
And at the same time, put some money in your bum- ass pockets?
Come on, man.

Mmm.

Hmm.

Yo, Ray!

[Ray]
Yo, Jakeem, over here.
Come here, man.
I gotta talk to you.
What do you want, man?
Gotta explain something to you, man.
I' m bad at explaining.
Give me a minute.
You better get good at it or I' m leaving.
Calm down.
Whats up with the animosity?.
I' il tell you right now.
It' s a long story.
And it' s gonna take a minute.
[roaring]
Ray.
Wake him up.
Wake up, bitch.
Yo.
Bitch.
Don' t worry.
Nobody sucked on you.
I remained a virgin in prison.
[chuckles]
So you two clowns are vampires, huh?
I' m the only real vampire here.
Ray is like ghetto fabulous version of Renfield or some shit.
Ever read Dracula?
So he should be pretty easy to kill.
You heard me.
You got all types of weaknessess.
Crosses.
Wooden stakes.
Silver bullets.
Holy water.
See this nigga been gettin 'his read- on in prison, huh?
Daylight.
Can' t go to somebody' s house unless you' re invited.
Matter of faot, how' d you get this place?
Bought it... with the money we got at that last job.
Rememberthat last job?
I' m about to fuck you up.
This ain' t seven years ago.
This is my spot.
What the fuck do you want from me?
What for?.
It' s not like you need any more money.
You gonna go buy a truckload of sunblock and chill at the beach?
Ha, ha.
Thats funny.
I don' t want to be a vampire no more.
And there' s this amulet and it' s in a highly guarded safe with a timer on it.
Kinda like that last job we did.
Yeah.
We all know how that tumed out.
Whats in it for me?
A whole lot of paper.
So you mean to tell me that you' re gonna pay me for a job with money that you already owe me forthe last fuckin 'job we did together!
Exaotly.
I' m offering you a lot... of dough.
Can' t get a job.
Joint, jail, job.
No.
Maybe you can even buy that little cripple bitch some rims
forfuckin 'her whole life up.
What if I don' t do it?.
I will rip out your heart and... feed it to Ray.
Like that, Ray, right?.
Nigga love heart.
I' m not stupid.
Either way you' re gonna screw me over.
So you might as well suck me dry now.
Ungh!
Oooh!
You know what, Jakeem?
Think about it.
No need to make rash decisions now.
Contemplate.
Holler at me tomorrow.
Move, nigga.
Hey!
All right.
Where you headed to?
Oh, the grocery store.
Gotta pick up some milk and eggs and stuff.
And Twinkies and doughnuts.
Yeah, yeah.
One bag of Fritos.
You can cook?.
Um...
Nah, forget it.
[chuckles]
Don' t you wish you had someone to do that for you?
I don' t need anybody' s help.
You don' t wish you were rich?
Some money would help, I guess.
You know.
Stuff like that.
What would you do if you won the lottery?.
I guess I would...
Well, definitely pay off my medical bills, you know.
Umm...
Taking a vacation sounds nice tco.
I don' t know.
You know, thats a common question.
"What would you do if you won the lottery?. '
Yeah.
I don' t have a million dollars, you know.
It' s not a big issue for me now.
I' m sorry.
What is that?.
So you can buy a lottery ticket.
- I wasn' t - - Really.
I don' t need your help.
Whats up, Jakeem?
Every time you come around here, you' re lcokin 'depressed.
That Matchbox bitch ain' t giving you no pussy?.
[coughs]
Why you keep playin ', man?
[coughs]
Are you in or oout?.
[coughs]
Come on, lets go.
Come on, man.
Fuck.
Ahh!
Lcok, man.
I didn' t come here forthis.
Okay, boss, this is a job that we gotta do in the day
'cause they' re not gonna expect us.
Especially two humans,
'cause they' re usually guarding against vampires.
One and a half humans.
Okay, you got jokes.
This is a diagram of how it' s gonna get down.
This is the front gate.
This is where the first guard is.
Afterthe first guard, there' s gonna be two more.
How we get past the first guard?
Let me finish.
Once we get past these two guards here, we head to this little room.
There might be one guard there.
I don' t know.
After we get pa -
When we get to the timer, we have about 60 seconds.
Afterthem 60 seconds, if we take tco long, it' il alert more, so you have to be quick.
How do we get past the first guard?
Tear gas.
Sounds like a fuckin 'deathtrap.
Thats what it is, man.
lf we use tear gas, the whole rest of the block is gonna swarm down on us.
Neverthought of that one.
How are you so sure that there' s three to four pecple inside?
- Possibly.
- How do you know this?
This is what I scoped out three weeks ago.
I didn' t think of that one right there.
Escape route?
The front dcor.
So there' s no escape route.
Not that I know of.
No.
[exhales]
I think you need to leave the plannin 'to me and...
- just let me be the boss.
'Cause you don' t know what the fuck you' re doin'.
Tend to your business, boss.
[sighs]
First rule... is if we walk there and the shit dcesn' t lcok right, we leave immediately.
Okay.
[clears throat]
Second rule is no guns.
What the fuck you mean, "no guns"?
How we supposed to get past fourto five guards with no guns?
Smile at 'em?
All right.
I get there and see you with a gun, I' m walkin 'away.
Okay, boss.
All right, listen.
[Ray]
Yeah, he by hisself.
This should be very easy.
So, we ready to do this?
He by hisselftco.
It' s easy like that.
It' s simple.
We distraot him and then hit him in the head with the club.
Okay, that works.
So you ready to do this?
Whats wrong with you, man?
You all right?.
I don' t need no weapon.
Yeah.
I was serious when I said no guns.
Well, dawg, I ain' t got no guns.

Good news.
Whoeverthe dumb bastard is didn' t tum it overto his master 'cause he' s still movin'.
The beacon on the amulet is still workng, so we can track him.
The security camera picked up a photo of these two clowns.
Not the brightest motherfuckers in the world.
Beautiful.

I don' t know what you' re talking about.
Whatd you tell me?
I didn' t ask you anything yet.
How do you know what I' il ask?.
My name is Cedric.
Those men you murdered, those men were mine.
That amulet you stole, that belonged to me.
Are you ready?.
I don' t know what you' re talkin 'about.
Really?.
Really?.
Why would you come into my home, steal my amulet, and kill four of my men?
- You don' t know?.
Can you give me some information?
You realize that you' re just a vampire dog?
Huh?
lf you couldn' t go out in the daylight, you' d be just as dead as my men.
Since you don' t want to tell me the story, I tell you what.
Okay.
I used to pitch forthe triple A.
A hundred- mile- an- hourfastball.
Kinda defines me.
Straightforward and hard.
So now we' re gonna play a game.
You ready?.
Get my shit.
Get my shit.
Now we' re gonna play a game.
You know what the game is?
Three strikes and Jakeem tells me all I wanna know.

So what are we sayin '?
Yeah!
Yeah!
Check this out.

"Rappin" '?
Gimme the ball.
What ball?
Give me the ball.
The amulet.
Thats first.
But as far as information, this vampire dog dcesn' t wanna give us any.
We' re just gettin 'friendly, right?.
I told you I don' t know what you' re talking about.
Bullshit.
Yeah, I did steal the amulet.
You had choices, Jakeem.
They were all bad, but you had choices.
Do you have any idea the powerthis amulet has?
Do you have any idea what would have happened had Khalil got his hands on it?.
He would have been invincible to everything we have, including daylight.
Or do vampire flunkies like you even care?
- Some shit funny?.
- Whats funny?.
You' re a bunch of stupid motherfuckers.
Why the fuck do you keep that amulet around?
Huh?
So some evil mastermind can steal the shit?.
And take overthe world?
Oh, wait, wait.
Are y' all vampires?
Do we lcok like motherfuckin 'vampires?
I think you need to let me go.
Lets go.
Come on.
Lets go, Ced.
See you next season.
You better run as scon as you let them shits go.
All right, bitch.

Jakeem!
You don' t know who I' m talking aboout?.
You don' t know?.
Jakeem!
You don' t know who I' m talking aboout?.
You don' t know, huh?
How many other motherfuckers push you around the street?.
Yeah!
Cry, bitch!
Cry!

Wco, woo, woo!
Whats up, kid?
Whats wrong?
What do you want, man?

Every time I see you, you have a fuckin 'attitude.
What the fuck do you waht?.
Nothin '.
I thought you wanted to see your girl again.
What you mean?
You know they tcok her, right?.
I don' t know.
I just said they tcok her.
I told you I don' t know where she' s at, man.
The only way you' re gonna get her back is in exchange forthe amulet.
I don' t have the amulet anymore.
Then you better get it back.
No, you bettertell me where the fuck she' s at.
Hold this.
You' re all just a bunch of motherfuckin 'cowboys, huh?
Blastin 'pecple on the street in broad daylight.
Whats up with that shit?.
Lcok, sorry we used you as bait, but it' s procedure.
Period.
I don' t want herto get hurt.
- Lets go, Ced.
- Lets get out of here.
You all gotta let me come.
No way.
No civilians on my team.
Come on.
It makes sense.
You get wounded in there ortum into one of them freaks, thats it for me.
You' re suing us for something that dcesn' t even make sense.
Shit, not to mention what happened to that cat, Clay Van Helsing.
They got him for 2. 5 million just for mentioning the Stake Prty.
No way we bring this civilian.
Lcok, but I can be a decoy or something.
[Cedric]
Yo, listen.
No way.
I come by myself, he thinks I have the amulet and then you can ambush him.
You know what happened to -
Leave everybody, you know, happy, safe.
- And - - Use me as a shield.
lf you interrupt me one more time, you won' t make it out this basement.
Wait a minute.
He has a point.
See?
I should' ve aced you when I had -
But you didn' t.
Lets go.

Don' t tum your back on me inside the house, baby.

Summertime... vacation time
Among the vacationists was a Woman of the City.
Several weeks had passed since her coming and still she lingered.

"Tell me!
You are all mine? "
"Sell your farm... come with me to the City."
"... and my wife?"
"Couldn' t she get
"Couldn' t she get drowned?
"... then overturn the boat... it will look like an accident."
"Leave this behind... come to the City!"
"COME TO THE ClTY!"
"... after the boat has capsized, save yourself with these bulrushes."
"The rushes will hold you up.
Scatter them before you reach the shore and tell everyone she drowned by accident. "
"We' re going for a trip across the water.
I may not be back for quite a while. "
"Don' t be afraid of me!"

Detective Sipowicz, tell the court how you arrested Mr. Giardella.
This past August 27, I was surveilling the defendant, as he is a known felon.
During the surveillance I observed the defendant' s car having a flat tire.
He got out and opened the trunk.
I approached the car, identified myself as a police officer...... and through casual observation I saw 27 cartons of cigarettes...... which did not have tax stamps.
I ascertained it was his car, gave him his rights and took him into custody.
- Nothing further, Your Honor.
Detective Sipowicz...
... you testified that the cigarettes for which you arrested my client...... were in plain sight in his trunk when he opened it to get out a jack?
- Right.
- Now...... there were seven nails in Mr. Giardella' s right rear radial.
That wouldn' t exactly produce a slow leak.
Yet you say, during several hours of antecedent surveillance...... you saw no one damage his tire.
I was surveilling Mr. Giardella, not his car.
He stopped at Niglio' s Coffeehouse.
Maybe some urban youths did mischief to his vehicle during that time frame.
Your Honor, justified or not...... the reputation of the neighborhood around Niglio' s Coffeehouse...... is such that urban youths do not tend to do mischief in its environs.
Maybe he drove past a construction site.
However, Sipowicz here has a vendetta against Mr. Giardella.
I submit the true scenario is that while my client stopped at Niglio' s...... Sipowicz hammered nails into his tire to cause a flat...... so when Mr. Giardella stopped to get out a spare...... he could circumvent probable- cause statutes...... and go fishing inside Mr. Giardella' s trunk.
Move to suppress the evidence as tainted and dismiss the complaint.
Granted.
- And the construction- site theory?
Adjourned.
KELLY:
GlARDELLA:
Meanwhile, I' m walking out the door.
You clear $90 a day?
Here, go buy some clean socks.
- Come on.
Lay off.
- No, that hump rubs me the wrong way.
- I' il make his life miserable.
- And bury your career.
- They already held that service, John.
Andy....
Ms. District Attorney, you prosecuted the crap out of that one.
- I went with the crap I had.
- Are you saying I queered his tire?
I' d say, "Res ipsa loquitur," if I thought you knew what it meant.
Hey, "ipsa" this, you pissy little bitch.
KELLY:
He' s on an errand.
My office.
I heard he flipped out in court.
You need to think about a new partner.
Lieutenant, I know Sipowicz is messing up, but he' s gonna come out of it.
I realize how you feel about him.
Both of us know where he is.
And it' s not running an errand.
He' s at Patrick' s, getting loaded.
Andy was a great cop.
Now he' s a drunk that won' t help himself.
- I' m taking him off the street.
- Don' t do that yet.
Let me talk to him.
Let me see if I can shake him up.
That asshole, Giardella.
He can wear all the $1 000 suits he wants, I' m not impressed.
I popped him when he rolled drunks in the park, and he knows I did.
- You know where he' s gonna be tonight?
- The best table at Gianinni' s.
You' re damn right.
Telling a broad how his lawyer made me look like a jerk.
Leon, hurt me twice.
This has gotta stop, Andy.
- What' s gotta stop?
- You' re getting stiff every afternoon.
I don' t recall requesting any career counseling from you.
When was the last time you tried going on the wagon?
When was the last time you tried growing tits?
- Let' s talk in the morning.
- No, let' s talk now.
I think we should call it quits.
- Meaning what?
- Meaning us being partners.
Yeah, sure.
Get bored at home, you dump your wife.
Problems at work, dump your partner.
I didn' t dump her, she dumped me.
And secondly, I' ve been carrying you.
We both know it.
Every cop in the station knows it.
And I' m sick of it.
All right, you wanna split up?
That' s no problem.
That' s no problem at all.
- Get your hands off of me!
- Let' s go somewhere....
Get your hands off of me!
- Let' s go get something to eat.
I' m on rug patrol tonight.
- Andy, come here.
- Get away from me.
Or so help me, I' il clean your clock.
LEON:
Yeah, sure.
- Hey, Ramon.
- Hi, detective.
She just went in.
- What' s with the shiner?
- Punks jumped me in the basement.
- Anybody report it?
- What am I gonna report?
I just gave them the $46.
If you don' t report it, I can' t do anything about it.
I' il send a sector car over.
You should move back into the building.
- I brought dinner.
- Where' s the separation forms, Johnny?
You know what?
I lost them.
You lost them?
- I looked all over.
We' il use yours.
- We each need to fill out assets.
I lost a form, Laura.
You want me to hang myself?
So am I dismissed?
Do I get pizza?
- Ramon got mugged in the laundry room?
- Last Tuesday.
- When was I gonna hear about it?
- I just found out yesterday.
- Don' t go down there at night.
- I' ve been going to the laundromat.
How' s work?
You' il let them put up that building?
- We' re still negotiating the variance.
- Thank you.
- "How' s work, John?"
- I' d ask if I wanted to know.
We are splitting up.
You do not have to hate the job anymore, okay?
Just because we' re splitting doesn' t mean I' il stop worrying about you.
Good.
Hey, come here.
- Sure we' re doing the right thing?
- I' m sure.
A lot of people stay together behind less than what we got going.
That' s not good enough.
I don' t wanna have this conversation every time you get horny.
My mistake.
I just think it would be easier... -... if we made a clean break.
- We both have feelings for each other.
- Right.
So I think it would be easier if we just left each other alone.
Lot of good this is going to do.
You' re an easy guy to find, Alfonse.
Thursdays at Gianinni' s.
- What are you doing here?
- Am I interrupting?
Was AI telling you about the Marino family?
You' re crossing a line here.
Move away.
What is that, a threat?
Look around.
You can' t afford anything in here.
Go home.
- Stand up.
Are you crazy?
- Shut your mouth.
- Are you nuts?
All right, Mr. Wig says:
"Alfonse has to go outside now."
Come on.
Come on, let' s go.
You son of a bi --!
Alfonse, are you okay?
All right.
All right, let' s see.
Is this your money?
Here' s your money.
Is this the hundred you offered me in court?
Eat it!
You' re a damn psycho, Sipowicz.
You need some time in the country.
Here, you big ape.
You want some dessert?
Have a sock for dessert.
Have one of the socks I can' t afford to change.
That need something to spice it up?
Maybe a dash of wig?
Here, go on.
How' s that?
You think you' re better than me?
- Laugh at me now, you dickhead.
Get off him!
You get out of here!
Breathe deep!
Enjoy yourself!
You just made the worst mistake of your life!
- What is the matter with you?
What' s the matter with you?
- What' s the matter with you?
- Stop following me....
- What' s going on, detective?
- It' s over.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I' m all right.
Make sure he gets home.
He' s a cop.
You all right?
Yeah, yeah.
LlCALSl:
Yeah?
- Weren' t you with the 116 in Queens?
- Yeah, until last month.
Who do I call to get attention on a building?
KELLY:
Got a piece of paper?
This is my wife -- Ex- wife' s address.
- There was a robbery in the basement.
- I' il have the sector car watch it.
Appreciate it.
I didn' t realize you were getting a divorce.
I' m just getting it done.
- That' s too bad.
- Yeah.
Anyway, thanks a lot.
- Who called the rat squad?
Something to do with your partner feeding Giardella his wig last night.
- The owner filed a complaint.
- Where' s Sipowicz?
- Men' s room.
They' re gonna want your statement too.
Here, open this for me.
- You get home all right?
- Yeah.
- You see lnternal Affairs outside?
- Yeah.
- I' m screwed.
- Not off the statement I' il give them.
No, they got me.
What you said yesterday, I can' t disagree.
I' ve been holding you down, making you look bad.
That' s not the point.
You stop drinking, you get a little help --
You get to a point, the hand' s been dealt and played.
- Still friends though, right?
- Come on.
Still friends.
I. A. D. prefers you and Detective Sipowicz don' t confer.
You ready, detective?
Yeah.
So, what happened?
Was it as bad as the club owner said?
- I didn' t see very much, lieutenant.
- I' m not pairing you with anybody yet.
You need a body, use the kid in Anticrime, Martinez.
- You got a visitor, detective.
- Detective Kelly, I' m Josh Goldstein.
- I know you.
- Apartment 4B in your old building.
Was there another robbery?
No, but I did notice some suspicious characters in the lobby.
No, I' m an attorney.
Laura asked me to provide some documents... -... which we' il file.
- We weren' t using lawyers.
I' m not being compensated.
She felt it' d go smoother if I' m a go- between.
Sometimes we tend to get sidetracked.
Well, if you' il fill these out, we can meet this afternoon.
- How come you got a gun?
- Gun?
Yeah, in your briefcase.
You got a permit?
With everything going on in the building --
So that' s a no on the permit?
Please don' t arrest me.
I' d be disbarred.
It' d kill my parents.
It' s okay.
Get the permit.
- I take these to the city clerk?
- Yeah, we can meet this afternoon.
- Is 3: 00 all right?
- 3: 00.
Your wife wanted me to assure you there' s no deepening of animosity --
- What' s she cooking for you?
- Excuse me?
Well, if she' s not paying you, she' s cooking for you.
We agreed on three dinners in lieu of compensation.
- Quite a bargain.
What' s on the menu?
- I' il happily take potluck.
Okay, 3: 00, city clerk' s office.
Name' s Martinez, detective.
I heard a lot about you.
Anyways, I can help.
I don' t know what you heard, but this is a temporary assignment.
I can work with that.
I. A. D. OFFlCER: lnitial to decline legal and union representation...... while you were giving this statement.
You should consider yourself on modified assignment.
Your salary will continue.
You' il be notified of further disciplinary action.
I' il need your gun and shield.
Stay away.
Line them up, Leon.
- Hi, Andy.
- Come on, line them up.
All right, come on, let' s go.
They' re killing me, Lois.
- I know, baby.
They sit there staring at you, make you explain everything.
They' ve never been on the streets in their lives.
- Maybe I should take a shower.
- No, later.
After.
They try to make you feel like two cents.
Come on, baby.
Come to mama.
Hey, fat ass.
You' re a creature of habit too.
Yours is gonna make you dead.
- I' m sorry, Andy.
- I hope you got paid a lot.
- Wait, you gotta let me get out.
Good job.
I' m sorry, Andy.
She' s got people in Orlando.
Thinks she' s moving there.
- She gonna work Disney World?
- Say something smarter than that.
- You' il be dead a long time.
- I' d rather be dead...... than have that mop on my head.
Hey, private club.
- Kiss my ass.
He' s got a badge, Mr. Marino.
You know where Alfonse Giardella is?
- No.
- Did you know he shot a cop?
You didn' t know, did you?
He works for you and didn' t get your permission, did he?
Who raised you to have such a big mouth?
KELLY:
Yeah.
Tell Giardella that John Kelly wants to see him.
- No hands.
- John Kelly.
Sipowicz' s condition is extremely critical.
He' s bleeding too badly for them to finish operating.
The front desk will have word of any change.
We' re coordinating with Port Authority P. D...... monitoring all bus, rail and air terminals for the prostitute.
Meadows and Wong are canvassing a neighborhood for any witnesses.
Sager and French are on Patrick' s Bar.
I' m handling forensics.
You' re all green- lighted for any necessary overtime.
This is lnspector Lastarza of the Organized Crime Unit.
Gentlemen, ladies, be assured that as you investigate this shooting...... you will receive any intelligence and assistance my force can provide.
Since task- force operations are ongoing and involve individuals...... who will fall within your investigation...... it' s imperative you notify us of your activities.
A costly incident has just occurred as a result of a failure to so notify.
I urge you all to avoid a repetition.
Good luck.
See me.
- You killed a surveillance mike.
- Where?
At the social club, doing your John Wayne act for Marino.
- I put a guy off me.
- Yeah, into the thermostat...... and our mike, which is no longer transmitting.
My partner got shot.
I could care about your mike.
I' m hooked into this crime family.
I' ve got two years and 20, 000 man- hours on the line.
I' m not gonna jeopardize that for one victim...... cop or no cop, partner or no partner.
Your officer' s emotionally involved.
He' s out of policy.
He' s got no business anywhere near this case.
- Is he right?
- That I' m emotionally involved?
Yeah.
- No, about you being out of control?
- Where' s this going?
Sit down and make a list of possible suspects.
- People he busted, pissed off.
- That' s a waste of time.
So is looking for Lois.
She' s out of town or out of air.
Are you gonna do what I ask?
You want a suspect list, lieutenant?
You got one.
- Your wife' s downstairs.
I blew that 3: 00.
- This is inconsiderate, even for you.
- It' s two subway rides for us.
KELLY:
Yeah, I' m sorry.
You inconvenienced us.
- Are you done impressing her?
- He' s helping us, so lose the macho --
- Andy got shot a couple hours ago.
- Oh, my God.
Okay?
- Yeah.
- If you go to the hospital -- - He might not live that long.
If you want someone to ride over with or just get a beer...?
I' il let you know.
Your list of suspects.
- Is this a joke?
One name?
Alfonse Giardella set him up and shot him.
There are no other suspects.
You wanna get in some trouble?
- I' m up for that.
- I gotta go.
- Come on.
Hey....
Everyone, zip up, wipe their hands off and get against the wall.
- That' s it, come on.
Thank him.
Call him when you wanna be bailed out.
Thank him for the bust.
Delivery.
Post time.
You are under arrest.
Get against the wall.
Tell Marino you got popped...... because he can' t control his people.
Spread.
Waste your time, running like that.
You' re never gonna get away from me.
Martinez, you' ve got moves out there.
- I escaped a lot as a youth.
- Come here, Kelly.
What are you doing?
- Bleeding Marino to give up Giardella.
- If he gives him up dead?
That' s okay too.
I have four messages from Lastarza.
I won' t be able to protect you.
I understand.
Officer Licalsi.
- You wanna get that beer?
- Sure.
Here you go.
- Was Sipowicz your first partner?
- Since I got my shield.
He' s tough, huh?
He' s still hanging on.
I' ve been afraid to go over there.
- My dad died there when I was a kid.
- How' d he die?
- Oh.
Went through the wrong door.
I' m sorry.
My dad' s a cop too.
- Oh, yeah?
The 27.
- My folks live in Staten lsland now.
- They must be proud of you.
Hope so.
You didn' t have to be at the hospital.
You were with Sipowicz when it mattered.
I don' t know.
We got into a beef right before he went after Giardella.
I halfway think that' s why he did it.
I know that' s not why he got shot.
It just seems that no matter how much you feel about someone...... you never really get it squared away.
You never really get to understand them the way you wanted.
Is that how it was with your wife?
No, she blamed the job.
Said I was in the street too much.
Maybe she didn' t meet you halfway.
Maybe she didn' t know how to listen.
Probably enough blame to go around there, right?
You wanna get some dinner?
What do you wanna be doing in a couple of years?
What you' re doing now.
I want my shield.
I heard you got yours at 28.
Yep, I was lucky.
So, what do we do now?
That depends on you.
- You' re up- front.
- I don' t count on second chances.
Am I weird if I' m not really sure what I wanna do?
- You' re not weird.
- I never cheated when I was married.
- Really?
- That' s right.
Well, why don' t we just play it by ear?
Where are we playing?
- Oh, you are here.
- Your phone' s off the hook.
- Is that right?
- Is there any news about Andy?
- No, he' s the same.
Sorry I messed up on the papers.
No, that' s the last thing you should' ve been thinking about.
Can I come in?
I got some company.
Well, you' re all broken up about Andy, aren' t you, John?
Let' s do what we came here to do.
I' m counsel to Alfonse Giardella.
He' s wanted for questioning in the Sipowicz shooting.
He rousts me, and I' m harassed when he' s whacked.
- He ain' t dead yet.
- I don' t give a damn about your buddy.
- I was playing cards.
- He here for a statement?
- That' s right.
- Interview one.
Come on, come on.
I know what you' re trying to do, and it' s not gonna work.
What I think would be useful is if maybe you traced your activities... -... starting 8: 00 yesterday morning.
- I' m gonna trace myself.
I just wanna tell this douche bag he' s barking up the wrong tree.
Sit down, fatso.
I was on my way to Atlantic City.
I got a condo there.
I arrived and went to several casinos, where I lost money at blackjack.
It' s all on the cameras.
Check it out.
Back at my condo, I got a call that you were looking for me.
This was maybe 9: 00 last night, and I drove back up this morning.
- Questions, gentlemen?
Yeah.
When did you get to the casino yesterday?
- About 4: 00.
- That' s three hours after he was shot.
That' s when I arrived.
He' s suddenly talking?
He' s making accusations?
I was accompanied the whole drive.
People can testify to that.
I don' t care what he says in his mind.
Screw him.
And screw you guys.
None of this is gonna work.
Angelo Marino trusts me.
KELLY:
For what?
This crackdown of yours has made my year.
My card, if you need to be in touch.
Shove it, counselor.
Take the card.
Look at the address on the back.
It' s a restaurant I recommend.
Hey, Jimmy, come on, let' s go!
Your party' s here, Mr. Marino.
Excuse me, I gotta look for a wire.
Pager unit.
It' s okay, Lou.
KELLY:
Enjoy your meal.
- You want something to eat, drink?
- No.
- This crap in the street has to stop.
- Give me Giardella.
We' re not talking about Alfonse Giardella.
I' il take care of it myself.
We' re talking about you and me.
I' m sitting here politely.
I' m offering you a meal.
And I' m telling you, either cut this out or we got a serious problem.
- He whacked my partner and I want him.
- The problem' s mine to take care of.
Now, sometimes people get justice without getting time.
Not good enough!
You punk.
You' re gonna tell me what' s good enough?
You' re gonna tell me how to run my business and embarrass me in public?
- You think you can' t get hurt?
- You know what to do.
- You gonna keep this up, aren' t you?
- Till he' s mine.
This thing' s going off.
What happened?
I was on my way home.
Your ex- wife, she' s fine.
She knows who got mugged.
He didn' t want to give up his wallet.
LAURA:
Watch it.
I' m on the job.
Give me the description of this guy.
You okay, 4B?
Yeah.
Guess as a fighter, I make a great lawyer.
- My nose broken?
- I wouldn' t be surprised.
This is an excuse to get it fixed.
- No, that' s really not necessary.
- You see anything?
- No, not until he came in the door.
Maybe you go over to your mother' s until I get this guy.
I didn' t have a right to do that last night or talk to you like that.
- It' s all right.
- It isn' t.
You have a right to have company the same way I do.
- We' il feel our way through it.
I' m gonna go to the hospital.
- Where are they taking him?
- Queens General.
- Nothing new on Andy?
Take care of yourself, all right?
See you, John.
- She' s okay?
- Yeah.
- Hey, thanks for stopping.
- No problem.
What about us?
We' re fine.
Okay.
- Take care, all right?
- I will.
Mr. Marino, you wanted to see me?
This guy won' t hear reason.
Is that your impression...... that Kelly won' t back off?
I' m not sure.
He' s upset about his partner.
Not sure?
You' re screwing the guy and you' re not sure?
All right.
I want you to kill him.
- How am I gonna do that?
- You' re a cop.
You' il figure something out.
I' m sorry I didn' t get here till now, buddy.
I had a bad experience here, you know.
My dad and....
You know about that.
I don' t know --
I don' t know if you can hear me or what, I don' t know.
I don' t know what' s going on in your head.
But, um....
But I' m sorry.
I just....
I' m grateful for the way you treated me...... on coming up and....
You' re like a father to me, man.
And if this is goodbye....
I came to tell you that you' re the toughest bastard I ever met...... and I' m not counting you out.
I' m not counting you out.
Andy?

That woman really wanted to hurt my baby in the bus station!
Every happening has its own reason
If you never do something bad for other people (have been translated) you shouldn`t care about something strange
Why i must take this bad result?
I have never hurt others
Why treat me just like this? everything can be brought by heart
I think you always avoid something
Only you know what you avoid (already been translated) who is she? who is she on earth??
Get out!!
Get out!!
Get out!!

Billy was a former prostitue out of east Berlin, had a reputation for being the dirtiest fighter in the ranks.
Didn' t seem to matter to her that something like that could kill a person and the crowds loved her.
He turned her down without even telling her.
The next was to fight, the british champ, the jamaican girl billy just beat.
Hello?
Not interested.
He turned that down too.
That' s a lot of money boss.
Your making money what are you still working here for?
It' s a title match right?
Are you british?
It' s a title you can' t take away, she' s got nothing to lose, you got nothing to win.
Might still be a good fight.
I just brought you up to welter weight, too good to fight these contenders, you' d rather fight some bullshit champ.
Didn' t notice i was fighting any contenders.
Well you can get yourself another manager anytime you want.
Frankly i' d learn to protect your face a lil better wouldn' t have to turn down this money.
My face out there so much, it' s a miracle i haven' t been knocked out yet boss.
You can' t work here anymore tonight, i made us a reservation, you uh, might wanna shower.
Here you go, here YOU go.
Well it aint no big secret (...) for.
Go ahead and blow em.
Thank you.
33 aint so old, I was still fighting the 39, fought for 23 years.
How' s it going scrap?
Doing good nicky, doing good. what' il ya have?
Coffee.
You do not speaketh?
Don' t hardly know him.
When i met frankie, right after my 37th birthday he was picking up cut work, he used to patch me up when i thought it was impossible, good man to have in the corner.
Yes he is.
He stayed with me through my last fight in san bernadino too.
My manager was off getting drunk somewhere,
It' s just frankie and me.
I was taking a hilacious beating.
Everybody gots a particular number of fights in em,
Nobody tells you what that number is.
Mine was 109, i just didn' t want to admit it.
Both rounds cut opens up, blood starts pouring into my eye, they should have stopped the fight, but hell i was black man in san bernadino, blood was what i was there for, round after round, i kept getting frankie to patch me up, he' s talking bout throwing in the towel, but he aint my manager he can' t throw in nothing, round after round he' s arguing with me, i' m almost laughing cause (...) more to him than to me.
I go 15 rounds lose by decision, next morning i lose the eye.
In 23years he' s never said a thing about it.
Doesn' t have to, i see it in his face everytime he looks at me, somehow frankie thinks he should have stopped that fight, should have saved my eye, it' s been his life wishing he could take back the 109th fight, i wanted to go to 110, thing is, if you want to get to the title, maybe he' s not the one to take you there.
YOu tells mack i' d be here tonight?
You go on and eat your cupcake.
It' s the rule, always protect yourself,
People never take their own advice, if she was gonna leave frankie, better she did it to him then.
Mr micky mack, i' m maggie fitzgerald, i hear your a real good manager doing good things for big Willie, but i' d thought you should know i aint never leaving mr dunn, so you dont need to make anymore excuses to bump into me, sorry for interrupting your dinner.
Maggie always did like taking em out in the first round.
The letters always came back marked the same way, "return to sender".
OH i' il make ya some coffee.
What are you doing with your money?
Saving it.
Good girl.
You know you save enough of it you get yourself a new house, cash no mortgage.
It' il be a while before i can do that.
Yeah well it might be a stretch but, you got to get yourself a place of your own.
Go around wasting it on things that don' t matter and what you got?
Understand?
(...) wait long enough, you got nothing.
Ok, as soon as i get the money.
I' ve made a lot of mistakes in my life, i' m just trying to keep you from doing the same.
I know boss.
I' m not gonna live forever.
What is it?
It' s a tape on that girl in england your gonna fight.
Hey get the hell down, know how old i am?
Thank you boss, thank you so much.
Here just let me put this in the machine.
What machine?
You dont have a tv huh?
No.
10 minutes love.
Thank you, (...) says he loves me.
Oh he' s probably not the first one to say that.
First since my daddy. i win you Think he' il propose?
You win, i' il propose.
Look i got you a gift here.
NO no this is it.
What' s it mean?
I dont know, just something in galac.
It' s beautiful.
Ya i thought so, Real silk thread.
She wasn' t the main attraction, she was only under card to the middle weight title fight.
But ask someone who was there, and they couldn' t tell you who else fought that night.
She' s tough,
I can' t go inside, i can' t get close enough to hit her.
You know why that is?
Why?
Cause she' s a better fighter than you are that' s why, she' s younger, she' s stronger, and shes more experienced, now what are you gonna do about it?
Get in.
I could ask someone you know?
Good, you find out you let me know.
Maggie fought in edinbourough, in paris, brussels, and amsterdam, it was always molkusha.
Seems there' s irish people everywhere or people that want to be.
By the time they came back to the states, maggie was in a whole new league.
After that they got another offer to fight for the title.
What' s the split?
60/ 40.
Good we' il take 60 and you take 40, beeing as maggie' s the draw.
Ugh, that little girl?
You think i' m wrong really?
You think people are saying that they want to see some scabby crout beat up on little miss what' s her name?
YOu find someone that says that and we' il take the 40, (avita cest)
Well there at 60/ 40 but they' il come up to 50/ 50.
How' s that girl doing?
She' s got a concusion, broken ear drum. she be alright?
And if she isn' t?
Maybe i should send her something.
You could send her your check if you' d like, i' m sure she' d take it.
Boss? that lil house we talked bout, I bought it.
Well smart girl.
It' s only about a mile from where she lives now, no mortgage just like you said.
Your a good daughter.
She dont know about it yet.
I was hoping maybe we could stay an extra day, drive over there, i know she wants to meet you.
Yeah, we could do that.

You should have asked me first.

Momma i' d send you money.

Why didn' t you just give me the money?
Why' d you have to buy me a house?
Didn' t have to momma, but it' s yours, you want the money? sell it.

Sure momma.
I' il try to keep the house, just worry about all those expenses.
I' il send ya some more money.
That man hitting you?
It' s from the fight, i' m a fighter momma.
Find a man marianne, live proper, people hear about what your doing and they laugh.
Hurts me to tell you but, they laugh at you.
You ever own a dog?
Nope, closest i ever came was a middle weight from bardstown.
My daddy had a german shephard, axl, axl' s hind quarters were so bad he had to drag himself room to room by his front legs, me, me and mardel bust up laughing watching him scoop across the kitchen floor.
Daddy, he so sick by then he couldn' t hardly stand himself, but one morning he got up, carried axl into his rig and the two of them went off into the woods singing and howling, but wasn' t til he got home that night alone, that i saw the shovel in the back of the truck.
Sure miss watching the 2 of them together.
I got nobody but you Frankie.
Well you' ve got me.
At least that is, until we find you a good manager.
Hey, can we stop just up here?
This place has the best lemon pie around, none of that can filling crap.
Now I can die and go to heaven.
I used to come here with daddy.
I wonder if a place like this is for sale, I got a little bit of savings.
That' s fine, fine thanks.

Would you rather fly, or would you rather drive?
So I finally get to decide something?
That' s what i' m saying.

Ladies and gentlemen this is the feature presentation of the evening, in this corner, the challenger Maggie Fitzgerald in the red corner, in the blue corner the wba welter champion of the world, billy the blue bear.
Sweet Jesus.
Alright that' s it, i' m gonna take away a point, 1 point deduction off the blue corner.
Ladies and gentlemen the first round is in the books on this championship match.
Looking good.
You pull that crap one more time your disqualified.
It' s gonna be alright.
Got no doubt boss.
Just watch yourself, stay away from her.
Go to the neutral corner, neutral corner.
Stay down you bitch.
I got it, i got it.
How' s the blood boss?
HOw many eyes do you need to finish this fight?
One' s enough.
(...) stepping to the outside and hooking the liver?
I' ve been doing that, she' s waiting to steal.
I know but i dont want you to go to the liver this time, i want you to heel, right up under her skinny ass, understand?
Right in the cianic nerve, just keep digging it in there, digging it in, and just keep sticking her, you hear that?
What about the ref?
Just keep yourself between the ref and the bear and things' il just be fine.
This is yours, keep your guard up, keep it up.
C' mon breathe, that' s it, breathe, good....
HOw you feeling darling?
I wanna beard boss.
I thought it might help me with the ladies.
Can' t say it does.
Does it, does it hurt much?
That' s good.
Where' s Frankie?
He' s uh, he' s out there talking to the doctors, probably telling them how to do their job.
There telling em i' m a C1 and C2 complete, means my spinal cord is still broken never be able to breathe easy.
That i' il be frozen like this for the rest of my life.
I asked them to tell him, i dont know how' s he gonna take it.
Did you see the fight?
YOu had her cold maggie.
I should' nt have dropped my hands, i shouldn' t have turned,
always protect myself how many times he would tell me that.
Yeah he does like to repeat himself.
Well you tell him, i' m real sorry.
No, i wont do no such thing maggie.
Damnest thing, so what' s the plan, i know you got one, so you might as well tell me what it is?
It' s your fault, yeah it' s your fault she' s lying in there like that, you kept after me until i trained her, i knew i shouldn' t have done it, her being a girl and all everything kept telling me not to, everything but you.
I' m gonna get you outta here, doctors around here dont know squat, why would they be living here out in the desert, as soon as you' il be able to be moved, find some place where they actually studied medicine, you just rest there and i' m on it.
Frankie must have called every hospital in america looking for somebody who would tell him they could fix her, came close twice, til they checked her over said there was nothing to be done, took 2 months til she was stable enough to move.
They got nurses for that you know.
The' re amateurs.
She developed skin (...) cause she couldn' t change positions.
Thank you.
It made the 6th (...) trip by ambulance.
Fly there, drive back.
The rehab center Frankie found was a nice place, they took good care of Maggie she would have complained if they hadn' t.
Took her several hours everyday to get her ready for the wheel chair.
Since she couldn' t breathe on her own, the resperators were always on, oxygen was pumped in her 24hours a day.
Maggie' s momma called to say they were all coming for a visit, she waited by the window everyday for the next 2 weeks.
Frankie finally tracked them down, learned they checked into their hotel 6 days earlier, kept leaving messages which were never returned.
You dont have to hang around all day.
No, I like it here, i dont mind, fact if you weren' t here i' d come here anyway to read my books.
Momma' il be here soon to share some of the burden.
Oh it' s no burden, here read this.
Ok ok that' s enough, that' s terrible.
But anyway i' il tell ya in english what your saying, it says that "i will arise and go now, and go to in its free, in a small cabin built there of clay and waddles made, and i shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow, dropping from the vales of the morning to where the crickets sings.
Not bad huh?
You gonna build a cabin boss?
Me?
Yeah, you know when you quit all this.
You mean boxing?
No i' il never quit,
like the stink too much i guess.
You think? cause i could see you there real easy with your books and lemon pie.
How about you would you like to go live in a cabin?
I could learn how to bake.
Ya well then i' il maybe i' il start looking then.
Hi i' m Frankie Dunn, i met you back out in Missouri. where' s my little girl?
Well don' t you think you oughta go back to the hotel and change, she doesn' t know you' ve been here a week visiting woody and mickey.
We got business with my sister, why dont you tell us where she is?
Well you must be JD and you must be the business guy,
look there' s some rides you missed, why don' t you just go on back and i' il tell her you couldn' t make it.
I drove all the way here to take care of my child and your suggesting i' m not a good mother?
Marianne can' t go no where, if we could have taken her to disneyland we would' ve.
Maggie fitgerald?
Right down here 301.
---- >( family talk, pig snortling LOL) < -----
Just some kind of legal thing. what is it?
How we all doing here?
Sorry darling but we aint got alot of time, mr johnson is charging us a lot of money to be here to make sure this is done proper.
Why dont you just leave that and i' il read it to her later?
Hey old man, you part of our family? stay the hell out of this.
Read it to me momma.
Just something legal, protect your money.
Momma you dont have to worry, the boxing commission is paying for all this, everything.
What if they dont marianne? mr johnson says they can take my house.
If you assign your assets to your mother no one will be able to touch them.
No doctors, no funeral expenses, nothing.
Now look, why dont you just leave it and i' il just read it to her later on.
Mr dunn with respect this aint your business.
Alright, i' il be out in the hall.
You' ve been a good daughter marianne, you sign that paper it' il take care of your family,
like the way your daddy would have wanted you to, uh how do you make your mark.
Can you hold a pen?
Huh?
You got to put it in her mouth.
Here you go honey.
Now you know how i feel about that.
I did pretty good.
You lost marianne, ain' t your fault the way i heard it but you lost, dont want to lost the rest of what you got left.
What happen to you?
What' s that supposed to mean?
Momma you take mardee and jd get home, before i tell that lawyer there your so worried about your welfare you never signed those house papers like you were supposed to,
so anytime i feel like it, i can sell that house from under your fat lazy hill billy ass, and if you ever come back, that' s exactly what i' il do.
Well maybe someone oughta count to 10.
Doesn' t smell real pretty does it doc?
You might have to lose it maggie.
They took my leg boss.
It' s gonna be alright, here.
All I hear is your voice boss.
Need anything?
Need to know what mokulsha means.
Well, you didn' t win, i dont have to tell ya.
You are the meanest man i' ve ever met, no wonder no one loves you,
you remind me of my daddy.
Well he must have been a very intelligent, handsome man.
You ain' t gonna make me tap no more 8' s are ya?
No i was, looking at this catalog from city college,
I thought i' d get ya a wheel chair maybe the kind that operates by moving through a straw, thought maybe you' d like to go back to school.
Got a favor to ask you boss.
Sure, anything you want.
Well I want what my daddy did for Axl.
Don' t even think about that.
I can' t be like this frankie, not after what i' ve done, i' ve seen the world, people chanted my name, hell, not my name, some damn name you gave me, they were chanting for me,
I was in magazines, you think i' d ever dream that happen?
I was born 2 pounds 1/ 2 ounces, daddy used to tell me i' d fight to get into this world, and i' d fight my way out, that' s all i wanna do frankie, i just dont want to fight you to do it,
I got what i needed, i got it all, dont let em keep taking it away from me, dont let me lie here til i can' t hear those people chanting no more.
I can' t, please, please dont ask me.
I' m asking.
Hello.
In the middle of the night, maggie had found the wrong solution, she' d bit her tongue.
Stop, stop, look at me look at me.
Nearly bled to death before they stitched her up, she came around and ripped them out before frankie even got there, they stitched her up again, padded the tongue so she couldn' t bite.
You can' t do it, you know that.
I do father, you dont know how thick she is, how hard it was to train her, other fighters would do exactly what you would say to them and, she' d ask why this, and why that, and do it her own way anyway, she fought for the title, wasn' t by anything, wasn' t by listening to me.
But now she wants to die, and i just want to keep her with me,
and i swear to god father it' s, it' s committing a sin by doing it, by keeping her alive I' m killing her, how do i get around that?
You don' t, you step aside frankie, you leave her with god.
She' s not asking for god' s help, she' s asking for mine.
Frankie i' ve seen you at mass almost everyday for 23 years, the only person that comes to church that much is the kind that can' t forgive themself for something, whatever sins you carry there nothing compared to this, forget about god, or heaven and hell, if you do this thing, you' d be lost, somewhere so deep.
YOu' il never find yourself again.
I' m keeping her sedated so she wont try that again.
Went to see maggie this morning, you must have been somewhere else.
Ya.
You got a fighter i dont know about?
Wasn' t your fault, i was wrong to say that.
Your damn right, i found you a fighter, and you made her the best fighter she could be.
I killed her.
Don' t say that, maggie walked through that door with nothing but guts, no chance in the world of being what she needed to be, a year and a half later she' s fighting for the championship of the world, you did that, people die every day frankie mopping floors, washing dishes, and you know what their last thought is, i never got my shot, because of you maggie got her shot, if she dies today you know what her last thought would be?
I think i did alright.
I know i could rest with that.
Ya, ya.
Alright,
I' m gonna disconnect your air machine and your gonna go to sleep
and i' il give you a shot and you' il stay asleep.
Mokulsha means "my darling, my blood"
He gave her a single shot, it was enough adrenaline to do the job a few times over, he didn' t want her going through this again.
Then he walked out, i dont think he had anything left.
I went back to the gym, waited figuring he' d turn up sooner or later
and that' s when a ghost came through the door.
I got to thinking what you said mr grant.
And what was that Danger?
Anybody can lose one fight.
That' s the truth, go ahead and put your clothes on, you missed a lot of training. will do mr grant, sure thing.
Frankie never came back at all,
Frankie didn' t leave a note, and nobody knew where he went,
I' d hope he' d gone to find you, to ask you one more time to forgive him, but maybe he didn' t have anything left in his heart, i' d just hope he found some place where he could find a little peace, a place set in the cedars and oak trees, somewhere between no where and goodbye, but that' s probably wishfull thinking, no matter where he is, i thought you should know what kind of man your father really was.

Work, romance, family?
Well... I...

These film people they' re so bizarre you know, one minute they...
One minute they' re brown- nosing me,
The next they' re talking to me like I' m a complete fucking idiot.
Why don' t you go ahead and pick 3 more cards?
Well, there is no mystery to runing this business, if you follow your instincts and surround yourself with people that you know and trust...

There' s somebody from your past who could be a real asset to you in this venture.
Oh look at that!

Hello, Julia hi.
No no I just try to put her down for a nap, what' s up?
You are fucking kidding me?
The NEA grant?
But I don' t...
What...
What does that mean?
Because of the political content?
What are they...
No don' t... go ahead, go go just take it, but call me back and tell me what they recommend because you know what?
I think we should sue them.
No I' m not kidding, yeah I' il talk to you later.
The NEA just pulled their funding because the art of decent is critical of the Bush administration.
Hey... That gotta be unconstitutional
Yeah well Julius is talking to our lawyer about it right now...
They try to get it into some kind of subcomitty hearing to testify before congress.
You know, this is the new maccarthysm, that what it is.
Are you loosing your stipend?
I don' t know probably.
I mean, because it was allocated on the NEA grant.
This adimistration is fucking criminal, that' s what it is...
Before you know it, the first amendment....
We have to let go Angus.
We have to let Angus go...
I can' t believe you just said that.
We can' t afford him, we couldn' t afford him before you lost your funding.
You' re gonna have to get real about our finances or we gonna be completely wiped out
Thanks, no thank you for laying your petty, bourgeois anxiety on top of my already profound anger and disappointment over losing something that means so much to me!
- Give her to me.
- Thank you.
Just give her to me, look I' il feed her.
Yeah this is Bette Potter for Greaten Nash.

I was going over the new menu of Lara.
'Cause you know, a lot of our community are vegetarians.
A lot of vegan, and God forbid, we should forget those lactose- intolerant lesbians.
Billie, we did not discuss changing menu.
Oh come on Kit, you don' t want to go to every single details with me.
I don' t?
No, you want me to come in here, take charge and free things up for you.
Hey darling how are you doing?

Her aunt, Kit Potter...
Oh I' m Angus, Partridge.
I' m her Manny
Oh... excuse me did you say her Manny?

Ohhhh I see, so my sister hires a dude to take care of her baby.
Such a problem solver that girl
She is a very smart lady
Yes she is, waht a... a...
Angus the manny, I' m gonna call you Mangus
Oh... ok
So what don' t you come in and have something, come in and have a drink.
So that' s my office.

I' il show you one of the sands babies.
So... has Bette found a new job yet?
Well, she' s gonna *** look at her...
Hey sister sit over here, I' m with Mangus
Hey
Hi, I see you meet my sister
Yeah I think she put five pounds on me
Oh he can afford it with that skinny booty of his!
Have you ever seen one so small and tight?
I' m really not in the habit of checking out the nanny' s ass
Well... what did you get at the library?
Um...
I got 'Going to Pieces Without Falling Apart' by Mark Epstein.
Why are you going to pieces?
Well... first of all the NEA pulled the grant from my schoulders this morning... because we live in the most repressive climat in the last fifty years
Oh... that' s so fucked up...
Yeah... and then secondly Tina is so freeked out about money that...
I should consider taking that city bank job
Which just makes me wanna kill myself.
Hmmm...
Don' t even think about taking a job that doesn' t make your heart sing.
Tell her like it is Mangus.
Being Angelica' s nunny.
Makes my heart sing totally.
Yeah...
Oh...
Pema Chodron, read this one first 'Comfortable With Uncertainty'...
Kit thanks, for the calories
Bye
Kit
Oh... oh...
God...
He is one cute nanny
You' re so bad.
I' ve decided I' m going to have much more of a presence here.
I don' t know anything about the film industry but I know we could do better, than we have made.
Charlene has only ever been interested in low budget B slasher movies.
Not now that Peabody ownes it.
I mean, just look at our publishing house, we have:
Stiron, Tudion, Joyce Carlo, Snapickle...
You should be minning all these titles for developement
Exactly.
So...
Are you interessted?
Am I interessted in what Helena?
Coming to work for me
Well...
With me
You have much more experience in this record than I do...
So you' d pretty much have free wings to do whatever you think best.
Within reason.

Oh honey I' m sure that we gonna find out what their plans are tonight at dinner.
Oh my god is she coming to dinner with us?
Of course she' s coming to dinner with us.
- You' re right, you' re right of course she' s coming to dinner.

- Ok ok you' re right she is nice...

We brought you a present from Colorado
Cows balls?
From her new album on Martha records, that was Amy Cook singing 'Million Holes In Heaven'.
And I am Alice Pieszecki, and you' re listening to the chart on KCRW welcome back...
Today on the chart we' re looking at... how do you end a vicious psycho.
OOh, and for those of you out there in radioland who are sick of hearing me rant about my ex, Dana, you' il be happy to know this is not about her.
This continuum of connectedness is about the cause and effect... of one psychotropic drug after another to the point where you' re medicating your medication.
Why don' t we start with... the very first anti- depressive I tried.
It made me just a little intense.
So, then I said to my doctor... can you just give me somethingh strong, really strong, that will just make me happy, is that too much to ask?
So he gave me Lithium.
So that one really just made me haculinate that I was happy.
Did you change your hair?
Then, the... a... the withdrawal from those two drugs gave her A. D. D.
So, I got the A. D. D. drug.
You know the one.
I snort mine...
Do you snort yours?
Gurber Munster wrote me prescription for the new SSRI which he highly recommends, but said under rare cases may cause me to commit suicide.
So I was a little scared to take those...
Which meant I wasn' t on anything...
Which meant I actually felt like having sex again.
Which...
Really made me want to kill myself.
How long ago did you first notice it?
Umm... just few weeks ago.
Ok
Actually I probably noticed it before that but I kinda ran away...
So
I do have a rash... if you could look... take a look at it.
- Ah I bet that' s from your sport' s bra - yeah...
Then I could give you a little hydric- cortizone cream to help sews it.
But is there any history of breasts cancer in your family?
Not that I know of.
You really should find out Dana, are your parents still alive?
Yes, still alive, still together.
Great so ask your mum for a history of your family.
Ok? 'cause it' s just... you know good thinghs to know.
So, have there been any changes in the color or texture of your breasts?
No
And any discharge from the nipple?
Um no
Ok up you get
Usually these little cysts are benin, a lot of women just have lumpy breasts.
I do, I have fibrous breasts.
It' s pretty gross.
It' s perfectly normal... and I' m just checking your lymph nodes here.
Especially in women your age,
It' s not like there is anythingh to be too concerned about.
- Ok
The lymph nodes are a little swollen but that could be from anything, the cold, even brushing your teeth too hard.
I' m a super hard theeth brusher.
Well you' re too young Dana to start getting mammograms on a regular bases.
But I' d like to do one, just to make sure everything is allright.
So, I am going to send you down to radiation.
And you just take that with you.
Fuck...
Fuck.
Oh, hi Ruth, how are ya?
27, Alice.
27... 27, what do you mean?
That the number of times, that you mentioned Dana... in this broadcast, which is down from 43 in the previous show.
See, what I tell you, I' m practically over her.
I could fired you right now.
You could?
But I am not going to.
I am gonna give you one more chance.
But, I need to know in advance what your topics are gonna be.
And I' d like to see your script.
Yes, I' d like to see your script, I need to see your script, and which the letters D. A followed by N. A are nowhere in evidence.
How about that?
O k
Ok
You look good...
In that orange.
Ok come closer.
come on, take your breast, come on.
Like this?
Place it on the lower plate.
- That' s good.
- Like this.
Allright
And then I' m gonna lower the upper plate
Ok
Now maybe... a little unconfortable... but it' il only last for a few seconds.
It' s allright, I' m a hard- ass... a hard boob.
- Hold your breast - Ok
This is KCRW Santa Monica at 89. 9, music and MPR news, morning, noon and night.
Don' t forget to listen to chart with Alice Pieszecki thursday afternoon at 3 o' clock.
DAAANNNNNNAAAA.
Excuse me.
Excuse me sorry, would you mind turning it off?
Thanks
God... that show is so funny.
Alice Pieszecki, the host is completely falling appart because her girlfriend left her.
The girlfriend just seems like this complete nitwit... and you don' t know why Alice is so obsessed with her in a first place.
Do you have any idea why this is taking so long?
Dana Farebanks.
The doctor Wilson is waiting for you in her office.
You can go back upstairs.
Ok thanks.
Byred it sounds like a personnal add from my ex girlfriend.
Right, well a byred 4 is a diagnostic assessment. no this suspicious mass Dana could be absolutly nothing.
It could be what we call a fibro adenoma. farbbb.... blaaaa head muma, what?
I got soya bean pods in my boobs?
It' s a benin solid lump.
But with the byred 4 we' re going to do a biospy.
Now I can get you in for that tomorrow with doctor Shapeero.
I' m suppose to go out to dinner tonight.
You go out ahead, I mean...
Just do exactly as you were planning to do because this is not a diagnosis... and with biopsys in pre- menoposal women, they' re mostly benin.
It' s probably nothing... right
But... we gonna find out for sure.
But try not to think about it tonight allright?
Yeah sure I can do that...
Yeah.
Is she asleep?
Uh?...
Um... in her bed.
How was your lunch with Helena?
It' s fine.
Are you hidding a book in that magazine?
It' s.... um...
Mark Epstein talked about it in his lecture last week...
It' s
She a buddhist philosopher, Pema Chodron.
How cute... she looks like a wookie.
Actually there are a lot in there that... reminded me of you...
There is this one passage:
'We work on ourselves in order to help others but we also help others in order to work on ourselves.'
I don' t know about that...
I mean, the people I work with, they' re truly selfless.
Oh no no.
I don' t think she meant it the way that you' re taking it.
That' s... um...
Oh actually, there is another passage that... that reminded me of me...
I...
'Feeling irritated, restless, affraid, and hopeless, is a reminder to listen more carefully.'
I' m gonna go feed her, if we' re gonna go to this Jenny dinner.
Um...
Would you call Angus...
And...
Make sure he' s on his way?
Helena Peabody offered me a job.
So are you considering it?
I don' t know yet...
Somebody in this family' s gotta make a living.
I have made a living for the last 15 years,
I don' t think my ability to make a living is really in question.
I' m not questionning your ability, I' m questionning your desire.
I thought you hated the movie business?
There is a lot I hate about the movie business...
I definitely haven' t said yes... but she made it very attractive.
So then there' s... no reasons that I... should feel... threatenend or...
No... there' s nothing between us anymore, nothing at all.
Well... did you talk about money?
I don' t know yet.
I don' t...
I
I still don' t know if I' m okay with it...
I...
I' m not sure it' s up to you.

I' il just have a salad and a side of fries.
It' s a nice green salad as a roquette frisée and shaved juicy artichokes with a pine corned fuse juice.
How much is that?
14 dollards Madam.
Ok.
I' m... actually I still read screenplays for these couple screen writers friends that I know. that...
I would love that.
Have you decided madam?
Euh...
I would like what ever the chef recommends, what is good tonight?
Armione is recommending the lobster tonight.
It comes with sauteed baby chickory, lemon froth and shaved dry tuna roe.
Sold.
Sounds really good, I love lobster.
Oh baby you should go for it...
Armione does amazing things with see food you guys.
Well...
According to L. A. magazine restaurant reviews but... who reads that?
Ok I' il have the Cioppino
Great.
Thank you
Althought, I' m sure it doesn' t compare to the one that Lara made last week, it was amazing.
It' s good, it was damn good.
Oh yeah I was gonna ask you guys um... when you had Martina and Theresa over um... what do they think about sculpture in your house? you know that one with the two athlete bodies, that like kinda ugly... where they like...
How do you... what?
It freaks me out, who does she know that we had Martina over for dinner?
Allright, just let go baby please.
Are you ready to order?
Oh yes... um...
I... the Green Pea Ravioli please.
Thank you
- Did you order?...
I' m sorry.
- Oh yeah.
Jenny tell me about your book, your editor have you heard back from them lately?
No, I think she has a very busy schedule.
Oh...
Moira, do you read Jenny' s stuff? um... well, I' m a computer technician...
***
So, who is the editor, that you sent it...?
This lady named Jayne Martin.
Oh my god, Jayne Martin!
- You know her?
- Yes, she' s famous.
Is she that New York Lady, right? you used tell me about... the big editor that you always wanted to talk about?
I mean from school...?
I...
I met her because her daughter was my roommate in the hospital.
So Jayne would come out and visit her.
Was her daughter a... cutter too?
- Oh god...
- Alice!
It' s fine, you know what, it' s so good to talk about it because it' s... fuck it did happen, and it' s better not to tiptoe around all that stuff that' s very generous of you, thank you.
And you' re healthy?
I' m fine.
That' s all what matters.
Yep.
So Jayne Martin' s daughter was sick... and now she has and A. D. disorder and that' s...
Oh god please, please that' s awful, don' t let that happen to our daughter.
Oh my god...
I don' t think it' s possible to control that... but I think what you can control is... how you communicate with them about what' s happened, gonna happen.
'cause I won' t let it.
- Oh honey...
- I mean it
- I mean it aunty Shane, I do mean it. - aunty Shane.
Guys let' s just...
No, let' s don' t talk about this anymore, it' s getting to dark.
- Ok.
- Let' s just... talk about something else.
Ok?
- Ok.
- Allright, allright, allright
- Yes, yes, yes.
- I' m sorry...
Oh I' m sorry.
So, um...
You guys have a kid?
Yeah...
A daughter, she is 6 months old...
Her name is Angelica.
You know a bunch of women back in my dick community in ***.
They' re doing that too.
- Well - It' s cool.
My Angelica...
You are my Angel...
With your Angel eyes...
You are my honey pie.
I think she' s asleep.
You should really think about putting out your own record Kit.
I don' t know anything about...
This internet distribution stuff that they do today.
It' s easy...
My band and I are put out our second record right now.
Really?
You could totally do it Kit I mean... all your poll and all the people you can get to play with ya.
Well...
I...
I' ve got songs...
I...
Kinda *** songs I would love to record.
But I would have to talk to you more about that.
Yeah sure.
I' il be happy to talk you through it.
- Whaou - Oh, whaou!
I took a...
It' s amazing.
Sea urchess.
- Look what you got.
- It' s so beautiful.
That is absolutely incredible.
- Does anybody wanna taste?
- Yeah, I would love to.
So uh...
Dana and I, we booked our tickets to southern France, you guys, we leave on the 15th next month.
- Oh, fun!
- We' re taking a food and wine tour.
Does anybody want some of my lobster?
What' s that sauce on it, Bette?
I think it' s lemon froth and shaved dry tuna roe.
Whatever, it' s good, right?
Do you want some...
Do you want some lobster, Moira?
- No I' m fine, thanks.
- Well, it' s not gonna bite ya.
No, I' m fine, thank you.
Moira, don' t you like lobster?
Yeah, actually I like it a lot.
Do you want some?
I don' t think the claws have any sauce...
I' m sorry I only have the tale left, but you know...
If you want, you can have the tale and wipe the sauce off.
- No that' s cool.
- Are you sure?
Yeah.
I know something interresting about lobsters.
What?
You don' t have to put a lid on the pot when you cook female lobsters.
Does anybody know why?
No
When you cook a pot of male lobsters, and they realize they' re in this pot of boilling water, they all start totally freaking out.
And they start making these little ladders, and helping each other getting out of the pot.
So you have to put a lid on the pot to keep them inside.
But female lobsters, you don' t have to put a lid on the pot.
They all just start grabbing each other and they' re like holding each other down.
They' re like:
"If I' m gonna die, everyone' s gonna die."
And none of them' s want to let any of the others get out of the pot.
It' s a real shame, isn' t it?
Whaou.
Just get yourself down!
Jenny, I' m just gonna go.
You' il get a ride home from Carmen and Shane.
Uh, will you excuse me for a second?
Moira?
Moira!
What are you doing?
I' m just gonna go, okay?
Why?
Look, this sould cover me.
Okay, I don' t understand.
Did something happened, just now?
They' re your friends, I don' t really fit in.
Oh my God, Moira.
They' re getting to know you and...
That' s gonna take some time and they' re gonna think your' re fucking amazing when they get to know you.
Maybe she kept Jenny from felling lonely.
You know what it is, when you' re... with someone that' s completly wrong for you.
Just because you don' t wanna be alone.
I don' t know, maybe she' s Jenny' s type.
Oh yeah!
'Cause Carmen' s such a stone- butch too.
I wouldn' t certainly call Moira stone- butch.
Allright and what wold you describe her as?
Miss "Hi, let us butches help you ladies out with your luggage"?
Right?
She comes from a place where... you know, you have to define yourself as either or
It' s probably the other language that she has to describe herself.
She has the language of the "Chick kicking boobs" and that lumberjack walk.
I' m just surprised that she wanted to roleplay like that.
Especially after everything that Jenny' s been through.
Well, she could be completly different in the bedroom.
Maybe she' s "butch in the streets and femmme in the sheets"
Oh my God, that' s so original.
You know what, what difference does that make whether someone is butch or femme?
Leave the labels alone, just let people be who they are.
Right.
What do you guys thought of that lobster thing anyway?
Oh come on!
Competitive female lobsters.
It' s so not true!
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.
Do we have dessert?
And I love that child.
I fucked up, with my own.
Oh, every parents fucks up one way or another.
No, I really fucked up.
I just left him, when he wasn' t bigger than that.
I just dumped him with his stuff with his father and old- school grand- parents
And went off doing my music. now I don' t really have a leg to stand on complaining about why he' s a fondamentalist bigot
Here' s what I think about that:
What do you think about that Mr. Mangus?
I think when you' re called to play music, there' s not a lot you can do about this.
Sometimes, it pulls even stronger than that biological thing that bonds a mother to her child.
Well, allright then.
Good night, Mr. Mangus.
Good night.
I will take that.
Thanks.
Oh Bette, no no no no!
- No - Yeah!
- We should do the maths.
- No, no no, I' ve got it.
No, really, it' s Jenny' s comming home dinner and it would be my privilege.
Thank you, that' s very generous of you.
- That' s sweet Bette.
- You' re welcome.
- Bette, Thank you.
- There you are.
I just wanna talk, okay?
I' m not gonna attack.
What do you want to talk to me about?
I just wanna know if you' re happy.
Yeah, I' m happy.
I mean, for the most part, I' m happy.
I' m glad one of us is.
Okay.
Sorry.
No, I' m sorry.
I' m sorry that you' re unhappy I' m sorry that I made you unhappy.
I don' t know what to do.
What can I do?
I' m getting over this.
I' m working really hard to get over this.
Maybe we could be friends again one day.
I would really love that.
I miss you.
Come back to me then.
Alice...
Okay.
Okay.
I let you wash your hands.
I know how you like to wash your hands after you go to the bathroom.
Everybody likes to wash their hands after they go to the bathroom.
Yeah, but it' s super- cute the way you do it.

Is everything okay?
Hmm hmm.
What a day...
Whaou.
I' m sorry Ma' am, but your credit card was declined.
You' re kidding me.
I don' t know how that' s possible.
Bette, no no no.
No, really, it' s not a big deal.
You know, I bought some ***, they probably put me over the limit.
It' s not a big deal.
- Oh, I remember.
I put a...
- Stop.
Bette, Bette...
Jenny, no, you' re still our gest of honour, no matter what.
Yeah.
Fine.
Does this make you happy now?
Helena, hi, it' s Tina.
I hope I' m not calling too late.
No...
Actually I' ve been thinking about your proposition.
And...
I think I' d like to give it a try.
Don' t.
Hey.
You heard anything from her?
No.
I' m sure she' s okay.
She' s a big girl, she can take care of herself.
I feel like such an asshole.
I should have gone with her.
I' m sorry we weren' t more acomodating to your friends.
We were just excited to see you.
And generous about you and...
I don' t know.
I gess she should understood that.
I fucked up.
No you didn' t.

Are you that happy?
Don' t open the door to just anybody >> Napisy pobrane z http: // napisy. org << >>>>>>>> nowa wizja napisów <<<<<<<<
Will you be ready soon?
Half an hour.
Hair?
5 minutes
Look.
We must show this.
No.
It' s too ugly.
I' m telling you, it' s super important.
I can' t shoot this crap.
Romain, let me introduce you.
One last light check.
Come on in.
Good morning, doctor.
Please sit down.
How are you feeling?
How did the tests go?
A bit painful, but I was expecting worse.
Feeling better now.
Good.
And I must say they' re not very good.
I got Aids?
No,... Nothing to do with Aids.
You have a tumor.
A malignant one.
Cancer?
A kind of cancer, yes.
That' s the lesions to my liver and lungs?
Same cause.
What does that mean?
Has the cancer spread?
Yes.
We' il do everything to cure you.
I will not lie to you.
There' s a high risk...... that the tumor will resist treatment, and keep growing instead.
Can' t it be taken out?
No.
It' s inoperable
What' s more, the tests have not identified the point of origin.
What about treatment?
Drugs, radiotherapy
Drugs, as in chemotherapy?
Yes.
Out of the question.
A friend of my parents' died from cancer 2 years ago.
He had chemo, lost his hair, stopped eating, suffered horribly...
Do not compare.
Each cancer, each chemotherapy is different.
What are my chances for remission?
There' s a slight chance, but it exists.
You are 31.
You will fight.
'Slight', does that mean 50% or 5% odds?
5%, right?
Yes, roughly.
Even less than 5%?
Unfortunately.
Yes.
Without treatment, how long do I have?
Difficult to answer.
We' re talking averages here.
In similar cases, 3 months.
But it could be 1 month.
Or 1 year.
I don' t see the point of heavy stuff like chemo.
It won' t work anyway.
I do not judge you.
You are young; I would rather you fight.
Even if your chances are small, they are not nil.
You should grab even a single chance.
But it' s your decision, and I shall respect it.
You fly to Tokyo on the 15th, you land in the morning.
You shoot the 2pm Vogue swimsuit issue the very same day.
You take the evening train for Kyoto.
Romain, are you listening?
Yes.
You sure you want to go?
Of course.
Why do you ask?
I don' t know.
Lately I find you strange.
It' s like nothing interests you.
Of course not.
Don' t worry.
Maybe you should take some time off, we cancel the shoots,...... and you come back in great shape.
That the financial stakes are high.
Not if you mess the shoots up!
Do you think I' m capable of that?
Sometimes it is best to turn down offers, so as not to disappoint.
You already approached someone else?
No...
I told Jean- Baptiste.
He' d agree to go, just in case...
Tell him to get fucked.
I' m going to Japan.
Well, I want to tell you I love you.
I' m very ill and will die soon.
Romain. food' s ready!
I' m coming.
Why do you lock up?
Last time you used to always let me in.
These days are over.
I want to ask you something.
What, this time?
Be nice to your sister.
You know she and Alain are not doing great.
Ok.
Don' t worry.
It hurts your sister that you don' t show an interest in her.
You never call her, you don' t talk to her...
You already told me, you keep repeating yourself!
Then make an effort, that' s all.
Ok.
Thank you.
See how much he' s grown?
He' s truly adorable.
Amazing how much he looks like you!
Like whom?
Same nose.
Don' t you feel like having one too?
Stop it mum, please...
You already have 2 grandchildren.
Isn' t that enough?
You know your mother, strong maternal instinct.
I only say this because I know...... Romain always liked children.
Isn' t that true darling?
Too bad your son is a fag, no offsprings from me.
Romain, in a few years...... I' m sure adoption will be possible, whatever your sexual orientation.
Shall we eat?
I' m starving.
We' re signing next week; hope it works out!
You' re very well prepared.
I know but I' m stressed out.
I know the guy is very difficult to convince.
I' m not worried for you.
And you, Romain, what' s up?
Nothing in particular.
Everything ok, work- wise?
Yes, it' s ok.
Japan is canceled?
Yes, not too interesting, and lots of work in Paris right now.
Such a shame...
I would have loved going there...
You were not invited.
That' s what is sad.
I don' t have your talent.
Do you realize we have a photographer in the family, and he' s never shot a picture of my kids.
That' s true, and I' d love for you to take a portrait of your dad and myself...
Just like in the English magazine you showed us.
That would be fun.
He prefers actresses and top models.
Don' t say that Sophie, there was no opportunity, otherwise I' m sure Romain would have done something.
No.
She' s right
Why do you say that?
I don' t feel like taking her kids' picture.
Romain, please.
Leave it, dad.
You want to know why I don' t feel like it? they are your things, they belong to you.
I would have seen your face in them.
Just thinking about it I feel like puking.
Romain. stop it!
Not surprising your man left you, I understand him.
You give him no space, feels like you made the kids on your own.
Sophie!
Stop it.
Romain, you stop it too.
She' s mad!
That' s too much, Romain!
Why do you talk to her that way?
She' s not well, she' s fragile.
I' m fragile too
What' s wrong with you?
Drive me home please; I' m drunk.
I broke my spectacles. it' s ok, calm down...
Are things ok with Sacha?
Normally, neither good nor bad.
We' re gonna split.
Shit!
Why?
Like all couples, passion dies, routine takes over...
Does he still live with you?
He' s out of work, no money.
Ok, thanks.
What is it you bought?
Nothing.
Just a bit of coke.
I thought you stopped taking that shit!
It' s just once in a while.
Helps me get a hard on.
Good night
You know, Romain...
What?
Don' t do anything foolish.
Your mum cannot take it.
How about you?
I cannot either.
Why do you always talk about mum, her reactions, as if nothing can hurt you?
I don' t know.
A habit.
Pity, isn' t it?
Maybe I never learnt to talk about myself.
There' s something I always wanted to ask you...
Yeah?
Why didn' t you and mum get a divorce?
Because we always loved each other.
But you cheated on her...
A few times.
So what?
I don' t know.
One night when I was a kid, I woke up and spied on one of your conversations in the kitchen.
Mum had found a letter from a woman.
She was crying.
You were not consoling her.
I always thought you would separate.
See?
We' re still together.
Do you regret it?
Of course not.
Why would I?
Is it because of Sacha you' re telling me all this?
Yeah, maybe.
Do I scare you?
Sometimes.
Good night, son.
Hi!
Still playing that crap?
You' re not 12 anymore.
Where were you?
At my parents' place.
Was it good?
Yeah.
The usual.
You don' t love me anymore, right?
I don' t know.
I don' t love you either.
What game are you playing?
I' m not playing.
I' m telling you the truth.
I don' t feel anything.
Some tenderness at times.
Why do you tell me that now?
It' s nice to tell the truth, no?
Don' t tell me it' s painful.
I won' t believe you.
Do you want us to stop?
Do you want me to leave?
Yes.
Where will I go?
What will I do?
I don' t care, just beat it.
What' s wrong?
You never spoke to me that way.
I' m fed up with this shit situation.
You do nothing.
You live off me.
Who do you think you are?
You think you are better, with your shit photos, your self importance?
At least I don' t need you to live on.
Take your stuff and clear out!
You' re the strongest.
Happy?
Now kill me.
One of these days...
Sorry.
Sorry.
Are you finished?
Yes.
Thanks.
Few clients today.
Business is slow.
You work here everyday?
Yes, five days a week.
Tomorrow is the week end.
I can rest.
Good.
Are you going back home?
No, going to visit my grandmother.
Is she ill?
No, she' s in great health.
You' right, often if we visit our grandmother, that' s because she' s about to die.
For me it' s just to tell her I love her.
That' s nice.
No.
I' m not a nice person.
Do you have children?
Beg your pardon?
Just making conversation.
No.
No children.
Single, no kids?
That' s right.
Miss!
Yes.
Sorry.
You should tell your parents.
I tried, but I couldn' t.
Why?
I think no one wants to hear that.
And it stresses me too much:
Mum would smother me even more, and dad would disappear at once...
I think that, deep down, I like it that no one knows.
To imagine the look on their faces when they' il hear the news.
Did you think of the remorse, the guilt you are going to cause?
Yes.
Sometimes.
I don' t mind.
I won' t be around to see it.
It' s childish.
Selfish.
Give me a hand.
You' re not finishing your food?
No.
I' m full.
It was very good.
Make an effort.
You must eat.
Is that allowed?
Everything is allowed now.
Can I have one?
Who did you tell?
No one.
Only you.
Your friends, colleagues?
No.
I didn' t say anything.
I distanced myself, said I needed a holiday.
Your sister?
Are you crazy?
I didn' t tell her.
She would be too happy, she would love to pity me, just like she does her children.
There' s no shame in inspiring pity or tender feelings.
It could be an opportunity for you to talk to each other.
I don' t feel like it.
Not with her.
And Sacha?
I didn' t have the guts.
Why did you tell me, then?
Because you are like me.
You will die soon.
Did you take your medication?
Yes.
I' il prepare my vitamins.
We didn' t go for a walk in the woods.
We could go tomorrow morning, before you leave.
Never mind.
I just wanted to see the spot where we built a hut with Sophie.
There are a few bits of it left.
Look at all I have to take:
anti oxydation. this is for the skin, this for the hair, this for bones, against osteoporosis.
this is some type of Omega,
I will die in excellent health.
Don' t talk nonsense.
That' s true.
You know, Romain...
What?
Tonight, I would like to leave with you.
I don' t know what to do.
I don' t know what' s good.
I follow my instinct.
After your grandfather' s death, I was a wreck.
I thought I was gonna die.
So I left, I fled.
I abandoned my child.
Your father.
I could not take care of him anymore, it was not possible.
I kept seeing Jacques in his smile, in his eyes.
I was called a bad mother, a whore even.
Your father never forgave me.
But I know I was right.
If I had not left, if I had not had all these lovers, I would have died too.
You may call it selfishness, but it' s only survival instinct.
Why do you tell me all this?
Because we are alike.
Knock Knock, madam.
Would you by chance have any food?
What for?
I have not eaten in two days.
I am very poor.
But I did not invite you.
Romain.
Have a look.
What?
Look here!
A rabbit!
What' s wrong?
Why doesn' t he move?
He must be sick.
Can I bring it home to cure it?
It' s no use.
They can pass you lots of diseases.
Please, dad!
Don' t insist!
Put it down.
If we leave it, it will be eaten!
Nature' s law, Romain.
Come on.
Come on.
Did I wake you?
No.
What' s the matter?
You cannot sleep?
No.
I cannot.
Do you want to talk?
No.
I just want to sleep in your bed.
You know I sleep naked.
It' s ok - I won' t peek.
Ok.
I' m ready.
You don' t want to stay for lunch?
I' m not hungry.
On the road, if you are tired, make sure you stop.
Ok.
This is for you.
Picked them early this morning.
For my funeral?
When you don' t want them anymore, throw them away.
I love you.
Me too.
Don' t cry, or it will be too tough.
Romain.
What?
Wouldn' t you try chemotherapy, just for my sake?
You know perfectly well it won' t work.
You never know.
Miracles?
Yes.
You don' t believe that yourself.
I believe in you!
You are sweet.
Too bad we didn' t meet earlier, I would have married you.
Where will you go when you get back?
I' il stay home.
Call me, ok?
Ok.
Let me take a picture.
7 Euro, please.
Thank you.
Have a nice day.
Hello.
Do you recognize me?
Yes.
Can I sit down?
Sure.
I work at the gas station across the road, I came to see my husband.
I see.
We would like to ask you something.
Yes?
Well, my husband has problems.
Yes?
He' s sterile.
So?
Well.
We both find you very handsome... we would like to ask you... if you would accept to sleep with me.
Since you are young, we thought you probably wouldn' t mind too much.
He' s ok with it, don' t worry.
Well...
I...
You don' t have Aids?
No.
We could try, if you want.
We saved a bit of money, we could pay you.
No.
Don' t bother.
You do not want?
I' m not interested.
I don' t like children.
Romain, the place is clear.
I took all my stuff.
Bye.
Sasha
Strange, I dream a lot.
You were in my last one.
We were sleeping together.
It was sweet and very sexual at the same time.
It was making me feel good.
Funny, cos you' re not my type at all.
Actually in my dreams I sleep with anyone.
My father, my mother... even with myself as a kid, I guess I' m enjoying it before I die.
Time heals everything, except for us.
Lately you' ve been aggressive, violent, full of disdain towards me. while I was making efforts, trying to understand you.
Trying to make overtures, maybe awkwardly but I was trying.
I don' t understand your attitude, what it is you hate so much in me.
I often remember the games we played as children, that complicity that brought us together, our quarrels, our enthusiasm and that brotherly love that has disappeared and which I miss so much.
I hope to hear from you.
I' ve taken the first step and I now wait for yours.
Your loving sister, Sophie.
Allo?
It' s me.
Romain?
Yes.
It feels strange hearing your voice...
I wanted to let you know I received your letter.
So?
Do you find it ridiculous?
No.
It moved me.
It was good for me.
That' s great.
You know Sophie, I' d like to come and visit you but I don' t quite have the strength lately.
Working too hard?
Yeah, that' s it.
I understand.
I' m already very happy that you called.
I wanted to let you know, it' s not your fault.
I' m the one not feeling too well lately, the one going a bit mad.
Don' t worry.
Ok.
Alrite, I' m gonna leave you now.
Anyway, if you want to see the kids, don' t hesitate to call.
Not your kids.
Kisses.
And I' il be waiting for your call.
Kisses.
Thanks, Romain.
We' re too short.
Let' s take a chair.
Hello!
Hello.
Have you been waiting for long?
No, I just arrived.
You don' t look too good - Are you ok?
Yeah
You should get some sun.
Yeah.
And you, how are you?
They finally hired me!
Great.
Yes, I am happy.
It' s all thanks to you.
No.
I know you called to recommend me.
Well, if you know...
Anyway, if they hired you it' s because you had the right profile.
And you?
I hear that you stopped working?
I needed a break, and...... You met someone, didn' t you.
Why do you say that?
I know you.
Incapable of staying alone!
Do I know him?
No.
How old?
My age.
Good, that' s what you needed.
Did you meet anyone new?
No.
Nothing serious, one night stands.
That' s what I need now: no complications!
See you soon.
You' il call me?
Yeah.
Well, no...
Why do you say that?
What' s wrong?
You' re not feeling well?
I forgot to tell you something.
What?
It' s not easy to say...
Can you walk me back?
Sure.
Do you want a vodka?
You drink during the day now?
Yeah, occasionally.
Ok, one vodka.
So?
Wel...
I miss you.
Is that so?
It' s a bit late now, isn' t it?
Yeah, I know.
I' d like to ask you one thing.
What?
I would like us to make love one last time.
I want to touch you, feel your skin.
I don' t feel like it.
Do I disgust you?
No, I just don' t feel like it anymore.
It' s over.
Just once.
One last time.
Whatever for?
Whatever for...
It' s stuck in my head.
Except today I didn' t think about it, you were the one who said it.
You know what?
I don' t want that.
I understand.
Give me your hand.
Can you feel my heart?
Yes.
It' s still beating.
Good morning.
Good morning.
I' m ready.
Sorry?
You don' t want anymore, it' s too late?
Too late?
For the kid?
No, it' s fine.

Now, boy, I' ve told you time and again.
Now, listen to me.
There' s no horsing around when the train' s coming.
Do you hear me?
Now, go on, get away.
- Looks like she' s on time.
- Yes, she is.
Harrington!
- Let me help you with that, little girl.
- Watch your step.
Watch your step.
There you are, little girl.
So I have to go to the store.
You go get the luggage.
Be careful of the fresh eggs.
- They' re wrapped in paper.
- Ben?
- Yes, dear?
- I want you to write a letter to the president of this railroad.
There were men smoking in the parlour car.
Disgraceful!
- I' ve taken his number.
- Yes, dear.
- Miss Pollyanna?
Aunt Polly?
No, I' m Nancy.
I work for your aunt and I came here to fetch you.
How do you do?
- This is Mr Thomas, the gardener.
- How do you do?
Hello, young lady.
Oh, no, no, no.
Thomas will take that for you.
Oh.
Put it in the back seat.
Oh, good afternoon, Mrs Tarbell.
- Is that Jenny Harrington' s child?
- Yes, it is.
Doesn' t look a thing like any of the Harringtons.
What' s your name, girl?
- Speak up.
- Pollyanna Whittier, ma' am.
Well, you' re a very fortunate little girl.
Most children who have lost their parents would end up in an orphanage.
- You know that, don' t you?
- Yes, ma' am.
Well, thank your lucky stars for such a good woman as your aunt taking you in.
- Yes, ma' am.
- Yes.
Well, see that you' re properly appreciative and don' t cause any trouble.
- Children really never realize -- - Ed?
- Uncle Karl!
- Much too long.
- It' s good to see you.
- Oh, same here.
How' s everything at the house?
Wait till Polly Harrington hears about this!
Right up here in the back seat, honey.
There you are.
Nancy, what are you staring at?
Oh, nothing!
Nothing at all, sir.
- I don' t know if she wants the car or not.
You' il have to ask her yourself.
Your aunt' s waiting for you, miss.
Hurry up.
I haven' t got all day!
Oh, Mr Thomas.
Please put that here.
All right.
You wait here, miss, and don' t touch anything.
- Do you understand?
- Yes, ma' am.
Well, we had, uh, Matthew.
- Isaiah has some very good passages.
- Yes, Isaiah has some very good passages.
- What is it, Nancy?
The little girl is here.
All right, show her in.
What you' ve been waiting for.
About the sermon, Reverend.
Yes.
Now, the transiency of life... that- that fleeting, ephemeral vapour... it appeareth and it vanisheth -- James, the New Testament.
The perishability of our mortal bodies.
You want me to -- to weave a theme of this into my sermon?
- Well, let me tell you what my father said to Reverend Moffet.
What did he say?
He said that you only have the congregation for one short hour a week.
And there are six long days of mischief for them before you get them again.
I see your point.
Strike hard on Sunday the excessiveness of God' s wrath and hope they carry it with them a few days into the week.
- Exactly what I mean.
- Oh, yes, yes.
Well, come in, young lady.
Let' s meet each other properly.
- I' m your Aunt Polly.
- How do you do?
This is the pastor of our church, Reverend Ford.
How do you do?
Well, there' s a family resemblance.
She looks very much like her mother.
Mother always used to say I look like you!
Would you be good enough to stand erect and in a proper manner, please?
And where in the world did you get that dress?
It came in the missionary barrels.
- Missionary barrels?
Her father was a minister.
As a matter of fact, he was a missionary in the British West Indies.
Pollyanna, this is going to be your new home... and I hope you' il be very happy with me.
I' m very sorry about the dress, Aunt Polly.
My father said it was a size too big... but that I should be glad it wasn' t a pair of boys' trousers.
Well, that' s hardly anything to be glad about.
Well, my father always used to say that people --
Yes, well, never mind what your father used to say.
Supper is at 6: 00 sharp, and no one is ever late for meals at this house.
- Yes, ma' am.
- Nancy will show you your room.
I' m very glad you sent for me, Aunt Polly.
Your home is very lovely.
Well, thank you.
It must make you awfully glad.
- Glad?
- That you' re so very rich!
Honestly!
- Did I say something wrong?
- Well, let' s just say... there are about sixty- eleven things you could have said besides that.
No shenanigans in here.
And you clean up after yourself, you hear me?
Yes, ma' am.
- You sure it was Doc Chilton?
- Mrs Tarbell saw him first!
Coming back after all these years!
D- Does she know yet?
- Old blabbermouth Tarbell will see to that.
- Yeah.
Now, mind what you' re doing and don' t spill your milk.
Now, come along.
I need your help.
- All right, all right.
- And if you see Angelica, tell her to come down here too.
- Okay.
- I' m very pleased to have met you, Mrs Lagerlof.
- Mmm.
- Now come along.
Hello.
- What' s his name, please?
- His name happens to be Elizabeth.
Oh!
You' re a girl!
- You' re lovely.
- Now, leave her alone and come along.
How -- How do I address you, please?
Well, just call me Nancy, same as everybody else.
She' s the upstairs maid.
- How do you do?
- Psst!
Psst!
At the back porch.
You know who.
Now?
Oh, for heaven' s sake.
Oh, Angie, would you show her to her room, please?
- Well, I still have two rooms left to do.
- I' il help you with the bedrooms in the morning.
Come on.
Hurry up.
I turn my back for one moment, and what do you do?
You disappear.
- Yes, ma' am.
- I just got through cleaning up this hall.
- Yes, ma' am.
- What are you doing now?
- Who lives in all these?
They' re just there.
- What for?
- That' s what being wealthy is.
You sure are a question- asker, aren' t you?
Now, hurry up.
Come on, come on.
Don' t dawdle.
- Well, what' s the matter?
- Nothing.
Stuffy!
Not much of a room, is it?
But it' s my own anyway.
I' m glad of that.
Ooh, and the bed' s soft.
And it' s got a lovely window.
Who' s that man down there with Nancy?
None of your business.
Just make sure you' re dressed in time for dinner.
You' d think she' d do better than this for her own niece.
Almighty God, we thank thee for thy bounty.
And bless this food unto our nourishment that it may strengthen us... to do thy will in all things.
Amen.
Oh, I' m sorry.
Nancy, would you bring another glass of milk, please?
Yes, ma' am.
My- My clumsy old hand.
Well, now, there' s no harm done.
- Did you find your room satisfactory?
It' s very nice.
Thank you.
You hadn' t mentioned it, so I just wondered.
I' ve never had a whole room to myself before.
I must be higher up in the house than anyone, aren' t I?
Well, I' m not used to children' s noises around the house... and that' s the reason I chose that one.
I really do.
Really!
Aunt Polly?
Do you ever have steak and ice cream?
Are you complaining about the food?
Oh, no!
It' s delicious!
I just wondered.
I love steak.
Father always used to say that if we ever had the money you have... we' d have steak and ice cream three times every day!
Pollyanna, I think we ought to get one thing straight right now.
I don' t want you constantly quoting what your father used to say.
Do you understand?
Nancy, I thought I made myself clear about gentlemen callers.
- Ma' am?
- Now, don' t pretend you don' t understand me.
I saw you and George Dodds out in the summer house.
- George has been every inch a gentleman with me, and it' s not -- - We won' t discuss it.
If you want to remain on my staff, I don' t want you to see him any more.
- Do you understand?
- Yes, ma' am.
This is no concern of yours.
You can finish your supper, Pollyanna.
In the fall, I' il introduce you to Mr Bainbridge.
He' s the principal of our school, and he' il decide what grade you' re to be in.
Pollyanna, I think we should talk about you and your position in this community.
Do you know why it' s called Harrington Town?
My mother said it was named after my grandfather.
That' s right.
And everyone in this town looks to us to set a good example... in the way we conduct ourselves, in our duties and manners... in what we think and even what we say.
So we must be good examples for everyone in everything we do.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, Aunt Polly.
Just remember our family position and conduct yourself properly and modestly.
Oh.
You mean what I said before?
I understand that now.
I' il never say that again.
- You understand what?
- About the money.
I' m not supposed to be glad we' re so very rich, huh?
Well, uh, I think it' s time for you to get ready for bed, young lady.
- What?
I love you, Aunt Polly.
Uh, just a moment, please.
Come back here.
Turn around once.
That dress is disgraceful.
Tomorrow we' il go into town and get you some decent clothes.
- Store- bought?
- But of course.
Where else would we get them?
Out of an actual store?
New clothes?
Well, you' re a Harrington now, and I want you to look like one.
Pollyanna?
Walk up the stairs like a lady, please.
Store- bought clothes!
What do you think of that, Elizabeth?
I wonder if she meant new petticoats too.
And new garters and stockings and underpants.
Don' t tell anyone... but it' s wonderful to be so rich, isn' t it?
I' m going with Mrs Tarbell.
- Would you please take Pollyanna home?
- Yes, madame.
Oh, I' il take that box, Pollyanna.
Now, get into the car, miss.
Oh, Pollyanna.
We' ve simply got to get home!
Oh!
George, stop it!
Oh, Pollyanna, you don' t know my cousin Fred, do you?
- Your cousin Fred?
- This is Pollyanna Whittier.
Miss Harrington' s niece.
The one who' s come to live with her.
Oh, that one.
Hello, Pollyanna.
How are you, honey?
- Good.
Running into you after all these --
- What' s it been, six years?
Say, how' s your ma and pa?
- Well, they' re just fine.
But this girl here, she was always just like a sister to me.
- I tell ya, I love this cousin.
- Will you cut it out?
Well, look, uh, what are you girls doin '?
How' d you like to go down the street and get a great big dish of ice cream?
She probably hates ice cream, doesn' t she?
- Oh, probably.
- Who, me?
- Oh, no.
I love it!
- Really?
Well, now, isn' t that astounding?
Oh, no, really!
I --
Well, I know a wonderful place.
Come on, girls.
Follow old cousin Fred to the land of strawberry frappe.
Unless you' d rather go down the street and have a beer.
You' re funny.
Hey, you two, get down off that truck right now.
How many times did I tell you to keep away from the fire engine?
I' m not gonna tell you again.
Now, get off that ladder.
You- You see?
Right up there under the eaves?
- Just beyond the window is where -- - How' d it happen?
Oh, the pipes busted, Mayor.
Both them boilers went up at the same time.
- And before we knew it, we was up to our necks in water.
- Mr Geary!
- Uh, comin '.
Excuse me.
- Well, the children are safe, thank goodness.
I warned you about this and told you we should do something.
- Now, perhaps, you' il listen.
- I' ve asked everyone... to meet at my house, and we' il discuss this calmly.
A fine orphanage this is!
Water pipes busting all over the place.
Oh, Dr Chilton?
Doctor, could you have a look at Mr Geary' s arm?
- Oh, just scalded it a bit.
- Of course.
- Is there a dispensary here?
This way.
I wonder what' s going on.
Listen, miss, before we go in... it might be just as well not to mention... about the ice cream to your aunt.
My father told me never to tell a lie.
Pollyanna...
But there' s no reason to bring up the subject if it isn' t mentioned.
- I mean, about cousin Fred and all.
- I like your cousin Fred very much.
Oh, he' s all right, I guess.
He' s very handsome, and he has a nice smile.
I don' t know, funny about him.
What do you mean, funny?
I know what it is.
It' s his name.
- He doesn' t look at all like a Fred.
- What?
He looks more like a George to me.
Pollyanna!
Wait a minute.
- Pollyanna, I told you to come directly home.
- Yes, I know, but --
And know that when I tell you to do something, you must do it.
It' s almost 1: 00.
Well, uh, you see, ma' am --
Have you been carrying on with George Dodds again?
- Oh, it was my fault, Aunt Polly.
- What do you mean, your fault?
Well, I- I just dawdled so.
It was the excitement of the new dress, I suppose.
Polly, before Karl Warren get' s here, we must talk.
Oh, I suppose you' re right.
Nancy?
Nancy, get into your uniform and help with the luncheon.
- Yes, ma' am.
- And this is no place for you, young lady.
- We have lots to do, so run along.
- Yes, Aunt Polly.
I' m sorry to start your vacation off like this, Ed, but this won' t take long.
Don' t worry about me, Uncle Karl.
I' il just wait out here.
Fine.
Fine.
Oh, Frieda, Bessie, they' re waiting for you in the conservatory.
Why, Edmond.
This is a surprise.
- Well, if it isn' t young Dr Chilton.
- Mrs Tarbell.
- I' il see if everyone' s ready for you, Polly.
- Thank you.
It' s nice to see you again.
Are you just visiting?
Well, I thought it was time for vacation, the first one in five years.
I' m just waiting here for Karl.
I won' t be in the way here, I hope.
No, no, of course not.
Seems strange, being back here again like this.
Polly, they' re all ready for you.
I' il be right there.
- Why don' t you come in and join us?
- No, I' d rather not butt in.
I' il wait here.
- Well, they' re waiting for me.
- Go ahead.
I' il be fine here.
- Hi.
You better get out of here.
Oh, I' m all right.
It should be parliamentary procedure, same as it' s always been.
- Well, for once, let' s have facts.
- We always observe regular procedure.
We' re here because of an emergency.
- Everybody will be talking at the same time.
- Exactly!
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Is this the town meeting?
It' s in there.
- Oh.
Are you a member of the ladies aid group?
I' m just a child.
I' m not even supposed to be here.
- What' s your name?
- Pollyanna Whittier.
That' s my aunt over there, the pretty one.
This is her house, and I live with her.
Wait just a moment, everybody.
We' il compromise.
Amelia, wouldn' t you like to hear what Karl has to say?
All I' m saying is that it' s time we took some pride in that orphanage... and put up a decent, presentable building that we could all be proud of.
That' s all I' m saying, and I' ve been saying it... for three and a half long years!
If we' d all stop shouting and cooperate --
There is nothing wrong with that building!
All it needs is new plumbing.
Today the plumbing, tomorrow the roof and the Lord knows what --
Excuse me, Reverend.
Who knows what' s gonna happen next?
You were very happy when my father donated the building for the town.
Oh, for Pete' s sake, Polly Harrington, listen to reason.
It' s a dilapidated old relic!
Even my nephew, Dr Chilton there, he noticed that.
Ed, tell them what you said.
Well, I don' t think I should say anything.
No, no.
Tell them what you said.
I want them to hear it.
And I mentioned it seemed a little inadequate for 32 children there.
There you are.
Now you' ve heard it.
We all thank you for your interest, Edmond, but it' s an equipment problem.
We' re talking about Harrington House, which is a landmark in this town... and I intend to see that it stays that way.
- than it would cost to put up a new one.
- It won' t cost this town one cent!
My father donated the building to the town... and I will stand the cost of the pipes or the plumbing... or whatever it is that' s necessary.
It' s my duty, and I will not shirk it.
And I suppose there' s not one of you out there that has the gumption... to stand up and say what you think, is there?
You' re a man of influence in this community.
No, no, I- I, uh --
I- I never take sides in these matters.
Ben?
Speak up.
Come on.
Charlie, what do you say?
Well, say something!
Anybody!
We do have other business to discuss.
- That is, if you' ve finished, Karl.
- Oh, yes, I' ve finished!
There' s your whole town council and your whole civic conscience!
And you certainly don' t need me as mayor around here as long as... you' ve got Polly Harrington running everything.
Karl never changes, does he?
Uh, ladies and gentlemen, we' re having a little light lunch.
Suppose we stop for a while and have a bite.
If you ask me, Reverend Ford should have taken sides with Mayor Warren.
He had the chance, and what' d he do?
He says he never takes sides in these matters.
Oh, stop stickin 'your nose into their business and get these sherbet glasses out there.
- Well, wash some up.
Don' t stand there bellyaching to me about it.
You' re in a fine mood, aren' t you?
Pollyanna, I thought you could use this for your room.
Oh, thank you, Nancy!
Oh, it' s gorgeous!
Oh, well, thanks for not spilling the beans about you- know- who.
- About cousin Fred, you mean?
Isn' t he handsome?
- You did?
How did you know?
Well, sure, it was easy!
I saw you holding hands under the table.
If you ladies got nothing better to do... than sit there gossipin 'and snickerin' --
- Well, talk on your own time.
- This sherbet' s turning to mush.
- All right, all right.
- Nancy?
- Hmm?
- You know that man?
- What man?
- The one at the train station.
The one that was just here.
Well, what was he to Aunt Polly?
Well, you might say they used to be friends sort of.
- You think he' s gonna marry Aunt Polly?
- Who' s gonna marry her?
- She means Dr Chilton.
Who' d want to marry old pickle- faced Harrington?
Nancy, are you and George gonna get married?
- Oh, we hope to someday.
- Oh, I am glad.
I think everyone should be married.
And maybe when you do marry George...
Aunt Polly will see how happy you are and she' il be very glad to get married herself then.
Glad this, glad that!
Do you have to be glad about everything?
- Oh, lay off her, Angie.
- She' s not hurting you.
- Oh, the way she goes on.
Now, that' s enough!
You heard what she said.
Stop pickin 'on the girl.
Now, take that sherbet out and serve it the way you should.
Go on!
Well, let' s see what your aunt has on the menu for tomorrow.
Roast chicken.
Chicken every Sunday.
Your aunt has no imagination.
Oh, I love roast chicken!
I' m glad tomorrow' s Sunday.
You won' t be so glad.
Well, Sundays around here... give folks sour stomach for the whole rest of the week.
- How come?
- Wait till tomorrow.
You' il find out soon enough.
Death comes unexpectedly!
And the god, Jehovah, will execute his vengeance on ye... who despise his dying love and trample his benefits underfoot.
The unconverted soul, the foolish children of man... do miserably delude themselves in the false confidence... of their own strength and wisdom.
But bear testament.
Death comes unexpectedly!
Now, you say, "Ah, no.
I thought my scheme good.
like a thief, outwitting me, too quick for me.
Oh, cursed foolishness, that I had flattered and pleased myself... with vain dreams of repentance.
And now he will deal with you.
Now, the great king of heaven and earth... will abolish and annihilate this pride!
Will crush the hardened wretch of the polluted, infinite abomination... and rain on him... a deluge of fire and brimstone!
Where are the great leviathans who defy God then?
Where' s their courage, these- these -- these- these proud spirits?
Yes... death comes unexpectedly.
And the dread judge has the key of hell.
He shuts, and no man opens.
In hell... you will be reserved in chains of darkness forever and ever.
This place of atonement, of damned souls and misery... with nothing to relieve you, no comfort... no water for your parched tongues... no place to rest or take a breath... but the everlasting, infinite convulsions of misery... forever... and ever and ever!
Now, Isaiah has warned us... on the day of vengeance, the earth shall be laid to waste.
And the cormorant and the bittern shall possess the land.
The raven and screech owl shall dwell in it.
- Don' t stare at the orphans, Pollyanna.
- And who is man... to think he can withstand God' s mighty wrath?
Great mountains cannot stand before this wrath.
Yea, he can lay the earth to pieces in one moment... or shatter the whole universe with one stroke of his fiery sword.
How dreadful is the state of those who are in daily danger... of this great wrath... this abyss of death and despair.
Yet, this is the dismal case... of every soul in this congregation who has not been born again... however moral or strict, sober and religious you may otherwise be.
There is no security for the wicked... because there are no visible signs of death at hand!
Unconverted men... walk over the pit of hell on a rotten covering.
And these places cannot be seen.
God has many different unsearchable ways of taking the wicked from this world.
Who here, in this congregation, listening to this discourse... will soon be visited by this covenant of darkness?
There you are, sitting there... calm in your knowledge of health, secure in your well- being.
Yes, even today or maybe the next hour... the next minute.
And if we were to know which of you it was... what an awful sight it would be.
A soul doomed... to the everlasting bottomless pit of a divine wrath!
Yes... death comes unexpectedly!
Amen.
Exactly!
I thought the reference to Jeremiah at the finish was very effective.
- Didn' t you, Mrs Ford?
I, uh, sometimes wonder whether it' s necessary... to talk so furiously at them though.
Dear, Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel... were all recorded with flaming pens and fire.
I- I can' t deliver the message with syrup.
Your voice is God' s instrument.
- It should be used accordingly.
- Well, we try our best.
What' d I tell ya?
He sure sermonizes something fierce, doesn' t he?
Brimstone and damnation on top of ham and eggs!
- The one day a week we have off.
- I hate Sundays.
- Ooh, I just hate them.
- Breakfast still a hot ball in our stomachs... and him chewing our ears off from that pulpit!
We' re gonna have roast chicken though.
I' m glad of that.
Glad this, glad that!
What is all this "glad" business you talk about?
Oh, just a game I play.
What kind of a game?
A game my father taught me.
- It helps sometimes.
- Helps what?
When things aren' t going so well.
- That reverend!
Go away.
Folks just hate the coming of Sunday because of him.
Do you know why I hate Sunday?
Because it means the starting of another week.
- That' s true.
- That' s when you can play the glad game.
Here it comes.
Miss Goody Two- Shoes is gonna find something about Sunday to be glad about!
- Oh, lay off her, Angie.
- Oh, stop it!
If you knew how to play the game, then you could find something to be glad about too.
But you don' t!
All right, Miss Smartie- Pants, what' s so good about Sunday?
- Huh!
You could be glad because --
Well, because what?
Because it will be six whole days before Sunday comes around again, huh?
That kid.
Hi.
Why don' t you come out of the front door like normal people?
They won' t let us.
I can come out anytime I want with my tree.
You can also fall and hurt yourself badly.
You shouldn' t play in trees.
That' s stupid.
Don' t you believe in God?
Of course I do!
But what' s that got to do with it?
He grew it there, didn' t he, so I could climb out anytime I want.
You' re much too young to go around discussing things you don' t know anything about.
Why else would it be there?
Shows you' re very juvenile.
You aren' t so much, you girl!
I' m an orphan.
Go away from me, please, little boy.
"Go away from me, please, little boy."
What is it you want?
I wanna go fishin '.
You wanna come along?
Aren' t you supposed to use a hook?
I don' t have a hook.
Hello.
- Well, look who' s here.
- Fine, thank you.
- Caught anything?
- Not yet.
What was it you and my Aunt Polly fought about?
Now, where did you hear about that?
But they won' t discuss it when I' m there.
Um, would you mind telling me what it was?
Well, Pollyanna, it' s a strange thing about arguments.
But now --
You know, I can' t even remember what it was about.
Aunt Polly' s very pretty.
Yes, I think she is, don' t you?
Yes.
I just said so.
I love her, but I don' t love the way she fixes her hair.
Years ago, she used to wear it long and soft down to her shoulders.
It was very soft.
It must' ve been beautiful.
Yes, it was very beautiful.
Did you used to be in love with her?
Come on, Pollyanna.
Let' s go!
Reverend Ford and his wife are with Aunt Polly now.
But they' il -- they' il be leaving soon.
I suppose Aunt Polly will be alone by herself most of the afternoon.
Well, I- I' d better be going now.
Good- bye.
- You wanna know something?
- What?
Trees are the best things in the world.
You can hide up in 'em and people don' t even know where you are.
- And they' re walking right beneath you.
- I never thought much about it.
Well, they are.
You wanna see something?
- What?
- Come on.
I' il show ya.
- It says, "Keep out."
- Shh!
Ya gotta keep quiet.
- What about it?
That' s Old Man Pendergast' s place.
He' s the meanest man in town!
- Well, what are we doing here?
Keep quiet.
Come on, Pollyanna.
This is his old, wet basement with rats in it.
He hates kids.
If he catches ya... he throws ya down in his basement and keeps ya for his slave.
- Then what are we doing here?
- Because I wanna show ya something.
There it is.
Up there.
The best climbing tree in town!
Isn' t it a beauty?
Why, of all the stupid little juvenile tricks!
Do you mean to tell me that you brought me all the way up here... just to see a crummy old -- a crummy old tree?
Wait a minute, Pollyanna.
Don' t you even want to climb it?
- No.
- Well, would ya give me a boost?
Aw, come on.
Please?
All right.
More.
Higher.
A little bit higher.
Just a little bit more.
- What are you doing here?
- Look out!
I' ve gotcha!
Come back here, you little girl!
You wicked little boy.
- Lemme go, lemme go!
- Shut up!
I' il teach you.
Come here.
I want you children to understand that I do not want you on my property.
- Hey!
- I' ve told you 50 times to keep out of that tree!
- Lemme go!
You hear me?
You keep away from me.
I wasn' t hurtin 'anything.
You came back, did you?
Who are you?
My Aunt Polly will send for the police.
And they' il find us in your old rat- filled basement and you' il go to jail.
Oh, they know about me, do they?
Everything!
All about the children you' ve kidnapped and turned into your slaves.
- Serves' em right for trespassing on my property.
- We weren' t hurting anything.
We just wanna climb your old tree.
You fall out of that tree and get hurt and I get sued by your parents.
I don' t got any parents.
I' m an orphan.
Well, before I pitch you into the basement with the others...
- what name do you go by, boy?
- Jimmy Bean.
I like to keep a record of your names, you see, Jimmy... so that I can tell you from the rats down there in the basement.
- Hey!
Come back here, doggone you!
You come back here.
What am I going to do with you, huh?
I don' t know, sir.
Well, it was getting too crowded with kids in that basement anyway.
All right.
I' il let you go this time... but you' ve got to promise never to come bothering me here again.
- You promise?
- Yes, sir.
Cross your heart and hope to die?
All right.
Get out.
Get out!
What are you waiting for?
- You know what I think?
What do you think?
I don' t think there' s any kids in your old basement.
- I think you' re just a big bluff!
- Oh, you do, do you?
Well, put that down!
What are you doing touching things?
Don' t touch anything.
These are my things and I don' t want them touched.
It just looks like a lotta old dusty junk to me.
You' re nothing but a child.
Imagine criticizing a beautiful antique of this kind.
- How' d you do that?
What are you talking about?
That.
How do you make it?
Don' t you know anything?
The sun made it.
- That' s prismatic reflected light.
- Where from?
Well, uh --
Oh, from here.
- You see these hanging crystals?
- Mm- hmm.
The sun' s rays hit it, and it acts like a prism.
You understand?
- Sure I understand.
- You do not.
Now, admit it.
It makes a rainbow right on your wall.
Isn' t it beautiful?
So stop carrying on so.
Sure, but it' il be back again tomorrow when the sun comes again.
- You have to admit that.
- I don' t have to admit anything!
Well, I better be going back home now.
Well, goodbye, Mr Pendergast.
It was very nice meeting you.
And thank you for showing me your house.
But I didn' t show you my house.
You came barging in here!
Goodbye.
Kids today.
Well, you always were unpredictable, Edmond.
- Hello, Polly.
- Coming here like this without even calling.
Uh, won' t you sit down?
- Could I get you some sherry?
- Uh, no, thank you.
I ran into your niece down at Wompus Creek.
We were talking about you and I thought, why not stop by and say hello.
Why, that' s very nice.
I don' t know why Pollyanna would be at Wompus Creek.
Oh, she was playing.
There were so many people around the other day, we hardly had a chance to talk.
Yes, well, I' m sorry that meeting got out of hand like that.
Well, tell me, who have you seen since you' ve been back?
- You knew that Carleen Donnelly got married, didn' t you?
- No.
- You remember her brother, Beckett Donnelly?
You two used to argue all the time.
Well, I' m sorry, I don' t.
Well, it really wasn' t that important.
I know what I' il do.
I' il give you a welcoming home party.
It might be nice to see some of the old faces again.
I know that Gary and Nell would love to see you.
Do you know that Nell has eight children?
And I think it' s the fifth one --
- Polly?
- What?
I' m not very good at parties.
Please don' t.
Well, I just thought you might like to see some of your friends.
I came back to see you.
Well, that' s very flattering.
A busy person like you remembering me.
I came back to see if you were married and what had happened to you.
Oh, I' m just the same.
- Nothing has changed.
Everything is -- - We made a mistake.
I came back to see if you felt the same as I do.
Oh, but it' s been five years.
- You can' t just pop out -- - They were wasted years.
Tell me about your work, Edmond.
We' ve heard that you' ve opened a clinic in Baltimore... and we' re very proud of you.
- What was it you mentioned yesterday about the orphanage?
- I don' t remember.
Oh, yes, you do.
It was something about the dispensary.
It' s inadequate for that number of children.
That' s all.
Well, I want to modernize it.
Will you help us?
Just tell us what we need and I' il buy it.
It' s a civic responsibility.
Why should you buy it?
- Well, it isn' t as if I couldn' t afford it.
- What does that have to do with it?
Well, it' s because I want to.
I feel I should.
After all, there is an obligation to having wealth.
Haven' t you learned yet that people don' t like false charity?
Well, I don' t want to talk about it any more.
I don' t know how we got off on this subject.
Well, it isn' t the way I wanted it.
- Perhaps I should come again another time.
- Yes, perhaps you should.
And maybe you should call first?
Yes, I' il do that.
Pollyanna, look at your new dress.
And your shoes!
Oh, I' m sorry, Aunt Polly.
I was playing, and I didn' t realise.
What were you and Dr Chilton talking about?
Oh!
Nothing.
We were talking about your hair.
- My hair?
- Yes.
He said you used to wear it very long and soft, down to your shoulders.
He said it was beautiful!
Yes, well, uh -- Clean yourself up for supper, dear.
Yes, Aunt Polly.
Here is the last of the calf' s- foot jelly.
- Oh, but Aunt Polly, please -- - There' il be no nonsense about it, Pollyanna.
This is a duty and a job that must be done.
Nancy will show you where the deliveries are supposed to be made.
- What kind of deliveries?
- Charity baskets, child.
- Dwell on it.
Appreciate how lucky you are.
Now, these two go first, Nancy, and handle them with care.
- Oh.
- Yes, ma' am.
And keep your clothes clean for a change.
Off with you.
- Come on, honey.
We' ve got three more to go!
- Oh, just a minute, Nancy.
What' s in the durn thing?
Um, I think that one' s calfs' - foot jelly.
Oh, you don' t have to look at it as though it was charity... just a gift from one friend to another.
- Friend?
- Yes.
I' m your friend.
Well, uh, I better be going now.
- People sure hate to get charity.
- Isn' t it the truth?
Ha!
- Goodbye, Miss Ferd.
- Goodbye.
- Now, how does that go again?
That takes care of Mrs Gaupherson, Miss Neely...
Doppsils and the Ferds.
- Who' s left?
- Just this one, Mrs Snow.
- And I wish this one were over with.
- What' s wrong with her?
She' s just plain crabby, that' s what' s wrong with her.
You never met anyone so cantankerous.
If it was Friday, she' d wish it was Tuesday.
- What' d we bring her today?
- Uh, calfs' - foot jelly.
You wait and see.
She' s bound to wish she had chicken.
And if we brought her chicken, she' d want lamb broth.
She' s just cantankerous!
Millie?
Nancy, come on in.
- Hello, there.
- Uh, this is Pollyanna Whittier.
I heard you were coming to stay with your aunt.
- And this is Mrs Snow' s daughter, Mildred.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- Where were you last night?
We waited and waited.
My mother said I could go and at the last minute changed her mind.
Stop that noise in there!
Haven' t you any respect for a dying woman?
Honestly!
I' m just worn to a frazzle!
She didn' t want coffee this morning.
- This morning she wanted tea.
I swear!
I had to make her a new cup of tea.
Hello.
Who are you?
And what are you doing in my bedroom?
- Uh, I am Pollyanna Whittier.
- Who?
- Oh!
- The ladies' aid has sent me with this.
What is it?
- Calfs' - foot jelly.
Oh!
And I had my heart set on lamb' s broth today.
- You mean chicken, don' t you?
- What' s that?
Well, they tell me you always wanted chicken when you were brought jelly.
You' re a Miss Impertinence, aren' t ya?
Come here.
Come right over here.
You have a stubby little nose.
What do you think about that?
I know it.
I wish I were pretty like you.
Oh, don' t you try to butter me up.
- I' m not at all pretty.
- Oh, but you are!
And you don' t look sick at all.
Well, that shows you what a stupid little girl you are.
Well, get outta my way.
Why, I' m right on death' s doorstep... just hanging on by sheer will power.
Put that down, stop it.
And the doctor, all he gives you is pills.
Pills and bills.
Just pills and bills.
That' s all.
- What are you staring at?
- Your prisms.
- My what?
- Your prisms.
- Oh.
See?
On that wall over there.
How' d you do that?
- Well, I said that I' m too old and too smart for that old saw, Fred Pallegrew.
- Well, I should say so!
You just turn that horse around and head out from underneath this covered bridge right now.
- You should' ve seen his face.
- More coffee?
- Oh, please.
- It' s awful quiet in there.
- I wonder what' s going on.
Uh, more to your left.
To your left, you silly girl.
What' s the matter with you?
Now, there.
That' s not bad at all.
Not bad?
It' s gorgeous!
- I think it was a fine idea.
- Now, don' t be taking credit.
I suggested stringing them up there.
Why, Mrs Snow, that' s a fib.
It was my idea.
It was my idea to use the string!
You didn' t know how to do it till I suggested the string.
You' re impertinent.
I don' t like you at all.
I' m sorry.
When are you coming back again?
I' il see you then.
Well, if I' m not in my grave.
- Bye.
- Bye.
All right, Nancy?
- Goodbye, Millie.
- Goodbye, Nancy.
- Goodbye, Pollyanna!
Don' t stand there!
Go on and fix a cold pack for my headache!
Go on!
Go on!
Yes, Mother.
Let' s get some gumption around here.
Let' s start acting like a community.
Hey, Doc, you just sit there chewing on that straw.
What do you think?
I came here to fish, Charlie.
I don' t want to butt into your affairs here.
Ben Tarbell?
Where are you sneaking off to?
You folks are biting off a pretty big chew with all this talk.
Get it said.
A lot of us have got vested interests in the Harrington companies.
Our wives belong to her ladies' aid group.
My woman would skin me alive if I was to go opposite to Polly Harrington.
And that' s the truth!
Anybody else want to quit, do it now.
Let' s get our hands out of our hip pockets... and find a way to raise some money.
- Are you with me?
- Yeah.
What' s happening?
Now, that' s the very first thing in the morning.
Charlie Gorman... that means eight men assigned to you for carpentry.
- Dan Seymour' il supply the one- by- twelves.
- Right.
All right.
Now, look, Mary, you gotta get that cooking done.
- Yes, Karl, I' il take care of the chicken.
- Hi.
I' il be back in a minute.
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.
What' s going on?
Lady, you are looking at the elected head of the entertainment committee.
Old Uncle George!
- Entertainment committee for what?
If we get the corn, you can take that whole thing out of there.
Charlie, you can count on me to haul in that lumber.
- Don' t have to use the big truck -- - We' re gonna have the best bazaar you' ve ever seen.
We sure are!
- A bazaar?
- To raise money for a new orphanage.
It' s the first time folks have stood together against Polly Harrington.
- Nancy, did you know there' s going to be a bazaar?
With corn on the cob and ice cream and everything!
Can they come?
- Well, of course they --
- George?
Now, where' d you get that name?
- Oh, stop.
She' s known it all along.
And you mean you didn' t tell your aunt?
- Well, what did you think I was, a snitch- baby?
- You' re a good girl.
- When' s it gonna be?
- Sunday night, a week.
Let me tell you about it.
An extravaganza.
And I' m in charge of all the acts, all the entertainment.
Picture it, ladies.
Darkness, and out of the night... 50 bicycles appear, moving down the square.
And hanging from their handlebars... 200 -- 200 gorgeous Japanese lanterns.
Hey, Pollyanna, wait for me.
- Where are you goin '?
- There' s a big bazaar and I' m helping.
Hey, wait a minute.
- What' s it for?
- It' s an extravaganza.
Picture it.
Darkness... fifty bicycles... 200 gorgeous Japanese lanterns swinging.
And I' il be on the lead bicycle, just riding along, right out in front.
- Oh, boy.
Can I help?
- All right.
Come on.
- Where you goin 'now?
- Mr Pendergast' s.
You' re going back?
You' re nutty!
- What are you doing back here?
- Oh, just came to say hello.
- Tell you something about your prisms.
- Well, what about them?
- Well, aren' t you going to invite me in?
- Invite you in?
No more privacy than a goldfish.
But you can' t stay long.
Can he come in too?
- Can who come in?
- Jimmy Bean!
Come on.
Don' t be a scare- baby!
Oh, come on!
Don' t touch anything.
Well, why didn' t you just invite the whole town while you were at it?
Oh, I just wanted to show Jimmy the rainbow on your wall.
Do you mind?
All right.
Go ahead, go ahead.
Kids -- They' il drive you crazy.
One thing or another.
Through this piece of glass.
- Explain it to him, Mr Pendergast.
- I' ve got work to do.
- Don' t you know anything about refracted light, there, boy?
- It' s the sunlight coming through --
I' il do the explaining if you don' t mind, little Miss Know- it- all.
Now, boy, you see here, the --
- Don' t they ever cut your hair in that darn orphanage?
- I like it the way it is.
Look at you.
So much hair, you look like you' re wearing a coonskin cap.
- Lemme go, will ya?
- Anyway... about the refracted light.
Oh yes.
Now pay attention, boy.
You see the shape of this crystal?
That is a prism.
That refracts the ray... splits the colours, diffuses them in an oblique angle... and bends it out into a dispersed colour band.
You understand?
What he means is... the sun comes through here and paints a rainbow.
- You see?
- Oh, I understand!
Can I try it once, please?
Go ahead, but don' t break anything.
Do you know Mrs Snow?
And we strung a whole bunch of them up across her window.
You should see what that does!
- Let' s try it.
- All right.
Oh no, I' ve got work to do.
If we had some wire or a piece of thread... we could string 'em up across the whole window.
Oh, we could, could we?
I' ve got nothing better to do than to play silly games?
Well, don' t stand there looking at me like that.
There' s string in that box over there.
Go and get it, go and get it.
Oh, dear, dear, dear.
Oh, my goodness!
Look!
See over here?
- Look on the door!
- It' s on the door.
- Look!
Oh, it' s gorgeous!
It' s the most beautiful room in the entire world.
Not bad, is it?
It' s not bad at all.
That dining room looks awfully gloomy.
Why don' t we do the same thing in there?
- Oh, boy!
Let' s go!
What do you mean, "no"?
I thought you enjoyed it.
Well, it' s what I came to see you about, Mr Pendergast.
You see, they' re having a big bazaar in town... and they' re trying to raise enough money to build a new orphanage.
- I like the old one.
- Be still.
Anyway, they need help.
And everyone' s supposed to bring somebody else.
And I want to bring you.
- What for?
- They' re having all kinds of stands to sell things -- hooked rugs, quilts and crocheted tablecloths.
And we can have a stand and sell these!
Rainbow makers!
I' il bet everyone would buy one.
I never go into town, and I don' t believe in community projects.
- But they need you!
- They need me?
Of course, they are sort of attractive little things, aren' t they?
I just wonder if folks would buy a thing like this.
I wonder.
Now, I' m not trying to sell you the brass, but it is durable.
Well, the silver' s pretty, and I think you' re right about the brass.
Oh, I don' t know.
I just can' t make up my mind.
Of course, the effect of silver is always in good taste.
- Hi, Mrs Snow.
- Well, where have you been, you naughty girl?
- Oh, I' m sorry.
I' ve been helping for the bazaar.
Hello, Mr Murg.
- How do you do?
What' ve you got there?
Get them off my bed!
They' re patchwork squares.
Mrs Gaupherson made them.
I thought perhaps you' d like to stitch them together... to make a patchwork quilt for the bazaar.
- What an impertinent child!
- Listen.
You just take them right out of here!
- I' m not gonna do anything of the sort!
Mr Neely, the Julians, and even old Mrs Thurm.
She wants me to work in my condition.
Don' t bother Mrs Snow, girl.
She' s a very sick woman!
I mean, the bazaar' s for an awfully good cause.
Well, it' s a waste of time.
Nobody' il come to it.
You wait and see.
- That' s right.
- Why not?
Because -- Because of your aunt, that' s why not.
Well, I don' t understand.
Well, we do, don' t we, Mr Murg?
Well.
I think it' s lovely.
- This- This is my first choice.
- And I think the best one.
- It' il look lovely against the brass handles.
Are you having a dress made?
Don' t be impertinent!
I' m pickin 'the lining for my coffin.
That' s right.
But you' re not gonna die!
Does she have to be here?
Go on into the kitchen and talk to Mildred.
Now, this satin is lovely.
Well, it' s all settled then.
And the brass coffin handles.
Well, all right, all right.
Write it up.
Stop frowning at me like that!
What' s the matter with you?
Well, it' s just that... well, a person shouldn' t think about dying so much!
- I don' t want you to die.
- Oh, bless you for that.
It seems everyone else can' t wait.
I' m not supposed to talk about my father at home... but I guess it' s all right here.
My father used to say, a person should think about living.
Why don' t you go outside and play?
- Hush up.
I want to hear what she has to say.
Mrs Snow.
It just reminded me about my father and the doll.
My father was a minister.
But surely he could afford a little thing like a doll.
Well, he couldn' t.
We had to have the money for food.
- Oh, for heaven' s sake!
- Shh!
So anyway, my father wrote to the missionary people... and asked them to please send a little secondhand doll.
When the missionary barrels came... instead of a doll, they sent a pair of crutches.
Well, of course, I was rather disappointed.
- So my father made up the glad game.
- The what game?
She' s been pestering folks all over town with this sunshine and happiness thing.
Hearts and flowers.
Enough to make you sick.
- Hush up!
I want to hear it.
- Certainly.
Anyway, about the crutches... my father said, "Don' t let' s be gloomy.
Let' s try to find something to be glad about. "
So we made a game of it -- the glad game!
- "The glad game"!
- Shh!
So anyway, we played the game... and after a while I forgot about the doll and being gloomy.
And you know what?
I found a reason for being glad.
Well, there' s nothing happy about a pair of crutches.
Well, we were glad that we didn' t have to use them!
Why must you bedevil this poor dying woman... with your childish, silly little stories?
I just thought she could play the game!
You could be glad you don' t need this horrid old coffin!
You could help others by making the patchwork quilt for the orphans if you wanted.
You ought to forget about dying and be glad you' re living!
Oh, I don' t care what you do.
I' m not gonna come and see you any more.
I -- I didn' t mean to hurt her feelings.
- She' s serious about it, isn' t she?
- Oh, please, please, Mr Murg.
Leave me alone.
- I' m sorry if I' ve -- - Please.
Please leave me alone.
Ben told me yesterday they' ve been organizing, about 50 of them.
- And Ed Chilton' s got a finger in the pie too!
Gave them the idea is what he did.
And that' s not all.
- It couldn' t have been Nancy.
- I tell you, she was there.
I' d fire that girl so fast, it would make her head swim.
And that child, your own niece, helping them!
Pollyanna?
Just a moment.
Mrs Tarbell tells me you' re involved with that bazaar.
Well, I won' t have it.
But, Aunt Polly, I' m part of the flag.
We won' t discuss it.
I don' t want you to see those people any more... and that' s an order!
Yes, ma' am.
The blessings you' ve heaped on that child, and her working with those people against you.
Get down my cake tins, Angie.
We' re going to work.
- Doin 'what?
- Thinks she' s the queen of Sheba, does she?
Well, she can' t stop us from helping with that bazaar!
We' re gonna bake cakes, dozens and dozens of' em!
- Where are you gonna get the ingredients?
- Where do you think?
- You' re getting paid, aren' t you?
- Not to be kicked.
He kicked me in the stomach.
Now, Jimmy, you' ve got to stop kicking Mr Hooper and sit still.
- I don' t want to get my hair cut!
- Hey, Jed.
Get that hammer out back, and we' il nail his shoes to the chair!
You should be ashamed of yourself, Ben Tarbell!
I paid for the tickets.
I just can' t show up at your affair.
- You ain' t the only one, Ben.
- What do you mean by that?
Well, I just came from your newspaper office.
What' s the matter with those fellows?
They said they couldn' t handle this ad for our bazaar.
Will you go over and straighten them out?
Ah, take it easy, Doc.
Our space is all sold, and I can' t go around --
Tell him the truth.
You' re a coward!
It isn' t Baltimore up here, Doc.
This is a small town.
And you know as well as everybody else our newspaper' s owned by the Harrington family.
That' s what you all are.
Well, take it easy, Pendergast.
It' s the way things are.
And I' m sick and tired of --
Just a minute! Just a minute!
Most folks around here make a living outta Polly Harrington, some way or another.
- Can' t afford to antagonize her?
Just don' t be surprised if come Sunday night nobody shows up at your bazaar.
I don' t believe that.
Well, you' re comin ', aren' t ya?
Charlie?
People are just plain scared to, Karl.
They' re afraid of Polly Harrington paying 'em back later.
- She' il do it too.
- Now, look.
We' ve all taken a cut or two at the Harringtons... but she wouldn' t do a thing like that.
- If you think I' m intimidating a whole town -- - Oh, Polly, you know what I mean.
No one will make a move in this town without the Harrington stamp of approval on it.
Karl Warren sent you, didn' t he?
He knew no one would cooperate without me.
Nobody sent me.
I just wanted it made clear you don' t mind if the others cooperate.
You needed my help.
Why don' t you admit it?
Won' t let your guard down for a minute, will you?
Still suspicious.
Still don' t trust anyone.
Nothing' s changed, has it, Polly?
You' re still as opinionated as ever, if that' s what you mean.
Oh, Angelica...
Dr Chilton is leaving.
Keep busy, Polly.
Lots of meetings and civic duties and obligations.
I knew I could count on you for some lofty clinical observations.
Would you like to be paid for your diagnosis?
This one' s on the house.
There' s no medical term for it.
It' s as simple as that.
- Ma' am?
See that the flowers in the conservatory get fresh water.
- I found them dry again today.
- Yes, ma' am.
Did ya hear how he told her off?
Like water off a duck' s back to her.
That woman' s got no feelings at all!
- How' d it go, Ed?
- Stubborn, mule- headed woman. Just like her father.
I should have known better.
- What did she say?
- A lot of foolish nonsense.
What she really wants is for us to go begging to her... get her sanction, permission from the queen to gather in the streets.
- Hi, Nancy.
- Hi, dear.
- What' s the matter?
- Oh, nothing.
- It' s a doggone shame, after all the work folks put into it.
- Is the bazaar off?
- It looks that way.
- Why?
- You wouldn' t understand.
- Is it because of Aunt Polly?
It takes a word from someone, someone who isn' t under her thumb.
Fat change you got, Ed.
She' s got her finger in nearly everything -- the bank, the mills, the paper, real estate.
Harrington Town.
A fine thing, one woman owning a town.
Well, like it or not, that' s what she does.
- Nancy.
- Yes?
- She doesn' t own the church.
That' s right.
What did you say?
Um, I just said that nobody could own a church.
Our social structure in this small town seems to teeter on a delicate balance... one which -- which I certainly cannot in any way attempt to influence.
A- A man of God cannot be taking sides in these feuds.
- But all we want is a word from you, Reverend.
- No, no, no.
I won' t use that pulpit for public announcements.
- Then you' re siding with her by not mentioning it.
- I am not!
I' m staying completely out of it, and that' s all there is to it.
Reverend Ford, if you' d just let us say that you' re in favour.
There' s nothing more to discuss.
- This is all just impossible.
- I' m afraid you' re right.
Thank you, Reverend Ford.
You see, I -- Of course, you understand that --
Personally I think it' s a good cause and all that, and- and I wish you luck with it.
Thanks a lot.
I guess Pollyanna was wrong.
Now, what has she got to do with this?
She said nobody could own a church.
- Hello, Mrs Ford.
- Hello, dear.
What are you doing here?
Uh, something for Reverend Ford.
- Oh, he' s just back up there.
- Oh, yes, I saw him.
- It' s a lovely day, isn' t it?
- Yes, it is.
And he sayeth unto them... the wicked shall be punished.
The wicked shall be punished.
But they shall feel the gall of asps within them.
A house divided against itself cannot stand.
A kingdom divided against itself can be brought to desolation.
If you are an enemy to one another... then you are an enemy to God!
Week after week, I stand here reaching out to you... begging you to understand.
Yet, week after week... the same wickedness persists... the same dissension... the same belligerence, the same feuding... until you are ten thousand times... more abominable in the eyes of God... than the most hateful, venomous, violent, vicious --
You!
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, nothing.
Um, I mean, I was looking for you.
Uh, Aunt Polly sent you this.
- Now, what is it?
- Uh, I don' t know.
I' m sorry I disturbed your practise.
- Would you like someone to practise your sermon on?
No, thank you, child.
Uh, Mother and I used to be an audience to my father... when he was practising his sermons.
So he was.
Uh, do you like being a minister?
Do I like being a m --
Now, why would you ask a thing like that?
Oh, the way you looked just then reminded me of my father.
Once I saw him sorta sad like that, and I asked him.
And what did he say?
Oh, said he was glad he was.
Just couldn' t seem to get through to his congregation.
Sounds familiar.
I suppose every minister of God faces the same problem.
Mm, I suppose.
Tell me, did your father ever solve the problem?
Well, he read something one day that he said helped him.
In the Bible?
He wore it always.
"When you look for the bad --"
Ooh!
It always makes me cross- eyed.
May I?
"When you look for the bad in mankind expecting to find it... you surely will.
- Abraham Lincoln. "
- He was the president.
Yes, I know.
But I never heard that before.
Neither had my father.
Anyway, he said it started him thinking.
That' s when we both started searching the Bible for the texts.
The texts?
Yes.
You know.
My father called them "the glad passages."
You know, the happy ones like... um, uh, "Shout for joy"... or "Be glad in the Lord."
You know, like that.
Did you know that?
- No, I didn' t know that.
- Yes, well, there are.
And you know, my father said...
"If God took the trouble to tell us 800 times to be glad and rejoice... he must' ve wanted us to do it."
Oh, I' d better be going now.
I' m sorry I disturbed your practising.
Uh, goodbye.
Goodbye, Reverend Ford.
"Dear Reverend...
I' ve taken the liberty of jotting down a few thoughts... and some text from Matthew... which I thought you might want to use in your sermon tom -- "
Oh, my God.
What have I done?
What have I done?
Dear, are you all right?
Nobody owns a church.
No one.
Ecclesiasticus 30... paragraph 22.
"Gladness of the heart is the life of man."
Ayoung member of our parish pointed out to me... that there are 800 such happy texts in our Bible.
Well, she was wrong.
There are, to be exact...
826.
I know, because I stayed up most of last night counting them.
I intend to read one of them every week.
And that should take us, according to my calculations, through 1 6 years... if I' m around here that long.
If I am here... our visits with God on Sunday are going to be happier... and more rejoicing too.
But it must be said.
I look out to you now not as my congregation... but as people.
And I say to myself, how sad it is to have missed those four years... four years when we could' ve been friends.
I should have been looking for the good in you.
And I apologize for this.
God is forgiving, but it' s not God' s forgiveness I beg, it is yours.
I' m- I' m not gonna speak about this any more now.
So let' s go outside and enjoy this Sunday for a change.
And while you' re out appreciating the sunlight, just... give a little thought to who' s sending it down to you.
One more thing, please!
Please sit down.
I' m sorry.
And, um, I want to go on record... as being 1 00 percent for it.
So let' s all go out there and have ourselves some fun... because, um... well, if you' re not there --
I' il lam into you something fierce when I get you in here next week!
And you know I can do it too!
- Where' s Pollyanna?
- I don' t know.
I haven' t seen her.
Be careful when you put those in the car.
Keep your fingers outta there.
Nancy?
Angelica?
Where' s Pollyanna, please?
She' s gotta be there.
It' s a big bazaar tonight.
Pollyanna' s gotta be there, or she' il ruin the flag.
Well, Pollyanna is too young to be out alone at night.
- Couldn' t you bring her?
- No, I could not.
Goodnight.
Pollyanna!
What are you doing up here?
You' il fall and kill yourself, you big silly.
You gotta come.
You' il spoil the flag if you don' t show up.
I can' t.
Aunt Polly won' t let me.
Come on.
She' il never know.
Don' t look down.
- I don' t think I want to try it.
Gimme your hand.
Come on.
Easy.
Real slow.
Don' t look down.
- Are you sure it' s safe?
- I' m sure it' s safe.
There you are, folks.
You cannot have finer.
Yes, it is.
- Here you are, lad.
- Thank you very much.
- There you are.
- It looks wonderful!
Hurry, hurry!
- Hello, Mr Howard.
- Reverend Ford, Mrs Ford.
Nice to see ya.
- We have a booth over here.
- There you are, sir.
This beautiful, soon- to- be patented rainbow maker.
Hurry, hurry.
Right this way, ladies and gentlemen.
- Well, we made --
Go and get into your costume now.
And, Jimmy, go have some fun for yourself.
- This way, ladies and gentlemen.
- Oh, that looks delicious, Mrs Litner.
Just pay on the other side.
- Thank you, Mrs Lagerlof.
You' re very welcome.
Pollyanna!
Will you go and get into your costume?
They' re waiting for you.
Now, who do you suppose this is?
- Here.
Now, you can take this and raffle it off.
You finished it.
Oh, it' s gorgeous.
Mrs Snow, it' s beautiful.
Hi, Millie.
Good evening, Mrs Snow.
Listen, honey, you' ve gotta hurry.
They' re waiting for you.
- Uhh, quilt?
- Well, I' il take it to the quilt stand.
- Here.
Run!
A nice, home- made patchwork quilt.
No home is complete without one.
There' s some salt over there.
- Can I have more?
- You finish those first, then you can come back and have some more.
Delicious corn on the cob.
- One.
- Right here.
Pollyanna, will you hurry up?
Everyone else is dressed and waiting for you.
- Oh, come on.
Yes, you' il win yourself a beautiful doll.
A beautiful doll if ya fish in the fishing pond.
All right, step right up here, folks.
- I am not going to budge.
- I' ve had just enough of your nonsense.
You' re going to join in with the others and make this a town, not a dynasty.
Get down out of that car, Amelia.
I' m warning you.
- Good evening, folks.
- Fish and wish for a surprise here, folks.
- Here, honey.
- Oh, thank you.
- Now, you have to think about what you want and wish very hard.
I understand.
- I' m wishing.
- Do you know what you want?
All right.
The young lady' s going down after it.
Step right in there, folks.
Everybody step right up here.
It' s only two cents.
Drop a line and fish for your surprise.
It' s the most exciting game at the bazaar.
Come on, folks.
Get your bamboo pole here.
Two cents!
Looky there!
- The little lady just pulled a beautiful doll for herself.
- Oh, my gosh!
- She' s mine.
Oh, how did they know?
- Right here -- - Step right up -- Well, Reverend.
- No, no.
- I haven' t pitched since my college days.
- Hey, Reverend!
Bet you couldn' t hit the broad side of a barn.
Charley MacAndrews up there?
Hold this.
You' re not gonna hit anything anyhow.
- Buy some corn with the money.
- You know...
I' ve been trying to get you baptised for the past three years.
And he throws!
Look out!
- Oh!
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
The way they bought up those cakes!
It' s a lot of money for that.
- What is it, ma' am?
- I thought I heard something.
Oh, Lord of mercy.
Oh, Angelica, call the doctor quickly.
Oh, my God.
If you don' t mind, I' d like to speak to all of you in the salon for a moment.
Nancy, when Miss Pollyanna feels better...
I want you to move all of my clothes and my personal belongings into the next room.
- Yes, ma' am.
- I want her to stay where she is.
It' s a larger room, and it has a much nicer view.
And it looks as though she' s going to have to remain there for quite some time.
You might as well know that Pollyanna' s legs are paralyzed.
She doesn' t know it yet, and I don' t know exactly how I' m going to tell her.
I just don' t know how I' m going to tell her.
I came as soon as I heard.
Eh, how is the child?
Pollyanna!
Come on down and play!
Pollyanna!
Want to?
- Pollyanna!
Boy, boy.
Stop that, stop that.
Now, you go away from here.
- But I wanna play with Pollyanna.
- Pollyanna can' t play, because she' s had an accident.
Now, you go on home like a good boy.
Hurry up.
Go on.
- God works in ways mysterious to man.
- Don' t speak to me about God!
Say what you think.
I can see it in your eyes.
- They blame me, don' t they?
No, nobody' s blaming you.
I could have been the least bit understanding.
That child lies up there because of me.
- Polly, the mercy of God is forgiving -- - Oh, what kind of a merciful God... could allow a thing like this to happen to a child?
And if he were merciful, why did he let her come to our town?
Let me tell you something, Polly Harrington.
- Sunday a miracle happened in this town.
- Oh, this town!
Yes, this town.
Right out there in that street the people are smiling at one another.
Take a look for yourself.
It' s very contagious.
Just think, Polly.
If she had never come to this town --
We ought to get down on our knees and thank God for sending her to us.
Excuse me, ma' am.
Dr Chilton wants to see you.
Now, you understand everything I told you, don' t you, dear?
- And there' s nothing to be afraid of.
I told Pollyanna about her injury.
Don' t you, dear?
We' re going to take you to Baltimore for an operation so you can walk again.
You hear that, honey?
Why don' t we all cheer up?
Let' s see if we can' t find something to be glad about your staying in bed.
Um, oh, I know.
This way we can all have steak and ice cream.
Did you know that your aunt ordered it for you?
Now you find something to be glad about.
We' il play the game.
Well --
I suppose I could be glad because --
Go ahead, darling.
No.
It was a silly game.
I hate it.
I never want to play it again.
Leave me alone.
Please try to understand, Pollyanna.
You' re such a part of our lives now.
Nancy and Angelica, Mrs Lagerlof.
And I love you as if you were my own little girl.
Won' t you give me that chance?
- Put these in too, Mr Thomas.
- All right.
- And tell Dr Chilton that the car' s all ready.
Yes, we' re leaving immediately on the 1 1: 30 train.
Well, check the arrival schedule.
Make sure we' re met with an ambulance.
I want complete X rays the minute we arrive.
Yes.
Thank you.
- Is the operation dangerous?
- Yes, it' s very delicate.
I need your permission to operate.
Edmond.
There' s something worrying you, and I want to know what it is.
A great deal depends on her.
That' s what' s worrying me.
Edmond.
She' s had a shock.
She' s just learned about her legs.
I can' t have her despondent like this for the operation.
- Well, you have to give her time.
There is no time.
I have to move her, get her into the hospital, and I don' t like it.
What that child needs is a good shot in the arm of hope.
Hope?
And that' s something I never gave her.
We can still give her that love.
You and I together.
Ma' am!
There' s something very peculiar happening outside.
Miss Harrington!
They- They- They' il ruin our flower beds.
- What are you talking about?
- A- A- Across the lawns and the flowers.
Gotta get 'em outta there.
- That' s what I' ve been trying to tell you.
Been trying to tell me what?
Oh, not the begonias!
Them' s Miss Harrington' s favourite flowers.
Go around the other way.
You can go around that tree.
Go around over by the driveway.
Oh, the heck with it.
- What is it you want?
- We don' t want anything.
We just come to say "How' d ya do" to the child... and bring a bit of gladness into her life.
Like she brought into ours, God love her.
We just want her to know she' s got friends, lots of them.
Give her our love and we' il get off your private property, Miss Harrington.
Uh, wait.
Open the doors, Nancy.
Nancy, open the door.
Come in, won' t you?
Nice to see you.
How are you, Mr Neely?
I' m just fine.
How are you today?
Hello.
Won' t you come in?
Oh, what beautiful flowers.
Hello.
Hello.
You have a few callers downstairs, young lady.
- What?
- You gonna greet them with that mopey old face of yours?
I don' t wanna see anyone.
Well, Pollyanna, you' re not gonna have much choice in the matter this time.
- Oh, no, please.
I don' t wanna see anyone.
- Now, just easy.
- You' il be all right, dear.
I know.
- You get well now, you hear?
It' s not charity. Just a gift, eh, from one friend to another.
- Oh, thank you, Mr Neely.
Don' t you worry.
Goodbye, darling.
We' re going to visit you in the hospital.
Hey, Snookie.
Take a look at this, will ya?
Really?
You mean, really?
You did it!
- Oh, Nancy.
It' s gorgeous.
- Isn' t it?
And we' re gonna wait for you.
You' re gonna be my flower girl.
I' m glad you' il be comin 'back to us, darlin'.
And that' s the truth of it.
The house will be miserable without you.
You hurry back to us.
Best wishes, Pollyanna.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Angelica.
Hurry home to us.
What is everybody sniffin 'about?
My goodness.
Think a person couldn' t get well.
- Hi, Mrs Snow.
Bless you, darling.
- I' il see you soon.
- Thank you for coming.
- Ah, it' s all right.
- Goodbye.
- Hello, Pollyanna.
We have a surprise for you.
- Shall we tell her now, Jimmy?
- I' ve been adopted.
Who?
Who do you think?
We' re gonna spend the rest of our lives just hangin 'prisms.
You hurry home and help.
Hello, Mrs Ford.
Hello, Reverend Ford.
We looked for the good in them, and we found it, didn' t we?
Aunt Polly?
- Bye- bye.
- Bye.
Ta- ta.
Bye- bye.

The child is dead.
Then he breathed no more.
The child is dead.
Dead.
The child is dead.
I' m afraid it will kill her.
My God, she wanted a baby so much.
For such a long time.
What can I tell her?
What will I say?
You could adopt a child.
She wanted her own.
If I may suggest, it even resembles...
Your wife need never know.
It would be a blessing to her and to the child.
Are there no relatives?
None.
The mother died, as your own child, in the same moment.
You said it could be ours, but...
On this night, Mr Thorn,
God has given you a son.
Here' s your boy.
Good morning.
Come va?
- What are you doing home so early?
- Just came to start packing.
What?
We can' t waste any time.
We' re leaving in the morning.
Buongiorno, Carlo.
Please, Carlo.
What are you talking about?
I am talking about London.
I am talking about the ambassador to the Court of St James.
- Well, what about him?
- You' re married to him.
I' m what?
I' m appointed ambassador to Great Britain.
I' ve already told them yes.
I loved it the minute I saw it.
Well, it' s a bit much.
Well, nothing' s too much for the wife of the future president of the United States.
You know, you' re pushy.
Wait till you see this.
Now this, they call his day room.
His day room.
So?
How do you like it so far?
To warm it up.
- Couple of books.
Yeah.
- Something in mind, Mr Ambassador?
- Why don' t we have a little look upstairs?
Well, there' s no furniture up there, either.
You know, you could be too sexy for the White House.
- I' m gonna miss you so much.
- I won' t be long.
We don' t have that much to talk about.
Since when did two old college roommates not have much to talk about?
Since one of them assumed the awesome burden of the presidency.
- Well, give my regards to the first lady.
- I' il do my best.
Why don' t you change you mind, fly over with me?
No, I' d better stay here and fool around with Damien.
- Where is he?
- He was right behind us...
Damien?
Oh, my God, Robert.
Damien!
Robert, where could he be?
You little monkey.
Don' t you ever do that again.
There you are.
- Go.
- Hooray.
- Run out of film?
- Just saving a bit for his canonisation.
- How' s that?
- He' s either the heir to the Thorn millions
- or Jesus Christ himself.
- Want a bite, Daddy?
Smile.
A big birthday smile.
Come on.
Smile.
Holly.
- I' il take him, ma' am.
- No, I' il take him.
Come on.
One... two... three...
Let me jump on it, Daddy.
Let me jump on it.
Hold on.
Damien.
Damien, look at me.
I' m over here.
- Damien, I love you.
There' s Nanny.
Look at me, Damien.
It' s all for you.
Oh, my God.
Go, Tom.
- Morning.
Have you read the papers today?
- No, I haven' t.
There was an article on the suicide, your nanny that jumped.
- They say that she left a suicide note, sir.
- Not true.
Mr Ambassador, did you know she was on drugs?
Would you mind?
- Mr Thorn, did she use drugs?
- Not that I know of.
- The article said...
- I don' t care what the article said.
I' m sorry.
I am sorry.
Will you send me a bill for the damage?
No, that' s all right, Mr Ambassador.
Let' s just say you owe me.
Corporal.
OK, outside.
Yes?
- There' s a Father Brennan here to see you.
- Who?
A priest named Father Brennan from Rome.
He says it' s a matter of urgent personal business.
- Never heard of him.
- He says he just needs a minute.
- Something about a hospital.
- Donation time.
- All right, send him in.
- I didn' t know you were such a soft touch.
On that trip to Saudi Arabia, why isn' t it the right time?
Well, it' s personal, Tom.
I just don' t feel like leaving home right now.
Yes, Father?
We haven' t much time.
You must listen to what I have to say.
All right.
What is it?
You must accept Christ as your saviour.
You must accept him now.
Forgive me, but didn' t I understand that you have a matter of urgent personal business?
You must take Communion.
Drink the blood of Christ and eat his flesh.
Only if he is within you can you defeat the son of the devil.
- I see.
- He' s killed once.
He' il kill again.
He' il kill until everything that' s yours is his.
- Father, would you mind...
- Only through Christ can you fight him.
Accept the Lord Jesus.
Drink his blood.
I' ve locked the door, Mr Thorn.
- Yes?
- Would you send for a security guard?
Listen to what I have to say.
Ambassador Thorn?
I was at the hospital, Mr Thorn, the night your son was born.
- I witnessed the birth.
I beg you.
All right.
Stand by.
- What do you want?
- To save you, Mr Thorn.
So Christ will forgive me.
What do you know about my son?
- Everything.
- And what is that?
I saw its mother.
- You saw my wife.
- I saw its mother.
- You' re referring to my wife.
- Its mother, Mr Thorn.
This is blackmail.
What are you trying to say?
His mother was a ja...
- Everything OK?
- You sounded strange.
The door was locked.
- I want this gentleman escorted out of here.
- OK, let' s go.
Accept Christ each day.
Drink his blood.
- Just get him off the grounds.
Come on.
Father.
Thank you.
Come in.
Excuse me.
Mrs. Baylock is here.
She says she' s the new governess.
Well, that' s a start.
Show her in.
Come in, please.
- Ambassador and Mrs. Thorn.
- How do you do?
I know it' s a difficult time for you, so I' il not intrude on your grief.
I' m here to take away some of your troubles and anxieties.
We' il soon help your little boy to forget what' s happened.
I' m afraid, sir, that some of our young nannies, they get homesick, or they have boyfriend problems.
I left all that behind a long time ago.
Well, now, if you’ il let me see your boy?
Yes, of course.
He' s upstairs.
I' il show you where it is.
Let us get acquainted in our own way.
- Oh, no.
Not with me, he won' t be.
- Well, I don' t think...
- I think it' il be fine.
Give it a try.
All right, then.
- Mrs. Horton.
- This way, Mrs. Baylock.
Excuse me.
- I like her.
- She seems all right.
Where' d you find her?
- Where did I find her?
- Yeah.
I didn' t find her.
I assumed you found her.
Round that corner to the right and it' s the door facing you.
- I' il have your things sent up in a moment.
- Thank you.
- Mrs. Baylock.
- Yes, ma' am?
I' m sorry, but we' re a little bit confused.
Why' s that?
- Well, we don' t know how you got here.
- The agency.
- The agency?
- Well, yes.
They read in the paper about the... well, about your first nanny, so they sent you another.
- That' s it.
- I' il call to confirm that.
- Here are my references.
- Thank you very much.
Well, if I could see your boy, now?
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you.
Have no fear, little one.
I am here to protect thee.
- In a minute, Horton, I think.
- Very good, sir.
- Kathy.
- I' m coming.
Mrs. Baylock.
- Mrs. Baylock.
- Yes, ma' am?
- Where' s Damien?
I think he' d rather go to the park.
- The park?
I told you he was going with us.
- He' s too young for church.
- He' il cause a fuss.
- You don' t seem to understand.
It is my wish and my husband' s wish that Damien accompanies us to church.
- Kathy.
- I' il be there in a minute.
Now, please have him dressed at once.
Well, excuse me for speaking my mind, ma' am, but do you really think a five- year- old will understand the goings- on of an Episcopal wedding?
Will you have my son dressed and in the car in five minutes?
Thank you very much.
What' s the matter, Damien?
It' s just a church, that' s all.
What' s the matter?
- Robert.
- Something wrong?
He just seems scared to death.
- Is he ill?
No, he' s just...
No, he' s just trembling all over.
- Mr Ambassador.
Welcome, sir.
- Good morning.
- No!
- Damien.
Damien, stop it.
Damien, stop it.
Damien.
No!
Horton, drive on.
Are you sure that you don' t wanna call a doctor?
No, it' s just a couple of bruises.
It' il be all right in the morning.
No, I mean for Damien.
Oh, no, he' s fine.
He' s sound asleep.
Just to have him examine him.
Well, he' s perfectly all right.
Never been sick a day in his life.
He never has, has he? isn’ t that a little strange?
Is it?
I mean, no measles or mumps or chickenpox.
- Not even a cough or a cold.
I just think it' s a little unusual.
Look, he' s a perfectly healthy boy.
I mean, we have nothing to worry about with him.
Not physically or otherwise.
He just had a bad moment.
You know, like a fright.
Yes?
Is there anything else?
- Nothing, thank you.
Good night.
I think the best thing to do with a bad day like this is end it.
I' m gonna go to bed.
I' il be along soon.
This is the master of the house.
- Sir?
The dog.
- Beautiful, isn' t he?
We found him outside.
- Who gave you permission to bring it in?
I thought we could use a good watchdog, sir.
And Damien loves him.
Gave you a fright, did he, sir?
- Yes.
- Well, you see how good he is.
As a watchdog, I mean.
I think you' il be grateful on your long trips away, sir.
Mrs. Baylock, we don' t need a dog, and if we do, I' il pick him out myself.
- Damien' s taken quite a fancy to him, sir.
- Tomorrow morning you' il call the RSPCA, tell them to collect the dog and find him another home.
You understand?
Sir.
Come on, boy.
Welcome to Windsor Safari Park.
Animal compound to your left.
Parking, for refreshment and zoo area, to your right.
When driving through animal compounds, please keep all car windows closed.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Let' s go see the monkeys, OK?
- Good morning, Horton.
- Good morning, sir.
Baboons bite. keep all car windows closed.
keep all car windows closed.
Baboons are dangerous.
Oh, no.
- All right, Kathy?
- Yeah.
You' re so silent this evening.
Just tired, I guess.
Sorry.
- Damien all right?
- You sure?
- Yes.
If there were anything wrong, you' d tell me, wouldn' t you?
What could be wrong with our child, Robert?
We' re beautiful people, aren' t we?
There is something wrong, isn' t there?
Kathy.
Is it so serious?
Robert, I want...
I need to see a psychiatrist.
I have fears.
I have such fears.
What kind of fears?
If I told you, you' d put me away.
Kathy, I love you.
I love you.
Then help me.
Find me a doctor.
I will.
Of course I will.
Keep that scrum tight.
Get down low.
Let it go.
Let it go.
Bring him down.
Well done.
I don' t know what you' re clapping for.
27- 3?
- Right.
That' il be three quid.
- I thought it was two.
Haven' t you heard, old boy?
Great stuff.
It was a good game.
That' il give me time to make sure everything' s set up.
Tomorrow, half past two, Bishop' s Park.
Five minutes and you' il never see me again.
Your wife is in danger.
She' il die unless you come.
Father.
Thanks again.
Say what you have to say.
"When the Jews return to Zion, and a comet rips the sky, and the Holy Roman Empire rises, then you and I must die."
"From the eternal sea he rises, creating armies on either shore, turning man against his brother, till man exists no more."
- The Book of Revelations predicted it all.
- I' m not here to listen to a sermon.
"It is by means of a human personality entirely in his possession that Satan will wage his last and formidable offence."
- You said that my wife...
- Go to the town of Megiddo in the old city of Jezreel.
There, see the old man Bugenhagen.
- He alone can say how the child must die.
- Look here...
"He who will not be saved by the lamb will be torn by the beast."
Will you stop?
I' m here because you said my wife is in danger.
She is pregnant.
- You' re mistaken.
- He will not allow the child to be born.
- He will kill it while it slumbers in the womb.
- What are you talking about?
Your son, Mr Thorn.
The son of the devil.
He will kill the unborn child, then he will kill your wife, and when he is certain to inherit all that is yours, then, Mr Thorn, he will kill you.
That' s enough!
With your power, he will establish his counterfeit kingdom here, receiving his power directly from Satan.
- You' re insane.
- He must die, Mr Thorn.
You asked for five minutes, and you' ve got five minutes.
Go to the city of Megiddo.
See Bugenhagen before it' s too late.
Now, I' ve heard you.
I want you to hear me.
I never want to see you again.
You' il see me in hell, Mr Thorn.
There will we share out our sentence.
No!
Mrs. Baylock.
- Anything wrong?
- I just can' t stand that noise.
It' s not all that bad.
- Good morning, Damien.
- Good morning, Daddy.
- What are we gonna do?
- Hold my hands.
- Mrs. Baylock.
Yes, ma' am?
- Would you take him out of here, please?
Would you just get him out of here, please?
Yes, ma' am.
Excuse me, sir.
Come along.
Darling, I don' t know what' s the matter with me.
I just don' t seem to be able to...
I don' t know.
Kathy, I love you.
If this is what the doctor' s doing to you, don' t you think it' s time I had a talk with him?
Yes, you should.
There' s something he wants to talk to you about, anyway.
Oh?
Robert, I don' t ever want to have any more children.
All right.
Then you' il agree to an abortion?
I' m pregnant, Robert.
I just found out this morning.
Yes?
Yes, this is he.
Who?
Who?
But...
Hello?
Hello?
Something about the newspapers.
Well, she knew how much you wanted one.
Now she can' t cope.
She searches for reasons that won' t make her feel inadequate.
She has these fantasies.
She fantasises that your child is alien and that your child is evil.
She thinks that the child is evil?
The point is, at this time, another child would be disastrous.
Well, in what way evil?
Now, this is just fantasy.
She also thinks the child isn' t hers.
The most important thing for you to do is to agree to an abortion.
No.
I' d like to know your reason.
It was foretold that this pregnancy would be terminated.
I' m going to fight to see that it' s not.
- Forgive me, Doctor.
- Please don' t leave.
I must get home.
Damien.
No, no, no, no!
No!
Are there any developments on the state of your wife, sir?
- Is there any news, sir?
Doctor?
My name is Becker.
Is she all right?
She' s in there.
Bed by the window.
She has a concussion and a broken humerus, and, well, some internal bleeding.
- Yes.
No.
- Afraid so.
She' s still alive.
And, with proper care, she can still have children.
Robert.
Robert.
Don' t let him kill me.
Don' t let him kill me.
Kathy.
It' s all right.
- Who is this?
- My name is Keith Jennings, sir.
The photographer whose camera got smashed.
Would it be possible to have a word with you at my flat?
- No, it' s not about the camera.
It' s about you, Mr Thorn.
And the death of the priest.
Go on.
Do you notice anything unusual?
Sorry.
At first I thought this was just a fault in the film.
A strange coincidence.
Then it happened again.
Interesting, don' t you think?
- Same thing?
- Only it' s more pronounced and it' s actually making contact with the body.
The rest, of course - history.
I can' t explain it.
That' s why I started digging.
The coroner' s report shows that he was riddled with cancer.
High on morphine most of the time.
Injected himself two or three times a day.
- Apparently, yes.
He said that he wanted to be forgiven by Christ.
- What is it?
- Three sixes.
Six hundred and sixty- six.
- That' s what I thought.
But the biopsy says it' s a birthmark.
The best is yet to come.
Thousands of 'em.
Every inch of wall- space covered, even the windows.
He even needed to be close to his church.
There are 47.
I counted them.
I think he was trying to keep something out, don' t you?
The police thought he was insane.
They let me come here to see if I could find anything.
The first item is a diary.
It' s about you.
What time you left the house, where you went, what restaurants you had your lunch in, what time your speaking engagements were.
The last entry says that he was supposed to have met you in Bishop' s Park.
And that was dated the day he died.
The important items are here.
If we’ re to get to the bottom of this, we' ve got to start here.
This first clipping is from the Astrologer' s Monthly.
A comet changed its shape into a glowing star,
Like the star of Bethlehem 2, 000 years ago.
This one was on the other side of the world, the European continent, five years ago.
6 June, to be exact.
Does that date mean anything to you?
Yes.
Then you' il recollect this other clipping.
It' s a birth announcement from a Rome newspaper.
Also dated 6 June, five years ago.
The day your son was born.
The sixth month, sixth day.
Was your son born at 6am?
The three sixes.
My son is dead.
I don' t know whose son I' m raising.
No.
It' s my problem.
It' s my problem too.
When I came here with the police, I took some photographs.
I happened to catch sight of my own reflection in that mirror.
I know you must think I' m crazy, but I' m so frightened.
Don' t be afraid.
You' il be all right here.
You' il be perfectly all right.
Some all right!
- What about Damien?
- I' il speak to Mrs. Horton.
She' il look after him.
Mrs. Horton?
- Sir.
- Where' s Mrs. Horton?
- No, they' ve gone.
They just got up and went.
They left an address for you to send their last month' s wages to.
Well, didn' t Mrs. Horton say anything?
No.
I can manage.
- Just as you wish, sir.
- And Mrs. Baylock?
Last night, I saw that dog in Damien' s room.
He' s gone now, sir.
They took him away this morning.
No.
This is the right address.
Apparently, there was a terrible fire and the old hospital burned down.
Five years ago.
OK.
But surely the fire didn' t destroy everything.
There must have been some records.
I think everything was destroyed.
- I do not know.
- Sister.
I adopted a child here.
I' m searching for some records of it...
- There was one.
- No, signore.
- It wasn' t an actual adoption.
- You are mistake.
- Wait.
Birth records.
It' s no use.
The fire started in the hall of records in the basement.
Went up like a torch.
Shot up the stairwells.
The third floor became an inferno.
- The maternity wards.
Nothing left but ashes.
- You will excuse me?
- What about the staff?
- Si, some.
There was a tall man, a priest.
Dark eyes.
Piercing eyes.
- He was principale.
- Yes, he was in charge.
Is he...
- Yes, he is alive.
- No.
- Where?
He' s in a monastero in Frosinone.
Many were taken there.
Many die.
Perhaps he is die since, but he lived through the fire.
I remember people say it was un miracolo.
Frosinone?
- Here we are.
- What is it?
- "When the Jews return to Zion..."
- That' s the poem.
"When the Jews return to Zion..."
Yes, that' s here too.
"The shower of stars and the rise of the Roman Empire."
These are supposed to be the events that signal the birth of the Antichrist.
The devil' s child.
It' s making more sense.
The Jews have returned to Zion and there has been a comet.
- Bit of a stretch.
- What about this?
In Revelations it says:
- "He shall rise from the eternal sea."
- That' s the poem again.
"From the eternal sea he rises, creating armies on either shore."
- That was the beginning of it.
- Theologians have interpreted the "eternal sea" as meaning the world of politics, the sea that constantly rages with turmoil and revolution.
So the devil' s child will rise from the world of politics.
Looks like this is as far as we go.
Let' s have a look.
Found him?
His mind is active, but since the fire he' s not made a sound.
We feed him and take care of his needs.
And we pray for his recovery when his penance is completed.
What penance?
"Woe to the shepherd who abandons his sheep."
"May his right arm wither and his right eye lose its sight."
Can you tell us why?
For abandoning Christ.
- How do you know he' s abandoned Christ?
- He told us.
- But he doesn' t speak.
- There is some movement in his left hand.
He was able to write it down.
You will notice the curved line over the head.
This indicates the hood of the monk.
- The three sixes.
- Six is the sign of the devil.
- But why three of them?
- We believe it signifies the diabolical trinity.
- The devil, Antichrist and false prophet.
- Father, Son and Holy Ghost.
For everything holy, there is something unholy.
This is the essence of temptation.
Father Spiletto, my name is Thorn.
There was a child.
I want to know where that child came from.
- I am afraid that...
- You confessed to them.
- What happened?
- Please, signore.
You said you knew its mother.
Where is she now?
- I must insist that you do not...
- I beg you, where is she?
Answer me.
Answer.
Excuse me.
Cervet.
Please, does it mean something to you?
Cerveteri.
It is an old cemetery from Etruscan times.
Cripta Sant 'Angelo.
- It is nothing but ruins.
- Where is this place?
- But there is nothing there.
Only graves.
- Where is it?
You will find it on the map.
It is perhaps 50km north of Rome.
Robert, over here.
Maria Scianna.
My God.
June 6.
Five years ago.
Bambino Scianna.
Infant boy.
Same date.
"In birth and death, the generations embrace."
Is my son buried here?
This woman could be the mother of the child you adopted.
Why here in this terrible place?
- No.
- Oh, my God.
- No.
Let' s get out of here.
If it' s an animal too, then maybe my child is alive somewhere.
They murdered him.
They murdered him as soon as he was born.
Murderers.
Murderers.
Come on.
Robert.
Don' t run.
It' s only the smell of the graves.
Run.
Robert.
- Hello?
- Hello.
Kathy?
Hello, Robert.
Is that you?
I' m so glad you called.
Kathy, darling.
Now, listen to me very carefully.
Do just what I say.
I want you to leave London right now.
- What do you mean, leave London, darling?
- I' ve put through a call to the embassy.
Tom Portman will meet you at the hospital and bring you here to Rome.
What' s wrong?
Just do it.
Get ready to leave.
- Robert, I don' t think I can move very well.
OK.
Yes, all right, I' il try to be ready by the time he gets here.
All right, darling.
Who is that?
Tom?
Is that you?
Yes?
Yes, this is he.
Tom?
Kathy?
I can' t talk now.
Robert.
I found out about the town of Megiddo.
It' s derived from the word "Armageddon".
The end of the world.
It' s underground, about 60 miles south of Jerusalem.
There' s some excavation going on there.
If only you could remember the name of the man you' re supposed to see.
It' s Bugenhagen.
He was an exorcist.
I read about him.
That was his name.
And I remember the poem.
"When the Jews return to Zion, and a comet fills the sky and the Holy Roman Empire rises, then you and I must die."
"From the eternal sea he rises, creating armies on either shore turning man against his brother till man exists no more."
Kathy is dead.
I want Damien to die, too.
Hello, Mr Thorn.
I am Bugenhagen.
- What is this place?
- The city of Jezreel.
Town of Megiddo.
The place where Christianity began.
The little priest - is he dead yet?
Yes.
Yes.
Come along, Mr Thorn.
We had better get to work.
You will excuse us.
This is for Mr Thorn alone.
All right.
It must be done on hallowed ground.
A church.
His blood must be spilled on the altar of God.
This first knife is most important.
It extinguishes physical life and forms the centre of the cross.
The subsequent placings extinguish spiritual life and should radiate outward.
Like this.
Make no mistake.
- Oh, yes.
He bears a birthmark.
A sequence of sixes.
So, says the Bible, do all the apostles of Satan.
- He doesn' t have it.
- He must have it.
I' ve bathed him.
I know every inch of him.
If it is not visible on the body, it will be beneath the hair.
Remove it.
You must be devoid of pity.
- And the woman?
- She is an apostate of hell.
She will die before permitting this.
Look, I want to know what he said.
I' ve a right to know.
Robert, I want to know what he said.
Look, I' m not just some bystander.
- I was the one that found him.
- I' m the one that' s supposed to kill him.
These are knives.
He wants me to stab him.
- It' s not a child.
How can he know that?
Maybe he' s wrong.
It' s insane.
I won' t have anything to do with murdering a little boy.
He' s not responsible.
I won' t do it.
Well, if you don' t do it, I will.
No!
Run.
Run.
No!
Hold it.
- Panda Four to control.
- MP to Panda Four, come in, please.
Panda Four in pursuit.
American Ambassador, white estate car.
Over.
Al.
We' ve got a shout.
I' il be back later, all right?
MP to Zulu Seven.
You are requested assist Panda Four in pursuit of white estate car, north Seven Hills Road.
Possible diplomatic incident.
Zulu Seven to Panda Four.
We have taken over your pursuit.
Over.
Zulu Seven to MP.
Heading west on Old Church Road.
No!
Please, Daddy, no!
- No, Daddy.
No!
- God help me.
Drop.
Drop, or I' il fire.
And so to their final rest do we commit these two and entrust them unto our Lord.
In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.
Amen.
Detail, attention.
Present arms.
Ready, aim, fire.
Ready, aim, fire.
Ready, aim, fire.
When you' re ready to leave, your car is over there.
- In a moment.
Alex.
Tod and George' s dad just called.
He' s picking you up at 3. 30 tomorrow.
The bus leaves the high school for the airport around 5. 00.
How' s my suitcase working out for you?
Mom, you got to leave that on.
The tag made the last flight without the plane crashing... so I figure it' s got to be on or with the bag.
For luck.
Where would you get a nutball idea like that?
I' m still here.
So, seventeen, on the loose... senior trip with your friends in Paris... ten days in the springtime.
Live it up.
You got your whole life ahead of you.
Hitchcock, let me give you a hand with this.
Carter, you dick.
- Schmuck.
- Good one.
- You left this on the bus.
- Thanks.
Come on, let' s get your stuff together.
Hey, Christa.
Hi, Blake.
- What are you doing?
All right.
You guys got everything?
Yeah, Dad, we' re all set.
Does that mean go?
Don' t know.
This is for both of you.
Have a great time.
Thanks, Dad.
- Both of us.
- Let' s go.
- I will.
Didn' t think anything could look worse than my yearbook photo.
How do you think I feel having to look at you?
What the fuck does he want?
The airport does not endorse solicitors.
Death is not the end.
It will be for you if you harass my students.
Hare Rama.
I have to ask you a few questions this evening.
Did you pack your bags yourself?
Have your belongings been in your possession the entire time?
Mr Browning?
Have you received any packages from persons unknown to you?
- Same as your birthday.
September 25.
9. 25.
Your birthday' s the same as your departure time.
Fuck off, dude.
Dick.
Babe.
George, Dad said both of us.
Give me some cash.
Knock it off.
You asshole.
- You' re welcome.
Let' s go take a shit.
- Take a shit by yourself.
Listen, OK?
Take some knowledge.
We' re about to board a seven- hour flight.
The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets.
Say halfway through the flight... your body wants that aeroplane food out.
You got to go torque a wicked cable.
Then directly after you, walks in Christa or Blake.
That reflexive gag at the back of their throat?
Of his 27th year
John Denver.
He left yesterday behind him
Died in a plane crash.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience.
At this time, we would like to begin preboarding... of Volée Air flight 180 to Paris through gate 46.
In the sky
How did we lose him?
Go.
Go.
Go.
That hurt.
That' s a good sign.
Younger, the better.
It' d be a fucked- up God to take down this plane.
A really fucked- up God.
- Hello.
How you doing?
Can you switch seats with Christa?
God, I would, but I got a bladder thing.
It' s a urinary tract infection.
Let' s go ask Alex.
Could you trade seats so Blake and I could sit together?
Please?
You' re so sweet.
Thanks, Alex.
Thank you, Alex.
You' re welcome.
You really think we' d titty- fuck them over Greenland?
Because of you, I got to watch fucking "Stuart Little."
Thank you.
Thanks, man.
That' s great.
Sorry I' m late.
That' s my seat right there.
- Hello?
To properly fasten your seat belts... slide the flat portion into the buckle.
Flight attendants, prepare for departure.
All right.
Whatever.
It' s fine.
It' s OK, honey.
She asked Tod, but he had some medical thing.
Please?
What' s up, dude?
- Is there a problem, sir?
- What' s your fucking problem?
This fucking plane' s going to explode!
- Shut up, Browning.
- You' re so not funny.
- If this is a joke...
- It' s not a joke!
Alex, take it easy.
- Sit down!
- It' s going down!
We' il remove you if this continues.
I' il fucking remove myself!
- That' s my seat.
Everybody in the aisle off the plane.
Just stay where you are.
Sit tight.
This fucking plane is going down!
See how he' s doing.
- Get the fuck off me!
- Let go, jerk.
You got this?
No one gets back on board.
- That' s my call.
- Wait, please!
Please.
You must understand my position.
I do, and I apologize for Alex... but one of us needs to be on that plane.
I cannot let those students go to Paris for ten days...
Sit the fuck down, Carter!
One of you can go on the flight.
Larry.
They' re not taking this well.
The rest can take an 11. 10 flight.
I' il stay.
You know the French thing.
Get on the plane.
It' s fine.
Hi, I was in the bathroom, and the lock was stuck...
Wait, I didn' t fight with anyone!
Thanks.
I called your parents.
Stupid Alex.
Alex, talk to me.
Tell me what happened.
I saw it.
I don' t know.
I saw out my window, I saw the ground.
The left side blows up and the whole plane explodes.
And it was so real, like how everything happens.
Been on a lot of planes that blew up?
You fell asleep.
We get thrown off the plane and blow a half day in Paris?
All because Browning has a bad fucking dream?
Wait!
The plane, it' s going to blow up!
Fuck you, Horton.
The only trip you' re taking is to the fucking hospital!
Get off him!
Alex, stop it!
There they go, here we stay.
You' re paying for my trip.
I wish you were on that plane!
- You fucking prick!
- Shit!
- Call it in!
- Security!
You' re looking at me as if I caused this.
I didn' t cause this.
Are there any survivors?
How should I know?
- He' s not a witch.
I' m Howard Seigel...
National Transportation and Safety Board.
We' ve contacted all your families.
They are on the way.
Is there anyone here who feels they might need... medical attention or spiritual counselling?
What' s going on?
Are there any survivors?
The cause for the explosion is still undetermined.
The Nassau County authorities are on the scene... naval search and rescue en route.
Excuse me.
I' m Agent Weine.
This is Agent Schreck.
We' re with the FBl.
I understand how you all must be feeling... and I know it' s going to be difficult... but we need to ask questions regarding today' s events... while they' re still fresh in your mind.
This will prove invaluable to our rescue attempts... and any potential criminal investigation.
You said, "Listen to me.
"This plane will explode on takeoff."
How did you know that?
This weird feeling.
Did you take any sedatives before boarding?
On board, did you take any sleeping pills... narcotics, hallucinogens?
Do you take any drugs?
I saw it.
I saw it happen.
I saw the plane explode.
Did the weird feelings have anything to do... with your saying you wished Carter Horton was on it... just before it exploded?
Then why' d you say it?
I didn' t really think it was going to happen.
If that' s the case, Alex... why did you really get off the plane?
My brother George... he told me to go keep an eye on Alex.
And so he stayed and...
He told me to get off the plane.
Larry Murnau said I should get back on... but I told him that he should go.
I sent him back on the plane.
All right.
Nobody forced you off the plane.
You said you weren' t friends with those that were... so, Clear, why did you get off the plane?
and I believed him.
Thank you for the ride.
Coast Guard and naval search and rescue efforts... are continuing at this moment... even as jet fuel burns on the ocean' s surface.
Thirty- nine days have passed... since we lost our thirty- nine loved ones... friends, and teachers.
As each day passes... without a determining cause for the accident... we ask ourselves, "Why?"
"Ecclesiastes" tells us...
"or birds trapped in the snare.
I don' t.
All I owe these people is to live my life to the fullest.
Why don' t you stay off the J. D., then?
Don' t you ever fucking tell me what to do.
I control my life, not you.
I' m never going to die.
I took my driver' s test last week at the DMV.
Got a seventy.
It' s the lowest score you can get, but I passed.
The thing is, when I was done with the test... you know the guy that drives with you during the test?
"Young man, you' re going to die at a very young age."
Is that true?
Not now, not here, not ever, Billy.
Fuck.
You scare the hell out of me.
I' m going up.
I don' t want you to take this the wrong way.
I miss you, you know?
Yeah, I miss you, too.
But my father, he doesn' t understand.
Look, when he gets over this thing... you and me, we' il road trip to the city... catch the Yanks.
We' il do that.
Cool.
I better go.
This thing Ms Lewton showed me in class... they' re going to let me read it.
It says what I' m feeling.
Take care, man.
Because of you, I' m still alive.
Thank you.
We say that the hour of death cannot be forecast.
But when we say this... we imagine that the hour is placed... in an obscure and distant future.
It never occurs to us that it has any connection... with the day already begun... or that death could arrive this same afternoon.
This afternoon which is so certain... and which has every hour filled in advance.
What happened?
Where' s Tod?
Get out of here.
- Didn' t you see it?
- What happened?
You caused Tod so much guilt over George... he took his own life.
He wouldn' t do that.
He said we' d be friends again after you got better.
Mr Waggner.
Almost autumn.
It' s only the end of June.
Yeah, but everything' s always in transition.
If you focus, even now, just one week into summer... you can almost feel autumn coming.
I like being able to see the future.
Why were you at Tod' s house last night?
I' ve seen enough TV to know... the FBl doesn' t investigate teen suicides.
They were there last night.
That means, one... they still don' t have a clue what caused the crash.
Two... they haven' t ruled out anything... and the fact seven people got off the plane... is probably weird enough.
Not to mention, one of those people had a vision... of the plane exploding... minutes before it actually did is highly suspicious.
And it doesn' t help that the visionary' s friend... just committed suicide.
Why were you there last night?
You know what this is?
This is a...
This is Springy Head Guy.
It' s you.
Not a likeness.
It' s how you make me feel, Alex.
No.
Like you, the sculpture doesn' t even know... what or why it is.
It' s reluctant to take form... and yet creating an absolute... but incomprehensible attraction.
In four years of high school... we haven' t said one word to each other.
At that moment, on the plane, I felt what you felt.
I didn' t even know where those emotions came from... until you started freaking out.
I didn' t see what you saw, but I felt it.
You can still feel it, can' t you?
Something from that day is still with you.
I know because I can still feel you.
That' s why I was there last night.
I' ve never dealt with death before.
This could all be in our head.
It just feels like it' s all around us.
It?
Of us.
Is that something that you' re feeling?
I don' t know.
I wish I could see him one last time.
Maybe I would know.
Then let' s go see him.
Easy.
Gives me a rush.
This place?
Doing something I' m not supposed to.
Come on.
Hurry up.
- Is that him?
- I think.
Why did they make him up like Michael Jackson?
That' s him.
Whatever it was that made him Tod is definitely gone.
Holy Christ!
Please.
You' il wake the dead.
Why' d his hand do that?
Chemicals.
The vascular flush creates cadaveric spasms.
Look, I' m his friend...
I know who you are.
What are all those tiny marks?
Cuticle lacerations from pulling at the wire.
Pulling at the wire?
If he was pulling at the wire, he didn' t kill himself.
It was an accident.
In death, there are no accidents... no coincidences, no mishaps... and no escapes.
What you have to realize is we' re all just a mouse... a cat has by the tail.
leading to the grave.
Design.
Does that mean if... you figure out the design, you can cheat death?
Alex, you' ve already done that... by walking off the plane.
Your friend' s departure... shows that death has a new design for all of you.
Now you have to figure out... how and when it' s coming back at you.
Play your hunch... if you think you can get away with it.
But remember... the risk of cheating the plan... of disrespecting the design... could incite a fury to terrorize even the Grim Reaper.
And you don' t even want to fuck with that Mack Daddy.
I' m sorry we broke in, and...
No harm, no foul.
I' il see you soon.
The mortician said that death has a design.
I' m talking about omens.
How do we know, that just by sitting here... by sipping this coffee or breathing the air... or even crossing the intersection... we haven' t started in motion... the events that will some day lead to our death... forty years from now, ten years, tomorrow?
We don' t, unless we open ourselves up... to the signs it' s willing to show us.
I don' t understand.
Did you see Tod die?
Did it happen again, like on the plane?
No, it didn' t, but it might as well have.
This is a message from something, Clear... or someone, hinting at a design.
Total bullshit.
You can find death omens anywhere you want to.
So does "choke."
We' il choke to death?
I want to hear you... but we' il go nuts if you start with this shit.
The mortician said that death has a design, right?
Terry, Billy, Mrs Lewton messed up that design?
For whatever reason, I saw death' s plan... and we cheated it.
But what if it was our time?
What if we were not meant to get off that plane?
What if it still is our time?
If it is, then it' s not finished... and we will die.
Now, not later.
Unless we find the patterns and cheat it again.
After hearing you, I do believe... that Tod killed himself.
Baby, come on, not now.
Looks like we have a reunion here.
Let it go.
- Couple weeks.
- That' s too bad.
- Carter, you dick!
Losing our favourite teacher.
Guys, there' s something I need to tell you.
Lived here your whole life, and now she' s gotta move...
We' re in danger!
Enough!
Both of you!
They died, and we lived.
Get over it.
I will not let this plane crash... be the most important thing in my life!
God!
I' m moving on, Carter... and if you want to waste your life... beating the shit out of Alex every time you see him... then you can just drop fucking dead!
Is Alex there?
Hi, Clear.
Yeah, just a minute.
It' s Clear again.
You want to talk to her?
Clear, he' s in the shower.
Can I get him to call you back?
Sure.
Bye.
She' s concerned about you.
I' m concerned about you.
Why won' t you talk to her?
Or to me?
To anyone.
Officials believe deterioration of silicone insulation... on an electrical connector to the scavenger pump... may have leaked combustible fluids.
A spark beneath the coach cabin in the fuselage... may have ignited the fuel line, proceeding to the fuel pump... which would have set off the catastrophic explosion.
The path of the explosion.
First was Tod, then it was Terry.
They' re dying in the order they would' ve died.
That' s death' s design.
Ms Lewton' s next.
I hear the sound of my own voice in my head... saying to Larry Murnau...
You know the whole French thing.
"Get on the plane."
Everything reminds me of that day.
Right.
I' m hoping a change will help.
And everywhere I looked were great memories.
And now all I see is Larry and those kids.
Just looking out my own front yard... makes me feel nothing but fear.
Laura, I' m going to have to call you back.
Right.
This is Valerie Lewton.
I need Agent Schreck.
What are you doing here?
I was just... checking the air in the tyre to make sure it' s safe.
Get in the car.
Put on your seat belt.
I believe that... that Ms Lewton is next.
Next?
Yeah, next, because... there' s this pattern that' s occurring.
A pattern.
You noticed that, too?
Mom' s favourite.
So what about this pattern?
Did you see it in one of your visions?
Did you catch it in some TV static?
I never asked for what happened on the plane.
You guys are going to sit there and make fun of me.
Whatever.
It' s fine.
But I saved six lives on that plane.
Six lives, and everybody in my entire school... thinks I' m a freak.
I' m not suffering from post- traumatic stress.
I don' t have a narcissistic deity complex.
I' m not going Dahmer on you guys.
This just is.
There is a pattern for us all.
There is a pattern for you.
There is a design for everyone, and I don' t know how yet... but I' m going to break this one.
Now...
I know you didn' t blow up the plane.
We were ready to move on... but then the other survivors started to die.
First, your friend Tod... then Terry Chaney, while you were at the scene.
And tonight, we pick you up at Val Lewton' s house.
Nobody has control over life and death... unless they are taking lives and causing death.
Can you promise me no one else is going to die?
No, I can' t.
As long as I' m in here, it' s out of my control.
I' m sorry.
Go ahead.
Get out of here.
Thank you.
That kid gives me the creeps.
What do we do?
We got nothing.
That' s not what I' m talking about.
There were a couple of moments... where I almost believed him.
Don' t take this the wrong way... but sometimes you give me the creeps.
You' ve got to stop this.
It' s a stupid mug.
You' re out of here.
Pretty soon you' il be gone.
You' il be gone.
All right, just stay still, OK?
Oh, God, Ms Lewton.
Dude.
I don' t know where he is.
He' s not talking to me.
Why?
Because I didn' t believe him.
If he does contact you, I think it would be... in the best interest of your safety if you called us.
Now, here' s my card.
Toll- free number.
Interesting work.
Carter, you dick!
What are you doing?
Terry should be on this wall.
Shit.
Why' d you want us to meet you here?
They' re watching me to see if I go to Alex.
That' s why you' re taking me.
Why would I want to see him?
Because he knows which one of us is next.
Drive the speed limit, OK?
And don' t pass on the right.
Billy, wait a minute.
I' m getting a vision.
You' re the next one, man.
Man, why' d you say that?
Because if you say another word, I' il fucking kill you.
He could be anywhere from here to a mile down the road... so you guys start that way and meet back in the middle.
It' il take half the time.
Do you think they' re still up there?
Somehow, flight 180, are they still in flight?
Somewhere... are they safe?
I used to worry so much about my parents dying.
Lying awake at night, just worrying.
Most kids do, I guess.
Most kids never have it happen.
When I was ten... my dad went into a 7- Eleven for cigarettes.
He heard someone say, "Don' t turn around."
On reflex, or thinking it was a friend joking, he did.
A guy blew his head off.
Life became shit after that.
My mom couldn' t deal anymore.
She married this asshole who my mom with my real dad... would have crossed the street to avoid this guy.
He didn' t really want a kid... so my mom didn' t, either, anymore.
If that was the design for my father and family... then fuck death!
God, I have thought a lot about that somewhere.
Where me and my mom and my dad are still together... and have no idea about this life here.
Where our friends are still in the sky.
Where everyone gets a second chance.
Alex, we can' t give up.
I can' t go home, because after Mrs Lewton... they' re looking for me.
We' re taking you to my dad' s cabin.
It' s a couple of miles from my house.
Browning, you fucking warlock... did you hear about Ms Lewton or what?
Why do you think I was hiding?
Billy told the FBl he saw you running from her house.
I was running 'cause they blame me for everything.
They blame me for Tod, for her... for the fucking plane crash.
The fire caramelized her blood.
Your shoe prints were in it, your fingerprints on the knives.
I told you they were not...
Or even if you knew she was dead.
Did you know she was going to be next before she was?
Yeah, I did.
All right, out of us... who' s next to see it?
Please... tell me I' m going to see the Jets win a Super Bowl.
It' s me, right?
That' s why you' re not saying.
I should have felt up Tammy in the pool that time.
What are you whining about?
He didn' t say anything.
Just drive.
You have a responsibility to tell me.
It' s not.
It' s fucking harder.
You get off having control over me?
Let me decide how to deal with it.
'cause we' re all on the same list.
Fuck.
Really?
Then why bother?
What' s the fucking point?
Me and Terry' il be back together on the other side... so why wait any longer?
What are you doing?
Carter, slow down.
- Fuck you!
Knock it off!
May as well go out on my own free will!
Not with us in the fucking car!
Carter, stop the car!
What' s the fucking worry if it ain' t your time?
You all wouldn' t get shit.
It doesn' t work that way!
I fucking hated French class!
- Get control of yourself.
- That' s what I' m doing!
I know what you' re doing, and it' s all right to be scared.
I' m not afraid.
I decide when it' s time.
I control my life.
I control my death.
You don' t have to prove how big your balls are!
Stop driving like such an asshole.
Jesus Christ!
Put your hands back on the wheel!
- Back on the wheel!
Shit.
Carter, easy.
I am so close to puking right now.
We' re afraid, too, but we' re not quitting.
Stop it and stop this fucking car!
Damn it, I want you to stop this car right now!
- Move it.
- Open the door, Billy.
Move the fucking car!
- Open the fucking door.
- Move the car.
- Open the fucking door.
- Open it!
- Billy, open the door!
Don' t do this.
Get out of the fucking car!
Carter, listen to me!
This isn' t the way!
It' s not the way!
Get out of the car!
It' s coming!
It ain' t my time.
Listen to me!
This isn' t the way.
Get out of the car!
Come on!
Get out!
I can' t get out!
Man, he really is next.
Get out!
Fuck!
Oh, God!
I saw it!
I saw the belt!
You scared now?
It broke!
Bullshit!
He saved your life again.
That' s right!
You' re next, Carter!
I' m staying the fuck away from you!
- Shut up, Billy!
- We don' t need this shit now.
I don' t need it ever!
Get away from him!
He' s next!
Fuck you, Billy!
I' m not dead!
You will be.
You' re dead... and you ain' t taking me with you!
- God, no!
- Oh, shit!
You were after Lewton.
That' s the plan!
That' s the design!
You should be fucking dead!
You' re the devil!
I saw the seat belt.
I knew it would rip!
That' s how I saved him.
Just like the explosion.
I saw it!
- The police are coming.
- Fuck!
Because I saved him, it skipped Carter... and went to the next person in the path of the explosion!
I have to see it.
Then I intervene... and if I intervene, I cheat the design.
Intervene?
Are you God now?
God' s not afraid to die.
We do!
Baby, you are losing it.
The police will be here.
We have to get you back to my cabin.
You can hide out and get your head together.
After Billy, I' m next.
I' m next.
Then me.
Listen, I' m not going to let it happen.
Listen to me.
Why don' t you two get the fuck out of here?
Rusted.
Tetanus.
I overlooked it.
You tried to capitalize, but I caught you.
You fuck!
I can beat you.
Maybe not forever... but I got this cabin rigged to beat you now!
She was there a minute ago.
What are you talking about?
I' m not turning him in.
It' s too dangerous for him out there alone.
I go with you.
You can' t.
Just tell us where he is.
Wait at home.
I give you my word... we will bring him in safely in protective custody.
I never moved.
Christa asked me to change, but I never moved.
Fuck!
Why didn' t I remember that?
Clear' s seat was in front of mine.
She' s next.
We' re going around!
- There!
- Come on, let' s go!
Alex, we' re trying to help you.
Prince!
Get away from it!
Hold on!
Run!
From the direction, there' s only one place he' s heading.
No shit.
Oh, my God!
Stay there!
Don' t move!
Don' t touch anything.
You' re grounded by the tyres.
The car' s going to explode!
You know what to do.
Don' t!
When I do this, it' il skip you, and it' il all be over.
Don' t!
I am not going to let it beat us both.
You know what to do!
I' il always be with you.
Don' t!
Get away from there!
Damn it!
You can' t do this to me.
Come on.
Shit, he' s not breathing.
Stay with me.
Well, we made it.
Paris.
I can' t believe it.
I can' t believe we got on a plane again.
Know what I' m saying?
It' s weird being here, huh?
It' s just there' s something missing.
You know?
To Terry.
And to Tod.
To all of our friends that can' t be here.
Cheers.
What?
I don' t know.
Sometimes it feels like... you two are the only ones who understand.
You were right, Browning.
There was a design.
We won.
The only thing we won is a chance at a full life.
A chance that I won' t ever waste.
There' s just something I can' t figure out.
- About what?
- The design.
Just let it go, all right?
Hear me out, all right?
- Just listen.
The explosion path determined the order of our deaths.
Then it was Clear.
But I intervened and saved her, so it went to me.
But in my case, no one intervened, right?
I was thrown from that power line... by the explosion, so...
So why did it skip you?
How do we know this isn' t what was meant to happen?
That out of everyone on flight 180... you, me, and Carter were meant to live?
Maybe that was the design all along.
- Shut up, Carter.
I didn' t make up the rules.
Somebody' s got to intervene before death can skip them.
Alex proved that three times with the plane, me, and you.
For all I know, it could circle back... and get us all again.
But I am the safest fucker in the world... because you' re still next.
Let' s figure out...
I' il go with you.
No, just stay here, OK, Clear?
See?
It' s true.
I told you you were next, man.
Stop it, Carter.
Alex, wait.
Clear, stay there, OK?
Stay away.
- It skipped me.
Come on, honey.
If we don' t leave now, we don´t get into the club.
I' m just finishing up a few e- mails.
Oh, what?
My publisher wants to schedule a book tour and I' m just confirming dates.
Okay, that can wait, sweetie.
The students need help identifying the cause of a fracture on a lateral epicondyle.
TGlF.
You heard of that?
Yeah.
It' s some kind of acronym.
But my inbox is full.
We know that' s not true.
And there' s a TV show that needs research.
Not that they listen.
We' re going.
I really should catalogue that skull.
It' s in the museum' s exhibit on the French Revolution.
Yeah, Pepe LePew is more important than booze and boys.
I don' t think that' s his name.
DJ Rulz
Feels good, doesn' t it?
Being with people who are alive.
It' s very stimulating, I have to admit.
We' re so going to tear it up tonight.
- That' s slang, right?
- Right.
Is my costume all right?
Sweetie, it' s not a costume, it' s a cute outfit, and yes, it looks perfect.
I know, it' s very, very warm in here.
No, because it looks great.
We´re so get in check up!
- I love this music!
- DJ Rulz!
He is so hot!
It' s so tribal.
- You don´t say tribal, sweetie.
- Why?
Oh, because of all the black people?
Sweetie, just for tonight, have fun, stop dissecting and take part.
Well, African- Americans aren' t the only ones with a tribal heritage.
You saying we' re natives in some tribe?
Anthropologically speaking, we' re all members of tribes.
You' d better shut your mouth.
I just meant hip- hop mirrors the direct visceral connection you see in tribal communication.
What?
After the Cartesian split he 17th century, we separated our minds from our bodies, the numinous from the animalistic.
Are you calling me an animal, fool?
No fool, she´s using the Cart foilosophy to say she' s down with the music.
Now, who are you calling a fool, fool?
Get out of my way.
We' re going.
We' re going.
You shouldn' t have done that, bitch.
Are you sure she can handle this?
No one in our lab knows the first thing about dealing with a mummy.
I' d have to call her in anyway.
She assaulted two agents who were trying to tape off the body.
They were trying to compromise the remains.
A cloud of meth covered the dance floor.
I think they inhale quite a lot.
Are you two high?
Only by accident, so it doesn' t count.
Wait.
Why did you bring Tessa?
This doesn' t seem like such a great date.
We were out to dinner when he got your call.
Your pupils are the size of saucers.
Get away from the remains!
Bones, simmer down.
How long is this going to take?
Who the hell wants to know?
I' m sorry.
He works for me.
I' m Randall Hall.
I run this place.
You run this place, Mr. Hall.
Just so you know, 'cause we, uh, found some drugs on the dead...
We found them.
We found them.
We found some drugs on the dead guy.
We' re going to want to know where they came from, why he had them...
Why?
- Why he had them.
- Why he had them.
Any idea who he is?
Any idea?
The guy barely looks human.
What makes you think I' d regnize him?
Bones... how did something like this happen?
The Egyptians would give the body a cedar oil enema and then rinse it with wine and cover it with salt.
Bones, you are totally wasted.
Zack!
Zack!
Come here, come here. n' t thls a beautiful specimen of mummification?
What' s going on?
Let' s just say your boss inhaled.
See how perfectly drie and preserved the skin is.
You don' t find something like this every day.
Tessa, have you seen it
It' s so hard to believe that you two would be a couple.
You know, cop and lawyer.
It' s very touching.
I' m going to grab a cab.
Oh, no, oh, okay, hold on.
Well, uh... Sorry.
Here.
I' m going to make it up to you, I promise. okay?
Ice cream later.
- Take care.
- I' il talk to you later.
Talk to you later.
Can we just stick to the business here?
Thank you.
I´m gonna need a list of your employees, all right?
We' il find out -- run them through the system, see if any one of them have a drug conviction.
How long before you can ID him?
Well I´m not all tired, so I' m sure I can stay up all night and work.
We have to be careful removing him.
He' s very dry and brittle.
My first modern mummy.
Bones 1x06
Narkond
Crystal meth is made from cold medicine, lye, and the strike pads from matchbooks.
The body was not designed to deal with that kind of assault.
So I' m finding out.
Chamomile tea?
It' s very soothing.
JI just need your results.
How about a stick to pry the monkey off your back?
Are you sure you need me here?
Payback for showing me the good life.
Ok, so how is my man, the Tut?
In better shape than I am
The meth found in his lungs and nasal passages matches the meth that juiced Angela and the good doctor here.
Can you please keep it clinical?
So, uh, he died of, uh, an overdose.
Asphyxiation.
The meth coated the alveoli in his lungs, making breathing impossible.
So, uh, he, uh, overdosed with his meth behind the wall?
The little space was too narrow for him to squeeze through.
He got stuck, the bag broke, and when he gasped for air, he inhaled and died instantaneously.
The dry air convection behind the wall removed most of the moisture from his body
How long he was, uh, in there?
Judging from the acarid mites in his ears, I' d say six weeks.
Hey, didn' t he have hands?
They' re easier to work with dismembered.
I' ve rehydrated them so we can get some fingerprints.
- Off that?
- Sure.
You ever been to Costa Rica?
I was flown down once.
They found a human skull... 12, 000 years old
Why?
I' m finally getting some vacation time.
I was gonna head off on Thursday.
Heard Costa Rica was beautiful.
Yes.
Fascinating wildlife, lots of parrots.
Oh, I don' t like parrots.
No.
People should really, really do all the talking, you know.
Maybe I should...
Oh God!
What are you doing?
The Aztecs would flay people and then wear their skin as a bodysuit.
I guess you won' t be needing mittens for Christmas.
Did the FBI find a match?
Yup.
His name is Roy Taylor.
Roy Taylor?
You' re kidding.
It' s DJ Mount!
I don' t know who that is.
Mount is one of the best DJs in DC.
He used to play at the club.
Everyone was wondering what happened to him.
His album is really going to take off after this.
Never knew this side of you, Bones.
It' s DJ Mount.
You' re hung over.
Does this make your head explode?
I grabbed a couple hours sleep on my couch and showered in the lab' s decontamination room.
You really know how to live.
JmsJay, Tupac, Biggie...
Do you even know who you' re talking about?
Yeah, I' ve done my Googling.
eah, fill your ass up... with lead?!
Always a nice lyric.
I' m heading back to the club to meet the FBI forensics team.
I' m getting facts.
DJ Mount was starting to break, finally making some money.
Someone who' s never had anything, that can go to your head.
So, he gets involved with drugs.
You didn' t know who he was hanging with or who might have been chasing him?
Everyone wants to be number one.
I mean, you have to know who the rivals are, Mr. Hall. q
It affects your bottom line.
Wait for me by the elevator.
Rulz.
What rules?
That' s his name.
He performs at the club.
I' m trying to keep my crew together, Agent Booth, but I always had to run interference between those two
Why?
Ask Rulz.
Was it fun coming to the club?
Yeah, before the drugs and the dead body.
Tilt... tilt down.
It seems so primitive, being in a crowd of strangers, gyrating to music.
You never dance.
I' ve been told I look like a marionette in a wind storm.
You would' ve fit right in last night.
Really?
Footprints.
In the dirt and the termite shavings.
Someone was on the other side of him.
Light.
This leads to the outside.
- We need to get inside that wall.
- Or take it down.
One last look?
Take them in, show them around.
- Agent Booth?
- Yeah.
Roy Taylor´s father.
Maybe you know him as DJ Mount.
- Mr. Taylor, please come in.
- Thank you for seeing me.
Please sit.
You' re the one looking into my son' s murder?
Investigating his death, yes, sir.
I' m sorry for your loss.
I have some information you need.
- About your son' s death?
- No, sir.
About his life.
I' ve been readingin the newspaper. how my son was a part of the meth scene.
Now he was killed by drugs, behind the wall right there.
What my son did... was graduate third in his class from high school.
He would have graduated first... except he... he worked a full- time job.
Track- and- eld medals.
Baseball.
Roy never drank, and he never did drugs.
Do you understand me, sir?
Mr. Taylor...
How they are portraying my boy in the newspapers is wrong.
If his mother was alive it would kill her.
I taught him a relationship with Jesus.
Do you understand, sir?
A personal relationship with Jesus.
With all due respect, sir, sometimes when kids grow up they change.
They move away from what they were taught.
Five years old, he made this.
And a lady who... who reads palms she looked at it and she said... she said my boy was going to be a great man.
A good man.
He read no evil inhat boy' hand.
I can see that now, sir.
Some iniquity killed my boy.
You know that word, Agent Booth?
It' s from the Bible.
"Deliver me... from the workers of iniquity... and save me from bloody men."
You know your salms.
I can trust that you will find out what happened to my boy?
Yes, sir.
Good.
Then I' m glad I came by.
Can we conform to as much forensic protocol as possible?
We' re better at this than you think.
You know what those are?
Rats. intensive scare of rats eat the laces right out of our boots.
Take it easy there, Willard.
Here are the footprints.
There are marks on the wall.
It' s scraped.
Bloosmear... dried.
I see something.
Can I retrieve?
Yes.
Apparently, there' s a rivalry between Mount and this guy Rulz.
We saw him perform at the club last night.
Did you talk to him?
I don' t have enough yet.
I go in too soon, he could run.
Wow, that' s a beautiful piece.
Zirconium or diamond?
I' m more focused on the dried blood and flesh at the moment.
You buy Tessa jewelry?
I really don' t want to talk about that right now.
Too much of a commitment?
I just thought because, you two were going away.
Do you have anything yet?
Given the rate of air convection, and the degree of dehydration of the flesh,
I' d say they were there at the same time.
Must hurt like hell to get that thing ripped out of your belly button.
- I thought it was an earring.
- Look at the size of the stud.
I had one of these.
Before they became totally Miami- divorcee.
Good news.
I was able to pull some particulates.
Are those, uh...?
Yeah.
Two types of foreign material in the eyes --
low- density polyethylene residue and methamphetamine crystals.
Polyethylene?
Came from the plastic bag holding the meth.
This can be cleaned now.
Yeah!
That' s a real diamond.
Why don' t you get her a belly button ring?
That' s not too much of a commitment.
Yeah, that' s great.
The inside of the lips was damaged by the teeth.
This was not an accidental inhalation.
Someone was to smother him.
Which would explain how the particulates got into the eye.
So he didn' t OD.
He was murdered.
So we just have to find out who owns this belly button ring.
Look at this.
"Luv Rulz."
At least we know who to ask.
Hello.
Yeah, it' s open.
Yeah, it' s open.
Special Agent Booth
Is the FBI recruiting from America' s Top Model now?
I' m a forensic anthropologist at the Jeffersonian.
She works for the FBl.
Yeah, I can live with that.
Dr. Brennan also discovered that Roy Taylor was murdered.
So?
So, murder is wacked.
See, 'cause those are the rules...
Rulz.
Maybe he had it come to me.
Oh, so you and Roy Taylor don' t get along.
That sucker ran me down, man.
Tried to slam me on one of his tracks, and ain' t nobody do that.
And, uh... what happens when they do?
I take a piece of them.
I got in his face one night at the Bassment. told to disappear, and I ain' t seen him since.
'Cause he knew to follow the Rulz.
And, uh, maybe your girlfriend made sure that your... your problem just went away.
That ain' t my woman no more.
I kicked her sorry ass a months ago.
What is her sorry ass name?
Eve Warren.
What was she doing with Mount?
Take a guess.
I guess it was just his turn.
She kept your ring?
It' s a diamond, man.
Why she gonna get rid of that?
Any idea where she is now?
Probably ripping somebody else off.
That girl don' t care about nobody but herself.
Even though she got a kid, don' t care about her neither.
Let her brother shoulder that.
Bitch.
What happened to your hand?
I got shot through the wrist a few years ago.
Shattered the lower radius and the pisiform.
Yeah.
I got some nerve damage, too.
That' s impressive
Yeah!
I got shot in the back and through the leg, too.
You want to see the scars?
Thanks anyway.
Let us know if you hear from Eve Warren.
That' s all I got for y' all.
I' m gonna get back to work.
Let us know if you hear from her.
Bones?
I like this music.
Okay, how about this:
DJ Mount trusted Eve because they were sleeping together.
So she meets him in the wall, takes the drugs, kill him for Rulz then he takes off.
You should write fiction.
What?
It' s reasonable.
It´s not based on evidences It' s conjecture.
Look, I' m positing a scenario.
We' ve been through this before.
Yeah, and it always seems to be a waste of time.
You know, I think I need a vacation.
I think you do, too.
I' m not the one who' s snippy.
Snippy?
What are you, 70?
See what I mean?
I think you should find a nice, relaxing place to go on that vacation.
Somewhere where you can get a massage, maybe do some yoga.
Okay, push- ups, sit- ups, pull- ups, that' s what I do.
That' s more cardiovascular.
Yoga deals more with...
Why exactly are we talking aut this?
Because you' re tense.
Because we' re talking.
You switched my music.
- Roy Taylor?
- Yes.
Anything pop out at you now that the bones are clean?
There' s some damage to the facet joint and foramen on C- 4 on the right side of the neck.
That suggests his head was forced that way.
One other thing.
I was looking the skull through the microscope came across a slight depression.
Barely discernible.
Slight indentation?
Could be congenital or a bone anomaly.
Probably.
Do you ever go on vacation?
I take my vacation when you take your vacation.
What do you do?
Go back home to Michigan.
See the family.
I have three brothers and four sisters.
Do you enjoy that?
God, no.
I work with corpses and skeletons.
They think I' m a freak.
Then why do you go?
It' s my family.
They love me.
Take a closer look he anomaly under the scanning microscope.
See what made that mark.
What do you want?
Special Agent Booth, FBl.
This is my associate Dr. Brennan.
- What you call this?
- The Krump.
The kids -- they come her they dance.
They don' t gangbang.
So what do you want?
You didn' t come here for a dance lesson.
Hi, Maya.
How you doing, baby?
We' re going to go outside and gonna play with the rest of the kids, okay?
There you go.
We' d like to ask you a few questions about your sister Eve.
What' s she done now?
When was the last time you saw her?
About six weeks ago when she dropped off Maya.
Just dropped her off and left?
Told me she needed me to watch her for a couple days.
Left me some money.
Did you, um, happen to have a, I don' t know, recent photo that we could take?
Evie said she had cleaned herself out
She was turning her life around, and I believed her.
And she never came back.
So that little girl out there, that' s her daughter.
She' s like a daughter to me, too.
Didn´t it bother you that Eve never came back?
I mean, didn' t you go look for her?
I learned to let her go.
And Eve, she' s had a lot of problems.
Drugs, hanging out with the wrong people.
I mean, if I track her down and she takes Maya before she' s ready...
I' m not letting nothin 'happen to that little girl.
Do you know Roy Taylor?
Met him.
DJ Mount. I like his stuff.
He' s pure.
Play it for the kids.
We have reason to believe that she was with him the night was murdered.
Murdered?
You can' t find Evie?
No.
She told me she loved him.
And... she and Mount were gonna take Maya away out of DC... give her a better life, one we never had.
She said she left you some cash.
Yeah.
For Maya.
I' il buy what you have, two dollars to one.
Sure, man...
You may want the stooges the FBl... who are experts, due to your so- called "drug war" -- to run a comparison, but I' d say the methamphetamine on these bills matches the meth found with DJ Mount behind the wall.
And my guess is that Eve was with Mount at the time that he was murdered.
How about this, huh?
DJ Mount rejects Eve because of her questionable past.
So, uh, hey, she gets mad, she wants to leave with some money, so, uh...
What?
Yeah, I don' t really think much about that kind of stuff.
I' m more about bugs and minerals.
Sorry.
Oh, come on, Hodgins, hey, you' re a smart guy, you' re a smart guy.
Look up from your microscope, huh?
These are real people we' re trying to figure out here.
Maybe she was just using Mount, setting him up to get his drugs and money.
Very nice, Hodgins.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Real question is, where does she go next?
You' re on fire, man.
After she left her brother' s place, because that is where she met her untimely end.
You know what?
I' m gonna turn you into an investigator yet.
No, no, no, no.
Bugs and slimede, that is where I' m happy.
The damage to his C- 4 vertebra was the result of his head being twisted so far to the right.
He was moving this way, toward Eve.
My bet is he was chasing her.
And that' s based on...?
Money and meth.
She left that corridor carrying money saturated in the same meth that killed Mount.
She was moving fast.
She didn' t even stop when her belly ring got ripped out.
Hey, money' s a pretty good reason to get chased, hm?
Only question is, why wasn' t he facing her?
It got thigh back there.
15 centimeters.
Eve ripped out her belly button ring here, and then left a smear of blood until the corridor widened.
Here.
What?
That just... makes me a little sick.
You pick dead bodies out of mass graves, and yanking out a belly button ring makes you sick?
Okay, okay, moving on.
All right, I' ve shot a lot of people on my time and I got to admit, that whole belly button thing makes me nauseous, too.
Thank you
At this point, Mount must have looked behind him but kept going.
Then the passageway narrowed, so he couldn' t turn his head back toward Eve.
Then there' s no way she could' ve shove the meth into his face...
Eve didn' t kill him.
A third person surprised them -- that' s why he turned his head to look.
Mount' s body prevented this third person from getting to Eve, so she escaped.
Ah.
But the real question is, who the hell is this third person?
Why the hell you pick me up, man?
I think you know why I brought you in.
Yeah, right.
I waited for you to contact me, explain your situation, but you didn' t do that.
That' s not polite.
What are you, DEA?
Metro cop?
I' m Special Agent Ronald Oakes.
One of us?
My orders were not to break deep cover for anybody.
Out of deep regard for my FBI brother...
I gave you the nod.
That' s bull.
I made you.
Now you' re making excuses.
Got any keys for these cuffs?
Fine.
Have it your way.
You know I need more than aod, man.
I' m conducting a murder investigation.
Now, I need to know what you know.
Been 15 months on the task force investigating the links between the urban music business and gang activity.
So that' s why you got next to Randall Hall.
"Randall Hall" is a clean alias.
You ran him, right?
Yeah.
Came back clean?
Exactly.
His real name is Terence Baskin.
Now, we know... that he' s pushing meth through the club.
But we can' t get enough to touch him.
Our informants disappeared.
They either get bought off or they get killed.
What about this murder?
The night that DJ Mount disappeared, Hall got ripped of for a mountain of meth and a ton of cash.
DJ Mount ripped of all?
Nah, doesn' t scan.
Mount was into Jesus, not chalk.
Hall killed DJ Mount.
Hall has people do that type of stuff for him.
So listen, anybody asks... why' d you have me arrested?
Weapons beef.
- So I don' t get my gun back.
- No.
No.
We meet up again... if you get an excuse, hit me.
Oh... count on it.
I' ve been investigated for years.
Why do you think they never got me on anything?
'Cause you' re so smart?
Because Terence Baskin is my past.
I am 100% clean now.
This is my life now.
This and my recorrd label.
Not crystal meth, not gang- banging.
Yet much of the iconic quality of urban music lies in the perceived or actual rivalry between the principal artists.
Where did you find her?
Museum.
lead to murder?
Sure, they were both capable.
Add in the fact that Mount was sleeping with Rulz 'girlfriend Eve.
Yeah, in fact...
Yeah?
Rulz built himself a studio around that time.
Poured cement for the pad a day after they disappeared
So...?
I' m saying, Mount' s dead,
Eve' s gone missing.
You might want to consider that.
Let' s go.
What do you think?
Oh, I think, uh, I think we need to find a way to find a body buried under a slab of cement.
Well, can' t you get a warrant?
To look around the premises, maybe, but no way to tear it up.
Well, let me make a phone call.
Tutti' s traveled the world finding dead bodies.
Does Tutti always drool like that?
What, I' m gonna hurt her... his feelings?
Tutti is the best cadaver dog in the world, Agent Booth.
It' s true.
If you were a dead body, you' d want Tutti looking for you.
How can it smell anything buried under a building? he can
Once, I saw Tutti find a dead body wraped in plastic, under concrete, after four years.
Tutti can smell decaying blood on a tooth six feet underground.
I mean, so what?
He drools a little.
What' s up with that?
You know, your eyes are kind of close together, but I don' t comment.
I apologize.
Is he sincere?
Yeah.
All right, then, we accept.
Good boy, Tutti.
Tutti found something.
Oh, maybe he' s just lazy.
Lying down is his indicator.
Tutti found it.
There' s a body under here.
You should get a warrant to bring a jackhammer for this floor.
I' d start digging here.
Dental records confirm that this is Eve Warren.
Insect activity confirms she died around the same time DJ Mount did.
Where did Booth go?
I got to give him the news.
- They' re up in the lounge.
Zack, clean the bones.
We' ve already got cause of death and identity -- what am I looking for?
It might be grasping but that odd mark we found on Mount' s skull, see if you can find anything like it on Eve' s remains.
Jamaica?
God, that' s incredible.
Mm, it' s a bed- and- breakfast.
Snorkeling, kayaking... you two are so ready for the pre- shacking- up test vacation.
What do you mean?
You have keys to each other' s places.
You' ve done the weekend away a couple times.
Yeah, it' s time for the ten- day vacation.
You know, Jamaica' s like a dry run for living together, only with rum punch and steel drums.
Yeah, see you later.
Living together?
Silly.
Thanks, you know, for bringing me a shirt.
Yeah, okay.
I' il talk to you later.
Yeah.
- Hi, Tessa.
- Yeah, okay, bye.
- It' s Eve Warren.
- Eve Warren.
- Uh, cause of death?
- Same as Mount.
- Meth overdose.
- Pushed in the face, but there' s more.
I don' t think that Rulz killed her.
- She was buried under his studio.
- But her wrist was broken.
Bone damage indicates that was taken from behind and smash into wall
Her skull shows damage to both the infraorbital and supraorbital margins and the zygomatic process.
Zygo- zu...?
You said she was killed by crystal meth.
She was.
She would' ve been hurt and stunned by the blow but not killed, certainly not immediately.
A bag of crystal meth was placed over her face actually ground into wounds, into the airway.
Rulz couldn' t have smashed her into a wall?
Her radius was separated from the scaphoid and trapezium.
Her right wrist was twisted hard behind her back.
There' s damage to both the elbow and the shoulder, as well.
For that to happen, Eve' s attacker would' ve had to twist her arm up with his right hand while jamming the crystal meth into her face with the other.
Both with a great deal of force.
Rulz had been shot twice in the right hand.
I got it.
He had nerve damage.
There´s no way he had the strength to kill Eve Warren
You did not murder Eve Warren.
This is a weird kind of interrogation, huh?
Cops telling me what I didn' t do.
Well, then, do me a favor: tell me Bones is wrong and confess to a murder.
Hell, no, man.
What you think, I' m some type of idiot?
Well, do me a favor, deny it.
See, you got tricks.
You gonna twist all my words around.
Better not say anything at all.
You didn' t kill Eve Warren.
So you say.
The Rulz says say nothing.
- He wants us hold him.
- Why?
Because every time some raper gets murdered, his business goes straight through the roof.
Why should DJ Mount get the bump, huh?
Maybe it' s my turn.
I' il tell you what.
I' il make you a better deal.
You tell us what we need to know, and I' il have those charges laid against you, put you in the Remand Center.
For how long?
Oh, that depends on what you tell us.
Wait!
Wait!
You' re negotiating to put this guy in jail?
Sweeten the pot, I' il charge you with Mount' s death, too.
You hire one of those moron lawyers, and you' il be thrown in lock- up for what, maybe a month.
Sweet.
Where am I... in Backwards World?
What have you got?
Look, I can tell y' all.
But y' all have to figure out the rest on your own.
We have to figure it out just from motive?
Okay, look, Bones, this is, you know, sort of my thing.
Man, Mount was going to jump.
You mean commit suicide?
Where did you find her?
The museum.
Jump labels.
You' re saying that DJ Mount was going to leave Bassment Records?
All he needed was the money to buy himself back.
That' s why he got himself killed.
Now if Hall even finds out that I told you all that much,
I' m going to end up some dried- out mummy in a wall.
But what about Eve?
Eve couldn' t kill nobody.
Sex 'em to death maybe, but that' s about it.
Oh, there' s one more thing... the next day, Hall built me a new studio.
Took it out of my money, too.
So, you gonna put me in jail?
EWell, you know, hey, it' s the least we can do, hmm?
Hey, how about this?
Hall' s got motive to kill Mount.
Because he' s jumping labels and he' s running away with some girl who' s stealing Mount' s meth and money.
I' m starting to see how this whole motive thing works.
Thank you.
It' s still murky psychological guesswork, though.
Dr. Brennan, I found a mark on Eve Warren here on the manubrium.
Compare it to the mark on Mount.
Okay, Eve tells Mount that he wants to start a new life.
So she rips off the dope and the cash thinking she can build a new future with it.
It' s a story, Booth. You need to find something real.
For what?
I mean, it feels real to me... I mean, Eve is a woman in love, whs trying to escape a world that' s just crushing her.
Mount finds out how much trouble the woman he' s in love with is in, so he gives up his own life to protect her It' s not enough.
They were hoping for a better life and they both wind up dead.
Looks like a match.
Thanks.
Good job.
- What the hell is that?
- Not sure.
It' s a bone dimple.
But they both have it, so it can' t be genetic.
Something external caused it, but I' m not sure what.
Randall Hall.
He' s behind this.
Randall Hall... okay, he killed these two people.
We know it; he did it.
We just can' t touch him.
And there' s no evidence linking him to the drugs, the cash or either body.
Except f a couple of damn bone dimples.
I' il keep looking at the remains... maybe find the evidence we need.
I can' t let it stand.
What?
You know what?
I' m going to spread the pain.
Okay?
That' s my new motto.
Wait!
I can help spread pain.
Wait!
We know you did it.
What?
Killed Mount in that wall so that he wouldn' t leave your label.
You killed Eve Warren.
Killed her and buried her under Rulz' s studio.
In the meantime, this i going to have to remain an active crime scene.
That' s harassment.
I' il sue.
Well, I' m going to harass you every chance I get.
I' m not somebody you want to mess with.
Did you just poke me?
Did he just poke me with his little stick?
This is my place.
I want to poke someone, I do it.
All right, how easily do you think I scare?
Hey, Booth?
Don' t break the cane.
Arrest him and confiscate the cane as evidence.
I need the cane.
Arrest him for what?
He' s the guy who pointed a gun at a federal agent.
Uttering threats or smelling bad or anything.
It' s the cane we want.
Fine, here.
Randal Hall
I am placing you under arrest... for assault of a federal agent.
This will never go to court.
Oh, let' s go find out.
Oh, next time I take your gun away from you, I' il shoot you.
Well then, I bette not let you get my gun again.
Come on Let´s go!
I called Tessa, to tell her a cole of places she should check out in Jamaica...
- she' s not going.
- What happened?
Well, she said something came up at work, but I know the truth.
How many times do you want me to poke Zack?
Just once, but as hard as you can.
As hard as he can?
Why don' t I hit him as haras I can?
Because you have arms like noodles, while I am vigorous and burly.
What truth?
That all you got, burly boy?
They got freaked out by Stage Six.
What... what is Stage Six?
One:
Spend the Night;
Two:
Spend the Weekend;
Three:
Exchange Keys;
Four:
Sexy Weekend Getaway;
Five:
Extended Vacation; inevitably folloby Six:
Move in Together.
I' m an anthropologist.
I know the stages of everything.
You made those up.
I did not.
Yes, you did.
They got to Stage Five and they balked.
Not Booth.
Booth did not balk.
Sweetie, it' s always the guy.
No, Booth is not a balker.
Hey!
The mark on Mount, the mark on Eve.
They' re the same.
He can' t resist hitting them with that stupid cane.
The end of the cane, it' s a fit for both marks.
Hall' s the killer.
Send the cane, the photos, and the medium to the FBl.
Let them confirm the match.
What, and let them have all the glory?
My chest hurts.
Yeah.. all the glory.
led the charges being file today by the Dtrict Attorney.
Getting yourself in the mood?
Trying.
You know, this... really isn' t going to be the type of vacation I hoping for.
Tessa' s not going.
Something came up at work.
Too bad.
I' m sorry.
Hey, I like going on vacations by myself.
Really?
Sure, nothing wrong with being alone.
No, I mean, you like to go on vacation?
Yeah, I go places all the time.
You ever just, you know, sit on the beach?
Pretend there' s no such thing as skeletons?
Is that in any way fun?
When was the last time you got away?
Got away from what?
Ah, Bones, you know, 'cause what usually happens to me...
I think about not coming back.
Seriously?
the two of you laugh.
But when you' re alone... the world is full of possibilities.
See you next week.

It was in our blood.
- Me too.
Ginger, I think we' ve lost our way.
We haven' t lost anything, Brigitte.
It' s lost us.
Shh.
Come on.
Come on!
Fine then.
We' il all walk.
Come on.
Let' s go.
Hello?
Ginger.
Are you all right?
What happened here?
My sister... gone.
Many summers... in the wind, in the trees and in the blood.
Sisters.
They were hers and her sister' s.
Thank you.
- Say "thank you," Ginger.
- Thank you.
Kill the boy...... or one sister kills the other.
Easy, easy, easy!
- It' s all right.
Ginger!
No, come back!
Come back!
- I can' t!
I' m gonna go back to the camp and try and find the old woman.
Don' t leave me!
Look at me.
One, two...
- three...
Five... six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11...
50.
Ginger!
55, 56...
Help!
Brigitte!
Ginger.
I' m counting!
100.
You stay away from her, you son of a bitch!
Did he just whistle at us?
I' m sure he meant the dog.
Welcome to civilization.
Cormac!
Do these two look like anyone you' ve ever laid eyes on, other than while you were off pulling in some shithouse somewhere?
Answer me!
We don' t ever open the gate for anyone we don' t know.
You bloody idiot.
It' s nearly nightfall... we were looking for shelter.
Here we never talk out of turn, and while I' m spitting, it is always my turn.
But I see it is not the first time your mouth has made you trouble, is it?
Sergeant Major, stand down.
Mr. Rowlands.
She' s been bit.
How' d you come by that wound?
I stepped in a trap, and the Indian helped us.
We washed up on shore, but our... our parents were drowned.
Cast them out, Wallace.
Cast them out.
You put us all in grave peril if you give them refuge.
- You' ve been marked.
Let' s let Doc Murphy see to it.
- Our parents drowned?
- Yes, but they didn' t suffer.
It was really quite peaceful.
You' il have an ugly scar, but you' il keep the foot... if we make sure it doesn' t turn septic.
These... ugly black bastards, they like the blood.
- Oh God, no!
- But they' il settle for the sickness.
- She doesn' t want them on her.
- It' s a necessary evil.
My name is Wallace Rowlands.
I am Chief Factor at Fort Bailey.
And tonight, since you are our guests, dinner will be in the company hall.
Ladies, Mr. Murphy.
Do you feel that?
Good.
Be thankful.
It means you' re alive.
I' il get you something for the pain.
I really don' t have much to spare but...
Is it medicinal?
- Not in the least.
- Ginger?
Ah, enjoy it while it lasts, girl.
Mr. Murphy, those graves out there... is it the pox?
No, it' s not.
Your fort' s nearly abandoned.
Most of the people have gone home.
The rest aren' t sleeping too good.
What is everyone so afraid of?
Didn' t you see them... out there in the woods?
We saw nothing.
Not to worry, girl... because they saw you.
It' s good to have guests in the main house again.
You will find it more comfortable than your travels in the woods.
We passed an Indian camp on the way.
It looked like it had been attacked.
Oh?
Hmm.
Is that what' s happened here?
The damp in this place, it gets evil cold in the bones.
The Indians told the company this was a bad place to build a fort, but they didn' t listen.
So where is everyone?
The trade party was supposed to return with supplies two months ago.
It' s two months... and still no sign of them.
So there' s no passage east then?
For a few thousand miles.
This was Geoffrey' s room.
Wallace' s son.
- Where is he?
- He died... a few weeks ago.
These are for you.
I hope they fit all right.
They were Wallace' s wife' s.
She was a beautiful Indian girl.
She died too.
It was quite tragic.
Here' s the key.
I' il see you at dinner then.
Hmm.
What a lovely shade of dead.
Is a dead boy' s room the only one they' ve got?
It' s better than sleeping in the woods with a tree root for a pillow.
We' ve slept there before.
Together forever?
Together forever.
We should eat here more often.
There' s two chairs for you here.
Chief Factor, the blessing.
Yes, of course.
It wouldn' t be dinner if the Almighty didn' t join us.
Bless us, Father, for these Thy gifts of plenty which we are about to receive.
And verily... verily I say unto Thee,
let us not succumb to the temptations of the flesh, but rather remain chaste.
The faithful shall kneel on bleeding shins...
Amen.
Amen.
Scripture has twisted that man deadly.
And you... you watch it.
Enjoy it while it lasts.
There won' t be much more for any of us soon.
Supplies will get through.
We had scouts like you in my regiment out east... yes, which was a good thing.
like a sandbag.
On him...
Wallace does good to keep him here.
Hunter like him could kill anywhere.
What keeps him here?
Something he' s not telling.
No, you' re waiting for something.
What is it?
Got some kind of blood brothers out there?
They work us from the outside and you, redskin, work us from the inside?
Easy, easy!
Easy.
I am my own.
I stay because it is my will to stay.
And until they get you... remember that it was a redskin' s will that you even breathed your stink that long.
Gentlemen.
We stand on the brink of darkness... and the color of our gods has nothing whatsoever to do with it.
We have to abandon this place.
They' re just wooden walls.
Wooden walls?
Every man that has ever walked on this mortal earth... has walked here with us.
And we stand as far as they' ve ever come.
It' s these wooden walls that shelter every Rome ever built.
This battle' s every war ever won.
And that fire out there... every light that' s held back the dark.
Good Christian women need fear nothing.
- We' re not afraid.
- Oh yes, you are.
Two months this fort has been in the devil' s grip, and you two little girls walk right through our door.
- What is that?
The devil' s wickedness.
This place is to be drowned like a newborn deformity, to be cut out like a bleeding cancer, to be cast into hell like a stinking whore!
Don' t forget to say your prayers, ladies.
These people are fucked.
Ginger, come look at this.
These toys must be Geoffrey' s.
Hello?
Come over here.
I' m not going to hurt you.
Brigitte, wake up.
Get dressed.
I was dreaming...
Mother and Father were there.
- Mother and Father are dead.
- You' re bleeding.
- What have you done?
- What have I done?
Something bit me!
Something bit you?
I thought it was a boy.
It was some kind of animal... it was deformed.
It' s loose in the house.
Brigitte, please get up.
- Where are we going to go?
- Same place we always go... away.
Stop.
Did you hear that?
Ah, come here.
Get up... so I can rattle your pretty mouth again.
Come on.
Come on.
Don' t move.
Step back.
Do it.
She won' t.
No, you won' t.
Owen, Finn!
Get down here!
They' re on top of us!
- We' re coming!
- Help me!
Owen!
Tabarnac!
Oliver!
Don' t let me go, Finn!
Don' t let me go!
No!
- Don' t let them get me!
- Let him go!
Get the beam, Finn!
This way!
- Seamus!
Come on!
Fuck.
Shh!
There' s one inside.
This way.
Quickly!
En nomini patri, et fili, et spiritus sancti...
Burn in hell.
It' s in here with us.
Be quiet.
Run.
Run!
Close the door!
Break the window, Brigitte!
Help up here!
Somebody help us!
You bastard.
No.
That was no animal.
It looks septic.
They' ve got the place surrounded.
God help us!
Brigitte?
Hmm.
What have you done to my sister?
What will you do to your sister?
Thank you.
One sister kills the other...
Brigitte!
Oh God.
We need to see Dr. Murphy.
The air is bloody.
Kill the boy.
Mr. Murphy?
We need you to...
- What' s the matter, Finn?
- Uh, nothing.
I' m fine.
It' s just these leeches.
They can' t be trusted.
Go on.
Answer the girl, Finn.
Tell her what you' re doing.
I' m... just killing these leeches here.
You got bit last night, didn' t you, Finn?
No, I didn' t.
I did real good last night.
I' m sure I... shot the one that took Owen, and I' m real sure... not one of them even... so much as touched me.
I' m fit as a fiddle most of the time.
You' re a real good boy.
But you gotta listen to me now.
Put the knife down.
Now, get yourself a leech.
Do it, boy.
Now put it on you.
Do it, Finn.
No, not on your arm.
On your chest.
Please, Murphy.
I just wanna go home.
Yeah, me too, son.
We' re almost there.
Now, what can I do for you two ladies?
What the hell' s going on, Murph?
Finn got bit.
I put him down.
We can' t keep doing this!
He was no damn sick dog.
And when they' re bit, they turn.
Just like this one here did.
Wait a minute.
That' s Jean- Pierre' s mark, isn' t it, Claude?
No, you' re wrong.
- It' s not my brother' s.
- It' s the same mark.
It' s what happened to the boat crew.
It' s them turned.
No, Tab!
It' s him.
Who is Jean- Pierre?
Jean- Pierre is Claude' s brother, head of the boat crew.
They were supposed to return with provisions two months ago.
They left in the spring, and they haven' t come back.
There' s been no sign of them.
We need to know.
You need to know.
Check the eye.
Glass.
It' s him.
They' re all dead.
Or turned into these sieging monsters.
What' s more...
Jean- Pierre used to bunk up there where the hunter killed him.
It' s the last thing they remember... trying to come home.
It is time for us to confess our sins... beg for His mercy.
Can you not see we' re reaping what we' ve sown?
We' ve brought this upon ourselves.
I' m sure I' m going to hell for this, but shut your holy fucking mouth.
That' s it.
We pack up, we get the hell out of here.
We rest during the day.
- If the hunter leads us...
- No savage is leading me anywhere.
You don' t have to come.
I' m sick of your bile!
You' re the one fathering their whelps.
I' m going to rip your filthy tongue out of your skull!
None of it makes any difference.
The hunter to guide us, we' il be taking down him with us.
We' ve no choice, do you understand?
- Come on, Ginger.
- This is the fight!
And if it' s to be fought here, then so be it.
I' ve lost my wife to it.
I' ve lost my son to it.
Let them come.
He' s lying to them.
His son' s not dead.
That was him that bit me.
He' s still lives in the house.
He' s turning into one of those creatures.
- So am I.
- No...
I can smell their blood.
Yours too.
Be quiet.
Stop, just stop.
- Shh.
- Oh God.
When we were boys in France, my grandfather told my brother and I of le loup- garou... man transformed into wolf.
On the full moon, it preyed on the shepherds... and travelers near his village.
The old men warned us... beware its bite, or we might become a slave to the full moon too.
It gave me bad dreams...
But my brother said,
"Don' t worry, Claude, if it bites you, you won' t become one.
Because I will help you catch it, so you can kill it before you turn... and the spell will be broken. "
It was a long time ago... and we were just little boys.
God' s forgiveness and mercy for his children is boundless.
Those lost in battle with evil shall find glory in the fields of Heaven.
He has brought peace and eternal rest upon the souls of Finn Maclntyre and Owen Crisp.
But verily I say unto thee, those that court sin shall be lost to the fire.
They shall become the very armies of the beast.
No longer can we flout God.
No longer can we give refuge to the evil amongst us.
No longer can we cast our seed into the dusky heathen bitch.
For he who was cast down into the fire is upon us, and his name is Legion for he is many!
Come on, boy.
I can' t find my mother.
I' ve looked and looked.
I miss mine too.
Geoffrey, wait.
Lift.
Let me look at it.
How is it?
It' s fine.
It' s getting better.
I' m going to get something for the pain.
There' s nothing you can do.
Brigitte, where' s your sister?
Resting.
The excitement... she can sometimes be a little... frail.
She' s all right?
She let Geoffrey out.
The others don' t know he' s alive.
You saw them out there.
They' d kill him.
What happened to him?
My wife and he were attacked.
She was killed.
He had been bitten.
For a while it seemed he might recover.
But then he began to change into one of them.
Every day I look into his eyes and I see less and less my little boy.
Can you imagine what that' s like?
You look after your sister.
Kill the boy.
I have to kill him...
If I... if I kill him... just like she said,
I kill the boy and the curse' il be lifted.
Milo?
Seamus?
It was just here.
Jesus Christ.
I' ve got something for you.
You can wear it in a locket.
Hmm...
Okay, get her out!
Get her out of here!
Quiet!
It isn' t a wolf bite, is it?
No...
Get a good bite, little bitch.
Good and deep.
Ahh...
Oh God!
Oh God!
Stand away from the girl.
Now get out.
Mr. Rowlands.
I' il get you, boy.
They' re going to kill my sister.
Geoffrey bit her, didn' t he?
She' s turning.
Yes.
Then it' s too late.
Is it too late for your son?
I' il tell them about Geoffrey.
I swear it.
They kill my sister, they kill your son.
Hold her still!
Get a leech.
- Let her go!
- You heard her.
Let her go.
- Bled out his throat.
She never left the room.
She never left her sister' s side.
- Leech the witch!
I suggest you lower your weapon, or I will, by God, introduce you to him.
This plague has come because of your love for your savage wife.
It is your sin that has brought the devil upon us.
My sin is something you can only dream about.
Leech her.
It' s the only way we' re gonna know.
Murphy, don' t.
You' re insane.
No one touches either of these two without my order.
Is that understood?
Get out!
It' s all right.
Pack your things.
You' re making us leave?
You can stay.
She goes.
Brigitte, I have to break the curse.
We go... we go together.
I have to kill Geoffrey.
I' m not staying here without you.
There' s no other way.
He must die by my hand.
I don' t know where we' il go, but we' il go together.
Brigitte, look at me.
Some other way, something we don' t know about.
I' m turning into something dangerous.
You know it' s true.
You heard the old woman.
You' re the only thing I have.
Nothing else.
I will not kill you.
Forever... nothing else.
I love you, Brigitte.
No!
No, no!
No one left to protect you, little half- breed.
Your father' s throat' s out!
- Get the gate!
You' re going out, like the dirty little mongrel mutt you are!
Please no!
Get up!
Get out!
Get the beam.
Geoffrey?
Shh, it' s all right.
You miss her, don' t you?
I' m sure she misses you too.
There' s something in the graveyard!
Run!
- Where is she?
- She' s gone.
It' s too dangerous for you here.
What do you want?
I' ve known you before I found you in the woods.
Since I was a boy, I' ve seen your face in dreams.
I' ve prepared my whole life to meet with you.
- The dreams told me to protect you.
- And kill my sister.
I could' ve, many times.
I am forbidden to kill her.
The seer believes our fates are tied together.
- You know the old woman?
- She' s an elder with sight.
Come with me and she will show us the truth.
I' m waiting for my sister.
She' s one of them.
I' ve hunted this creature' s bloodline for years.
They live only to kill!
I' m staying until my sister comes back.
Watch her carefully.
Soon not even her love for you will stop her.
Wallace!
- Wallace!
- They found the boy.
- What is that?
- It' s Wallace' s boy.
He' s alive.
And he' s turned.
Turned ugly.
Wallace come out here.
Having a little reunion.
Wallace, get out here!
Wallace!
Good news, Chief.
Your boy' s back from the dead.
You' ve been telling us lies!
He' s my son, he' s my responsibility.
He' s not your son anymore.
You fucked us.
You haven' t just killed Murphy.
You killed everyone here.
- It' s my concern.
- What about Murphy' s concern?
And Finn' s?
He killed Seamus.
For good or bad, I' m in command!
Well, I think it' s time that changed.
Take him!
No!
I couldn' t kill him, now it' s too late.
I' m afraid, Brigitte.
It' s over.
Mutiny' s over.
- And that one?
- She' s leaving.
We two owe each other nothing.
Say your goodbyes.
We have to find the old woman.
We' il take our chances and travel by day in the woods.
We wait until the watch changes, and then we go out the way the beast got in.
By the time they come for you, we' il already be gone.
Keep pulling!
Therefore the curse is brought upon us.
- I' m not.
We have to keep moving.
Ginger!
We have to find the hunter.
Shhh, shh.
What is it?
Someone' s watching us.
Hello?
Milo.
I know you' re afraid, but can you help us find the hunter?
- His cave is up the river.
- Take us to him.
Can you do that?
We' re very close.
- What do you hear?
- They' re stalking us.
- This way, hurry!
- Milo, wait!
Milo?
Milo?
Ginger?
Brigitte, I couldn' t help it.
I did it.
You need to leave me.
- Come on, come on.
- Brigitte...
I' il kill you.
I' il kill you.
Come on, Ginger, up!
There... the cave.
Shh, it' s all right.
No, it' s over.
It' s over, we' re dead.
We' re dead.
We' re not dead, we' re here.
We' ve come this far.
In my mother...
I heard you coming.
Tell us how to cure this.
I warned you.
It' s too late.
The curse is in the blood.
Kill the boy before he bit you.
Please help us.
Tell us what to do.
And with them came the Wendigo.
This was all foretold, watched for.
And with the Wendigo would come two sisters, the Red and the Black.
And their love and their deaths would decide the way of things.
I' m gonna kill you, Brigitte.
No, you won' t.
I know it.
Snow.
She is offering you "machya buwat moon."
The night and the day come into you and your spirit runs forward.
You will see things.
- Will I see what happens to us?
- You will see your death.
But will I find the answer?
Snow.
Don' t do this, Brigitte.
I need to know.
Do not fear death.
I love you, Brigitte.
No!
Ginger!
Ginger?
What happened?
She killed the seer.
I went in to protect you and she ripped out her throat.
Now tell me what you saw.
Tell me!
I didn' t see my death.
I saw Ginger' s.
And it was you that killed her, wasn' t it?
It' s what I saw.
And what did you see?
I saw myself die.
I give my life to save you... so that you can kill her.
It' s still her.
We will be together.
She will come back to me.
She has to die by your hand.
And what if I don' t?
What if I don' t kill her?
She dies by your hands, or you die by hers and the land suffers forever as foretold.
I just want my sister back.
You saw this knife.
- I know you saw it.
- I killed Ginger with it.
This is the only way.
You have no choice.
It is your path.
Do not fear death.
We go to the fort and wait for her.
The prodigal has returned.
Welcome back.
You bastard!
It is an eternity of peace, and it is this forgiveness which I offer you.
Take it, child.
For the lost soul of your sister, take it.
I have seen things... in dreams and in waking... about the way things will be for her and I.
And in these dreams, Reverend... you are screaming for your life, you prick!
She' s coming for me.
Witch!
Temptress!
- Disciple of the devil!
- No longer will your evil tempt us. - three... four, five...
If you will not beg for mercy, mercy shall be inflicted upon you.
The other will come.
Let the bitch in.
- You were born of the fire...
- 37... and to the fire you shall return.
- I' ve come for my sister.
- I' m sorry to tell you, but the Reverend has taken a real fancy to saving her from hellfire.
So I guess that leaves me and you more or less to ourselves.
Right then.
Burn her, Wallace, while there' s still time.
Burn her!
You hit like a girl.
Well, we' ve got all night to fix that.
You' ve let a pair of little girls destroy us.
You never could see how they lied and tricked and tempted you into oblivion, man, just like that bitch wife of yours.
Forgive me, Father... for I have sinned.
48...
Have you had enough?
You finished yet?
Or does your pretty little mouth have something more to say?
Let' s hear it!
Come closer.
It' s a secret.
Watch her!
She' s come back for you.
Stay close to the fire.
98...
99...
100.
Ginger?
Behind you!
I was wrong to leave you, Brigitte.
But you came back.
I' m cold.
I' m not.
The day of reckoning... the day the curse grew stronger in the Red and the Black.
Sisters united in blood, together forever.

Miss, you okay?
I can`t remember when I had my first waking nightmare.
They`re too disturbing to caII daydreams.
I never talked about them with anyone.
They never made any sense to me... then I found the Pathway.
Now they`re aII clear, every one of them.
Breakfast of champions.
When was the last time you slept?
I`m happy I can stand, man.
I`m on a three- day rage.
Your father will kick your ass if you flunk anything.
Since when did he need an excuse to do that?
At least you`re out of the house.
Hey, l`d trade places with you any day.
- What up, Jake?
- Darius.
What`s up?
So you playing ball next year?
- I don`t know, man.
- Get with it.
That`s what you said last term, dawg.
Man, the guys around the gym, they tell me you`re the real deal.
- What are you staring at?
- It ain`t your truck, homey.
- Easy.
- What`s he got there, Jake?
- Nothing, man.
- Bullshit.
Let it go.
- Just keep your dog on a leash.
- All right.
What the fuck were you gonna do, shoot him?
Chill.
It only told me to scare him. ``lt``?
What is ``it``?
Just give me back the piece.
Are you crazy?
What, do you want to get arrested?
Where did you get this?
Later.
Happy birthday.
Joseph Campbell believed that the power of myth... related to certain intrinsic universal values found in all cultures: the need to worship God, to protect the family... to coexist in harmony with nature.
Now, from these very ideas stories were created... and passed down from one generation to another... each having its own central hero character.
Want to see what you missed?
lf I wanted to see it, I wouldn`t have missed it.
Campbell termed this ennobled path --
- Just trying to be helpful.
- What a shame.
I thought you wanted to get in my pants.
It is my birthday.
Works for me.
But little more than the stories we grow up hearing... and the tradition of telling them... is what binds together even the most disparate of societies.
Happy birthday, handsome.
- How does it feel to be 21?
- Like l`m on the verge of nothing.
Mr. Gray, am I interrupting a celebration?
Sorry, Prof. Hartney.
Tell me, Dakota, what are we to make of this Dionysian offering?
Mimosas.
All right.
That`s enough for today.
Thank you.
- So we drinking this tonight?
- We`il be doing a lot more than that.
Dakota.
ln my office in 30 minutes.
Get me out of this town.
You must be Jake.
How did you know that?
Hey, Jake, this lady needs help with her laptop, okay?
What`s the problem?
It just stopped working.
They do that.
Okay, let`s see.
- That`s what it looks like in there.
- What did you expect?
Lots of little guys running around doing my errands for me.
Okay.
You`ve got some red wax.
Wax.
My tarot cards.
- Sorry?
- I burn candles when I read tarot, so....
They help you see into the future, right?
Yeah, and the past.
Okay.
It works.
- What do I owe you?
- No charge.
- Yeah.
That`s so nice.
Thank you.
Jake.
You could have got $75 for that job.
- It was a piece of wax.
- Yeah?
Well, l`m docking your salary.
What the hell for?
Because your time is my money.
And please, watch your fucking language.
Aren`t you going to blow it out?
Are you going to sing me ``Happy Birthday``?
I stopped singing the day they kicked me out of the church choir.
Did you go see your mother?
No.
She wasn`t feeling well today, so l`il go see her tomorrow.
How are things going at the mill?
Still got a job.
They`d have to close the place down if they got rid of you.
Thanks.
You going out tonight with Conrad and Dakota?
l`m legal.
They look up to you, Jake.
But they`re still caught in the rain.
What does that mean?
Don`t get wet.
What`s your poison, lover boy?
- Are you peaking or crying?
- l`ve had better days, Jake.
- So what happened?
- Hartney hit on me again.
- What did he say?
- Fuck or fail.
That`s got a nice ring to it.
Well, I ran out of the office.
I bought myself a few days.
Why don`t you report him?
He does this all the time.
- Dean Glick won`t do anything.
- Why not?
l`il give you one guess.
Come on, huh?
Shit.
Fuck. l`il fucking nail both of you, man?
- I didn`t call for back up.
- You`re welcome.
So, Valerie Gaines, behind the gym... senior prom.
You guys thought that we were powdering our noses.
Her nose was up my skirt.
Man!
Jake, what`s our zip code?
98133.
Had you heard that one?
Personally, I found it depressing.
That`s just because you weren`t there.
Exactly.
What year were you born?
Same as you, dumb- ass.
So what`s your weirdest family holiday?
Fuck that.
We`il be here all night.
What was your weirdest family holiday?
Thanksgiving, a couple years ago.
I was building a ramp for my mom`s wheelchair... and Father Moore came by to visit.
They were all inside watching football, Dallas- Tampa game.
Dallas lost.
That was your weirdest family holiday?
So I had a hammer in my hand... and I look up and Father Moore was smiling at me... and all I could think about is just bashing his head in.
Over and over, and then l`d smash my parents` heads in.
Then, like, half the people I knew, just....
So then I started thinking, what else would I like to do?
And all this crazy shit came into my head.
So then what happened?
I finished the ramp, and we ate turkey.
Dude, that`s sick even for me.
Dude, l`ve castrated my dad 1 1 2 times in my dreams.
Three of a kind, huh?
Let`s play a real fucked- up game.
``Welcome to The Pathway. ``
The Pathway.
l`ve never played this before.
Dakota, it`s a secret.
Well, it`s not a very good secret if you know about it.
Serious.
You give it your phone numbers and stuff... then it calls you and gives you bizarre things to do.
What kind of bizarre things?
Well, you don`t know unless you play.
- How do you start?
- You already have.
Happy birthday.
Oh, shit. lt`s, like, my entire life.
Wild or what?
Dude, you`il never be President.
Somebody could be reading this.
Nobody cares about the $243 you got left in your bank account.
Abort.
Fuck!
God, l`m so drunk.
I need another drink.
Oh, body shots.
- l`il be down in a minute.
- Enjoy.
What are you doing?
Your charity case dropped that off for you.
Did she leave a number?
What do I look like, a secretary?
By the way, you`re fired.
I was 10 minutes late.
Look, my nephew got out of rehab, all right.
He needs a job.
- So do l.
- Oh, I don`t know.
Sell pot like my nephew did.
He made a killing before he got busted.
I need the keys.
You`ve got to be kidding me.
You know, you owe me two weeks pay.
Sue me.
Son of a....
What?
Your boss fires you and aII you do is hit a desk?
Who is this?
I know what the voices in your head reaIly teII you to do.
I don`t have time to play games.
You wouldn`t have Iet Conrad sign you on... if you weren`t Iooking for a distraction from your dreary world.
Happy birthday.
This is the Pathway?
Today we find a way to get even with an asshole of your choosing.
- Have anybody in mind?
- My boss.
- What would you Iike to do to him?
- Kill him.
You`d only be doing him a favor.
Enjoy your first day off... then come back tomorrow and see what the Pathway does for you.
Somebody order an orchid?
Don`t expect a tip.
So you been thinking about me?
Only between my dance classes.
- How are you doing?
- l`m good.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
How`s your job going?
lt`s going great.
You and your dad getting along?
Yeah, like family.
That bad, huh?
Maybe I should move back home.
This place is breaking us.
There`d be no one to look after you all day.
Dad and I are fine.
You were always such a terrible liar.
Where`s your blanket?
l`m going to get you a blanket.
Hang on.
Excuse me, nurse.
Can we get a blanket for my....
- Marisol.
- Jake.
What are you doing here?
You two know each other?
Yeah, she came into the computer shop.
Jake saved my life.
It was just a circuit board.
So you`re the one that brings Kathy the orchids?
Yeah.
- You wanted a blanket. l`il get you blanket.
- Thanks for the cards.
- You`re welcome.
- Small world, huh?
I like it that way, though.
Behave, Mom.
Why should I start now?
There he is.
That`s the kid that robbed me.
- Arrest him.
- Take it easy.
He comes back last night and rips me off.
I just came by to get my money.
He owes me two weeks pay.
- Were you in here last night?
- No.
Okay.
All right.
You know what?
Let`s check out the hidden surveillance cameras and we`il see what we see.
Didn`t know we had those, did you, Jake?
l`m just going to start this from when I left here last night.
What the....
That can`t be me.
You doctored the tape.
You little prick.
Don`t you see?
He`s goddamn smart.
God, you screwed me, Gray!
How`d you do it, huh?
So then who were those guys on the videotape?
That`s why l`m trying to hack into the site.
Well, whoever they are, I wouldn`t piss them off.
Yeah.
Shit.
Since when are you into voodoo?
They`re spiritual interpretations of universal ideas.
That`s what it said on the box.
So what did it have to say about these guys?
``The figures suggest youth, love, and virginity... ``before they`re corrupted by desire. ``
Remember taking my virginity?
lf I recall, I think it was you that took mine.
Details.
Should we light a candle or something?
So much for cuddling.
Well, Jake, you got what you wanted... and I get to keep playing the Pathway.
You just made love to me because the Pathway told you to?
No, Jake, I fucked you because the Pathway told me to.
When did you start playing the Pathway?
Like you care.
Like you`ve ever really given a shit about me, Jake.
Like any man ever has.
See you on campus.
Hello.
Feeling distracted?
Beats watching TV.
Are you ready for another test?
I thought that was Dakota`s test.
Besides, it`s not exactly our first time.
With her in controI it was.
I thought the point was to entertain me.
No, the point was to see what`s inside your head.
Dinner`s ready.
Trying to break my hand?
What`s the matter, you pull something?
Just throw the goddamn ball.
Let me see.
- Darius do that?
- With a little help.
Damn it, Connie, I can`t baby- sit you day and night.
Who asked you to?
Don`t give me that shit. l`ve been covering your back since we were nine.
Why don`t you stop already?
Okay.
Sorry, man.
I think l`m building up a resistance to my medication.
Yeah, I think we`re both losing it.
Listen to this shit.
I get a phone call from the Pathway.
I turn around.
There`s a big creature staring at me.
A creature.
Half man, half woman.
Anyway, I have this dream where I go upstairs... and I shoot my dad in the back of the head.
Has trippy stuff like that been happening to you?
Every goddamn day.
Great.
- l`il take it easy on you.
- Right.
- Hello.
- Lakey.
Got two girls in my room.
- I can`t get them to leave.
- Nice, man.
Why didn`t you give me a shout?
Yeah, like l`m going to have you by.
They would have taken one look at you and kicked my ass out of bed.
ls something wrong?
You know?
Be careful.
Why don`t we get breakfast in the morning?
I`II caII you in the morning.
- Hey, Jake.
- Yeah.
Fuck you.
Dude, what the fuck do you want now?
Nobody knows how fucked up you reaIly are.
And nobody reaIly gives a fuck, do they?
What the fuck!
Connie.
Connie, let`s go get some breakfast, bud.
Or more like lunch.
Connie, wake up.
Uncle Ross.
He didn`t sound good.
I should have come over.
You could have wound up dead, too.
Conrad wasn`t a psychopath.
He was always on the edge.
This thing with Darius just pushed him over it.
No.
Those guys would fight one day, and then they`d get high the next.
l`m sure their parents will be comforted to hear that.
Did you help Conrad steal that gun?
What?
The serial numbers matched a. 38 stolen from Sid`s Sporting Goods last week.
- That`s impossible.
- Why is that?
- Because I threw that gun into Cove Lake.
- You what?
I took a gun from Connie....
I didn`t want him to get in trouble, so I threw it in the lake.
How would Conrad have gotten the gun back?
He couldn`t have.
This is a bad time to start lying to me.
l`m not lying to you.
You think I don`t want to find out what went on in there?
You going to tell my sister or am l?
Yeah, I want to go to the hospital now, if I can.
You know, l`m your uncle.
You could have brought the gun to me.
Are you okay?
lt`s the worst day of my life.
You want to talk about it?
Not here.
Meet me in front in five minutes.
Okay?
Okay.
I just don`t want to end up like my father.
Go to work at 6: 00, come home at 8: 00.
Do it all over again the next day.
What do you want to do?
- I wish I knew.
- Have you ever thought about leaving here?
- Who`d bring my mom orchids?
- l`m sure she would love postcards.
Looks like you like to travel.
Yeah.
I like collecting things.
- How did you end up here?
- A man.
Sorry, I didn`t mean to pry.
No, it`s okay.
l`m just enjoying this one too much.
So how about you?
Are you seeing anybody?
Took you long enough to ask.
- I take that as a no.
- No.
But who knows, I could always run into someone when l`m not expecting it.
That never happens.
All I want to do is leave this town, and you just got here.
We just have to meet somewhere in the middle.
Okay.
Well, you were right.
The day did get better.
l`m sorry about your friend.
So l`m going to try to play it cool and not call you for at least an hour, okay?
Bye, Jake.
Bye.
I remember when you and Connie first met in Sunday school.
You`re drinking?
Well, l`m not praying.
You`re going to throw away five years just like that?
You think I don`t know what you and Conrad have been doing to yourselves, Son?
You think I don`t know that?
What Conrad did has nothing to do with me.
He`s gone to hell.
I don`t have to listen to this.
Wait just a minute, Jake.
Wait.
We`re not going to be able to save you now.
Don`t preach to me with a drink in your hand, Dad.
You ungrateful punk.
You realize that we have sacrificed everything for you here?
Sacrificed?
You sacrificed?
I could`ve gone anywhere, I could`ve done anything... but I stayed here for you, I stayed here for Mom.
What did you ever give up for me?
My beautiful wife.
What does that mean?
- I thought I could do this, but I can`t.
- Thought you could do what?
What are you trying to tell me?
You`re blaming me for the way Mom is... for the accident?
You`re gonna blame me for that now?
The day after my best friend kills himself, you`re gonna blame me for that?
lt`s not very much, though, Jake.
The day I need you the most, the day I need help, the day I need my father... you do this?
Shame on you.
Jake?
I don`t know whether to cry or scream.
I know what you mean.
You know, I called you six times.
l`m really sorry about what happened the other night.
Don`t worry about it.
- So why didn`t you call me back?
- I was hanging out with a friend.
Who is she?
Her name is Marisol.
- Sounds exotic.
- She`s different.
- l`m super late.
- Dakota, hey.
You heard what Conrad did to himself, right?
Can`t stop thinking about it.
Well, the other night, after I got off the phone with the Pathway...
I had a dream where I did the same thing to myself.
You think that the Pathway has something to do with what Conrad did to himself?
Yeah, maybe.
Are you still playing?
It hasn`t asked me to corrupt anyone else, if that`s what you`re asking.
Do me a favor.
- Anything.
- Stop.
Sure.
Come by the Tomahawk tonight.
Dinner`s on me.
And bring your friend.
You sure you want company tonight?
- No, but I like being with you.
- Good.
Okay, now l`m jealous.
- Marisol, this is Dakota.
- Nice to meet you.
That`s such a beautiful name.
- Thank you.
- What does it mean?
- lt`s Spanish for ``sun and sea. ``
Oh, my parents named me for where I was conceived.
I would really love to stay here and chat with you guys... but my boss is totally riding my ass.
lt`s okay.
We`re just going to do take- out.
So two burgers, two fries, and two beers.
- We`re not staying?
I got a surprise for you.
Now this would be the part where I get ill.
Looking for the men`s room.
You know where the men`s room is, Professor.
You eat here twice a week.
So, have you thought about our little conversation after class?
Professor, you twist that ring any harder, and your finger`s going to come off.
l`ve got plenty more.
Asshole!
- Tomahawk.
- Even Hartney knows you are weak.
Every man does.
Why do you think Lake would never be with you for more than one night?
He knows you`ve fucked aII his friends.
Who wants a girI Iike that?
It wasn`t your fault.
Daddy was a monster.
But then, Iet`s face it.
Lots of girls have bad fathers, and they don`t end up Iike you.
Get used to it.
You Iet Hartney fuck you over... and you`re going to be working in dumps Iike this for the rest of your miserable Iife.
- Is that what you want?
- Fuck you.
Fuck all of you!
That`s my girl.
Didn`t that feeI good?
Don`t you understand that I want to help you... make you feeI better... help you get even with Hartney before it`s too Iate.
Yes.
Don`t be afraid.
It`s time to play.
When I was nine months old, my folks moved here from Seattle... to be near my uncle, my mother`s brother.
There was a blizzard and my dad lost control of the car.
It was a miracle any of us survived.
There`s a higher power looking out for you.
ls she okay?
- l`il call her later.
We are late.
- Late for what?
I promise.
I need some more medicine, nurse.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
One, two, three, go.
I hope you can fight.
I never put an orchid on a guy before.
lt`s for my mother, Walt.
Okay, now you`re breaking my heart.
Sorry.
Quit smoking yesterday.
Great.
Jake.
What have you and your friends gotten into?
Nothing.
First Conrad, now Dakota kills your professor and mutilates herself.
This is no coincidence.
You could be next.
I am not going to let that happen.
All right, can you take him home?
Make sure he gets some sleep?
First thing tomorrow morning, you meet me at my cabin.
No one will disturb us there.
But we`re not leaving until you tell me everything you know.
Uncle Ross.
Nine points?
Didn`t hear you drive in.
So, how are you holding up?
- Fine.
- Yeah?
What`s in the ground?
After a hunt, we bury the animal`s remains.
Native American ritual I taught Jake when he was a kid.
Returns the animal`s soul to the Earth.
Well, come on in.
When we started, the Pathway was just a game... that had this strange ability of knowing what we were thinking.
But then Conrad used the gun that I threw into the lake... and then cuts his tongue off... the way that I did after a beast in a dream tells me to.
So l`m thinking maybe it wasn`t a dream.
Maybe it isn`t just a game.
I feel like l`m going insane.
No, I think you`re just looking for an answer for something so horrible it has none.
I like it here.
lt`s peaceful.
Thanks.
Well, I have to meet the FBl in my office in a couple hours.
l`il ask them to check on this computer game of yours.
Why don`t you spend the night here?
It might do you some good.
Sheriff North.
What is it?
Something`s wrong.
l`m sorry, I think we ought to go.
Okay.
Jake, talk to me.
Shit.
Give rest, O Christ, to your servant with your Saints.
Where sorrow and pain are no more.
Neither sighing, but life everlasting.
You only are immortal, the creator and maker of all.
We are mortal, formed of the earth... and to the earth we shall return.
For so did you ordain when you created us, saying: ``You are dust, and to dust you shall return. ``
All of us go down to the dust... yet even at the grave we make our song.
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.
You know, you say there`s a higher power looking out for me?
He`s not here.
Jake, what is it?
I have to go see an old friend.
Jacob, why this sudden interest in Satan?
Do you think he really exists?
Many in the Church take the Devil quite literally... but I think of him as a symbol of temptation, not as a beast with a pitchfork and horns.
What does it say in the Bible about possession or self- mutilation?
You think that your two friends were possessed?
Maybe.
Here in Mark 9: 25:
``When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene, he rebuked the evil spirit. ```You deaf and mute spirit, ` He said. `l command you to come out of him. ```
Again, sorry about your friend.
Thanks.
So when did you stop worshipping Satan?
Ten years ago. l`m a Christian now.
lt`s more forgiving.
Why`d you even start?
Some folks want what God ain`t giving them:
Power.
Me?
I wanted to get laid.
There`s more pussy at a Black Mass than there is at a Metallica concert.
What happens at a Black Mass?
People get naked.
Then they sacrifice something.
A cat or a dog.
Satan rewards you for killing a dog?
The more you give, the more you get.
What happens if you kill a human?
looking for a different kind of picnic.
Do you know any people that are more devoted?
You don`t cross people who are willing to give up their souls.
Walt, please.
Yeah, I know a guy.
Just do me a favor.
Don`t tell him I sent you.
Coming.
Sammy.
Mr. Reisz, l`m Jake Gray.
I called about an hour ago, said I was coming by.
Yeah.
I get $50 an hour for consultations.
Right.
I should charge more.
The guy who fixes my car gets $80.
Barely knows where the sparkplugs are, much less how to conjure up Beelzebub.
I ever sell books to you before?
No.
You say it`s called the ``Pathway``?
Why?
Because that`s what we call the connection between the Devil and the possessed.
So how did I resist?
We`re often unaware of our strength until we`re tested.
Why does the Devil need to use computers or games?
Think about it.
lt`s a very effective way to spread a message.
I mean, imagine if Hitler had had the lnternet.
Maybe Satan`s found someone to do his bidding again.
l`ve seen this man...
in my head.
So have l.
What makes you think this guy can conjure Satan?
Because I taught him to.
When Aidan Kater came to me to learn the black arts... he was a geek living out of the back of his van.
I stopped teaching a few years later... but by then he was very skilled.
Why did you stop?
I was going to be a father.
Was?
Anne Kilton was a student of mine before we were married.
The pregnancy was hard on her.
She had a bad premonition... and asked me to perform a sacrifice for the health of the baby.
A human sacrifice.
I refused.
So Kater took your place.
I came home one night and found a pentagram in my yard.
There was blood everywhere.
I thought at first: ``Anne must have sacrificed some kind of animal here. ``
But Anne was gone, too.
When they found her bloody clothes in a ditch two days later, I knew...
Aidan Kater had sacrificed my wife and unborn child.
l`m sorry.
What did the police say?
The police were very helpful.
They made me their prime suspect.
I spent the next five years trying to prove that I didn`t do it.
And that`s what I have left to remember them by.
An empty grave.
The Devil uses the Pathway to possess people.
And then forces them to kill... and commit suicide?
She seduces them.
The Devil`s a woman?
I don`t know.
It can be whatever it needs to be.
Or what you want it to be?
I didn`t want it to be a woman.
You think Conrad and Dakota wanted to die like that?
Some part of them did.
You didn`t even know them!
l`m not saying it`s your fault.
I think that you`re angry because --
Yes, l`m angry.
My friends are dead! l`m angry!
But l`m not crazy.
This Kater guy is behind this... and I gotta do something.
I can`t just stand here.
What are you gonna do?
Throw holy water on him?
Burn him at the stake?
You believed me when I said I saw something.
I believed that you had a vision, maybe, or an apparition.
The bitch was in my basement!
You know what?
This is getting a little bit too heavy for me right now.
I adore you, but this is getting to be too much.
I guess I shouldn`t have come here.
l`m sorry.
Fucking shit.
We`re not going to be able to save you now.
You are dust, and to dust you shaII return.
He`s gone to hell.
Where you going with those, Jake?
To your mother and father?
You can`t do that, man.
You`il ruin everything.
Jake.
I didn`t have a choice.
Neither of us do.
Are we in hell?
No.
But hell ain`t so bad.
You`il see.
You know, you remind me of myself when I was your age.
Smart.
Angry.
Trying desperately to pretend that I was something good... but somehow deep down inside knowing you`re not.
l`m nothing like you.
I don`t kill people.
No, you just dream about it.
ls this how you got to Conrad and Dakota?
You mess with their minds until they do what you tell them?
It was a test.
They failed.
You passed.
You stared the Devil directly in the face... and you never looked away.
But when you finally did... we knew that we`d found you.
You used the Pathway to find me?
Why?
Because you were stolen from us... and we needed a way to get you back.
Stolen?
By who?
Those people you call your parents.
They found your mother where she was hiding on the night you were born.
She was too weak to fight them.
You`re insane.
You were taken from your real mother on the night you were born.
My real mother?
Anne Kilton.
Bullshit.
Anne never had a child.
You made sure of that.
Every son wants to believe his father... but faking Anne`s death kept lvan from the truth.
You belong to us.
You always have.
Anne had a plan... but when Paul and Kathy interfered... you went from being a Prince of Darkness... to just another fucked up kid.
Look.
Your whole life is a lie.
Why are you doing this to me?
Why?
Don`t be afraid.
She`il explain everything.
Where is she?
I know who you are now.
Why?
No!
There`s a higher power looking out for you.
I had to make sure my son still belonged to me.
Oh, God.
You had to kill before I could show myself to you.
They took you from me... but l`m sorry I had to do this to you.
That isn`t your blood.
Drink this.
Accept who you were born to be... or go back to the life that you hate.
Will you be with me?
l`il be whatever you need me to be.
You`re a monster.
My God, they think I kiIled them?
The DeviI couldn`t kiII her child, so this is how she makes me pay... for wanting to be human.
But maybe they`re right.
Maybe there is no Pathway.
And this is aII a fantasy I`ve created to Iive with the horrible things I`d done.
Wake me from this nightmare.
Help me.

My heart
hello?
Yes?
Captain!
Yes, we picked him up at the airport.
Yes.
This picture.
You took it, didn' t you?
It was found at the scene.
And you left the country and you left the country on the same day.
This belongs to my son who goes to primary school.
He wrote it on the ground and asked me to shoot it for his girlfriend in class.
And my trip was scheduled last semester.
You took pictures of Ji Kyung- hee.
- Who?
- The female owner of the studio!
- You took her pictures.
- No don' t play hard ball.
You took her pictures!
She asked me to.
Cut the crap!
She brought us pictures you took and told us everything.
She asked me to!
She was so serious I agreed.
It wasn' t porn.
I took nude pictures of her.
Is that a crime?
Nude?
You took nude pictures of her?
So you' re telling me ji kyung- hee asked you to take pictures of her in the nude?
Look, detective.
I have a family.
Honestly, it' s embarrassing... to even be here.
Kyung- hee, right?
I think she had a crush on me.
I' m sorry.
I was testing my camera.
Why didn' t you tell me?
I could' ve been your model.
Anything wrong?
You memorized my name and phone number!
Of course you come every week!
Why' d you take pictures of your feet?
Of all the pictures, she showed so much interest in my nude ones.
Why' d you keep going back?
You' re a man.
Put yourself in my shoes.
She' s pretty and mysterious.
It' s not a bad thing for a girl to be aggressive.
So I kind of enjoyed it.
You play at a concert hall, and I sing at a basement cafe.
We' ve turned out so differently.
- Tomato juice?
- For her.
Coffee is mine.
Thanks.
Why not drinking it?
It' s pretty good.
Try it.
You' re seeing ki- hoon lately?
Change the subject.
I' ve had enough.
With what?
- Ka- hee, please...
- please what?
Tell me.
You like the way you live?
Didn' t you tell me?
Taking pictures frees your soul...... like a little boy.
Please.
She said her husband was out of town and asked me to take pictures of her in the nude.
I thought it was too much so I refused at first.
Then again, I sometimes hire a professional model, and she was volunteering.
So you did?
Mind giving me one?
Don' t you like the thrill?
I do.
Getting there... is more fun than being there.
Don' t you have that experience?
Fucking is good, but the feeling after you come...
I didn' t sleep with her.
- Talk to me.
- Yes sir.
It' s true he was at the library.
His library card confirms it.
What if he lent it to someone?
Keep digging for witnesses.
And check out his wife too.
- Yes sir - okay.
What now?
You know what?
It' s quite boring sitting alone at the studio.
He started keeping me company... and I was glad.
Even thankful.
That was the beginning.
Hands at first.
Then the shoulders.
What do you think it meant?
Maybe... he wanted to sleep with me.
Tell him about our rule.
One more for the loser!
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
Come on!
You lost!
One more shot!
Sorry about that.
Give it here.
- Captain - what?
Let me drink just beer.
Shut up.
You don' t mix liquor.
But once you do, you go all the way.
Take a note!
1. you don' t mix liquor.
2. shut up and drink.
Whoever finishes last gets one more.
- Okay - sure.
Ka- hee.
It' s me.
Finger on the pad please.
Try again please.
Finger on the pad please.
Try again please.
What the... ka- hee!
It' s me!
Open the door!
Ka- hee!
It isn' t easy for me either.
I can' t even buy you the ring you want so badly.
Su- hyun got an abortion without me knowing.
So open the goddamn door!
Open it!
It' s me!
- Su- hyun, i...
- please.
I want a divorce.
19 seconds.
Gosh, you waited... for too long.
I' m so sorry.

I heard she works at a cafe called purte.
I met the studio owner through my boss.
He offered to buy me... an apartment if I gave him a child.
It wasn' t killing a baby, but giving life to one.
But Hyuk- ju completely lost it when I told him.

I had spent two more days with Ka- hee.
The smell of her blood...
I told the police she had killed herself.
Nightmares haunt you forever.
When do you wanna move by?
The faster, the better.
It might take a while to find a buyer with the economy so sluggish.
- I' m counting on you.
- Sure I' il give you a call.
- Okay.
Bye.
- Bye
I' m selling the studio.
I can' t run it alone.
I' ve left the force.
I can' t believe I put away the wrong guy.
Then again, he' s been in jail.
He' il do just fine.
It' s all over.
Is this called 'our lady of grace'?
Different names for different postures, right?
Tell me.
What can I do?
Kyung- hee, I love you you said it wasn' t for me.
I checked with the school his son goes to.
No girl named Kyung- hee in his class.
It doesn' t matter now.
Jung Myung- sik... did you love him?
If I loved him...
if I loved him, I' m forgiven?
Why aren' t you ready?
I' m tired, sir.
Do you wish to quit?
If your mission is to quit, there' s no better time than right now.
You can quit now, get it over with.
I can' t catch her.
I understand.
Just take those numbers off and put them in my hand.
Forget that!
You better catch her.
- Well done.
- Sir.
Well done.
- I don' t even know why I did it.
- Yeah, well...... you know what Napoleon said:
- "Give me a man who' s lucky."
- Yes, sir.
Knife fighting.
Don' t you teach them knife fighting.
Teach them to kill.
That way they meet some son of a bitch studied knife fighting...... they send his soul to hell.
It' s all in the mind, sergeant.
That' s where the battle' s won.

His post was Harvard Yard.

- Yes, sir.
Okay, then.
Once again.
She had lunch with her father.
Lunch with her father.
You were seconded to that?
- No, sir, I just had her.
- You just had her?
I had her all day.
Tucked her in at 1 0.
And she --
Yeah, she had a tiff with her boyfriend, Michael Blake.
- What was it about?
- I think it was about her....
So it wasn' t a serious...?
No.
- And then I held the post until relieved.
- Well, then we' ve got a little problem.
I was there.
231 2 hours, 1 9 May, Harvard Yard, northeast corner, Lowell House...... reveals no Secret Service presence.
Neither his post, nor adjacent.
A second tour, 2330, reveals similarly.
- I was there, sir.
- Who' s lying, you or him?
You son of a bitch, I got 1 5 years in.
I got two kids.
You' re not gonna sit there and lie away my pension.

You son of a bitch!

Let' s get the clock up, please.
We got until her Monday- morning class, then it' s Meet the Press and "Where is she?"
The professor.
Who' s got the professor?
- Where is he?
- Martha' s Vineyard.
- Who' s got him?
- Parr and Shannon.
Wake him up, shake him up.
Show them to his wife.
- We got the state cops on the scrambler.
- The photo.
This is the last known photo of the girl.
Sir!
It' s the professor.
- You had him at his home.
- We were in error.
- Where is he?
- Best guess puts him on his boat.
Last seen, West Tisbury, Martha' s Vineyard.

Find him.
Put the guard on him.
Get me an overflight.
- I hear you.
- I' m 25 men light here.

Coast Guard Search and Rescue.
Coast Guard on the red phone.

He' s moving.

Now.

Hold surveillance.
I' ve got two days to run in before the press wakes up.
Yes, sir.
Let me see your hands, son.
Right now.
Drop it.
Did you lose your mailbox key, son?
- You a student here?
- Yes.
Can I see some identification, please?
- Section 1 2, this is -- - No, please.
Please.
Calm down.
It' s gonna be what it' s gonna be.
Can I talk to you for one minute?
Just one minute, all right?
This -- It' s not what it looks like.
I broke up with my girlfriend.
This is her mailbox.
It' s Laura.
- Laura Newton.
- Laura?
- Yes.
- Newton?
The Laura Newton?
That' s right.
We broke up.
- They know who I am.
- They?
- The Secret Service.
- Secret Service?
That' s right.
They know who I am.
They cleared me.
They didn' t clear you for this.
Let' s go.
- Okay -- - Let' s go.
- I was just trying to retrieve the letter.
- This is not very nice language.
"You deserve everything that' s gonna happen to you."
What' s gonna happen to her?
Did you hurt her?
Did you hit her?
Hit her?
No.
- I called her a whore.
- What' s this sign?
What does this sign mean?
Right here.
She signs all of her letters with that.
It' s because she...
-... sees things cockeyed, like Picasso.
- Picasso.
She says they call her Picasso.
Why did you fight with her, son?
She got her hair done.
Dyed it blond.
She cut it off.
I called her a slut.
Wait.
We' ve all seen the pictures.
Beautiful young girl like that...... what do you care what color she dyes her hair?
Now why does that make her a slut?
She' s fucking another guy.
You want to talk about it?
If you want to talk about it, I will give you one minute.
Nothing hurts worse than that, if she' s sleeping with another guy.
There' s this....
This teacher that....
I shouldn' t be telling you this.
She' s sleeping with a teacher?
Well, she says she isn' t.
I said if she wants to fuck old men, she should go to the Back Light, go all the way.
- Back Light?
- Yeah.
It' s this club by the Fenway.
It' s like a joke at school, like a rumor.
This girl or that girl went with a businessman for one night...... made a thousand bucks.
This is a lovers' quarrel, all right?
I said something that I regret.
I sent a note that I regret.
I can assure you, officer...... if you see your way clear to give me a break, it' il never....
The Back Light.
It' s a club in the Fenway.
A club in the Fenway.
No note.
The parents?
The mother, you know where she is.
She' s a drunk.
He' s holding up.
- He was in town yesterday to see her.
- He was?
- How long were they together?
- Parker.
- One second.
- He copped to it.
- Copped to what?
Left his post.
Punched out early to go boffing his girlfriend.
Hope she was worth it.
- Sir.
- All right.
Let' s get back on it.
Okay.
Back Light.
A restaurant, The Black Night...... The Black Light, a bar, a supper club.
Black Light, that' s it.
Put up the graphics on the girl.
Take a look at this.
We ran it up from a description of the colorist from the beauty parlor.
Show him what we got.
Transport is under command of State.
We refer to section two.
Yeah, I understand.
- May I have your jacket?
- Right, I got it.
Yeah.
Get their guys off the perimeter.
Get our guys in.
I need $5000.
- Annie.
- I heard it, $5000.
- Scraping the bottom of the barrel, huh?
- Yes, sir.
Five thousand dollars.
Need you to sign for it.
You sign for it.
All right.
- What happened to your wedding ring?
- I took it off.
Did you go off your wife?
No, sir, I' m working.
Keep your mouth shut, your eyes open.
And form on me.
Move aside.
Move aside!
Oh, Jesus.
Who saw it?
I believe he had a hideout piece.
Who frisked him?
Who frisked the son of a bitch?
The girl he went to see, get her in.
The one he was fucking.
- Two guys to her house, right now.
- Seal the room off.
Check out the file.
Seal the room off.
He was off post when he snatched the girl?
Yeah, well, apparently he felt bad about it.
- Show me a set of keys.
- I ain' t got them.
Here, you take the chain.
You' ve got the over- watch.
Swing the chain.
You' re a guy walking the dog.
Loosen your collar.
Told me 2: 00.
It' s closing time, gents.
Time to pack it up.
Don' t gotta go home, but you can' t stay here.
Closing up.
Can' t sell booze after 2 a. m.
No, I just wanted to pay you that money I owe you.
- How about them Sox, huh?
- Yeah, what are you gonna do?
Yeah.
"Curse of the Bambino," isn' t that what you call it?
That' s right.
Where are you from?
Yeah, well, actually, I was just trying to find my niece.
Because a lot of guys come in here looking for someone else' s niece.
Girl like that...... been in tonight?
- Pretty girl.
- Yeah, that' s my type.
Girl like that been in?
You sure you' re looking for your niece?
Because a lot of guys come in here and go home with some rather younger girl.
No, no.
Why --?
Why would...... a younger girl like that want to be with a guy like me?
Howdy, pard.
I was wondering if I could ask you a favor.
I love you, baby, but the season' s over.
Your friend said you were sort of a matchmaker.
Look, you can' t believe everything you hear.
- Catch you later.
- You know it.
Okay, lock it up.
Drive safely, now.
- Yeah?
- I was looking for a girl.
For a young girl.
Well, aren' t we all?
My question was, why would a young, pretty girl like that...... go out with a guy like me?
And if you could answer that....
Look, bub....
What is this?
What' s this?
It' s Rohypnol, is it?
Is this Ro?

- What' s that for?
- I think you broke my arm!
- Where' s the girl?
I think you broke my arm!
Now it' s broken.
Where is the girl, Jerry?
I never saw that girl.
Where' s the girl?
Where did you take her?
Where did you take this girl, Jerry?
That' s not the girl.
Where did you take this girl, Jerry?
Take your knife out.
Where did you take the girl, Jerry?
Take his eye out.
You bet your life.
Wait!
I took the girl.
I took the girl to....
Three units remain on the perimeter until further instructions.
The sniper is to stand down.
Plainclothes, transport in the south alley.
I got it.

We run an escort service.
There is no illegality.
- Who is she?
- Nadya Tellich.
Green card, five years ago.
They sign a contract with us for personal services...... and they pay us so much for each call, and the girls pay us.
- They show you proof of their age?

What do you think?
- Have you seen this girl?
- I have not.
Here' s the first one.
Was this girl here?
She' s new.
This is her first night.
How about that?
Put some fucking clothes on.
I want my lawyer.
You don' t need one.
We need the girl.
Give us the girl.
This girl was not here.
I' m entitled to my lawyer.
You' re entitled to shit.
You' re entitled to tell me what you know.
If the girl was here...... if you cooperate, I' il see what I can do.
I think I can help you, if you tell me now.
Why would I not tell you if the girl was here?
The girl is new.
They told us that it was her first night.
But look here.
There' s two pinholes in the photo.
They moved it over.
Photo' s missing.
Where is she?
- I don' t want to get in trouble.
- You don' t know what trouble is.
I' m not even sure that was her.
She was sick.
She was not very well.
- She came in here and....
- She came here?
They took her.
I told Nadya she shouldn' t be here.
They took her.
Who is "they"?
They took her?
Where did they take her?
Honey, you got all the slack in the world until I leave this room.
And then I' m going to zero you out.
Two men.
They gave her a shot.
I think that was her.
- Where is she?
- I' m entitled to my rights.
- I' m entitled to my phone call.
- You don' t understand.
You' il leave your life, or you' il leave the information in this room.
Where is the girl?
They' il kill me.
Who did you call?
How did you know to come pick her up?
How did they know to get her?
Who did you call?
It' s just a number --
Write it down.
Write it down.
I' m gonna see what I can do.
Just give me the number.
I don' t understand.
She' s just some girl.
Oh, my God.
They don' t know who they' ve got.
Sir.
Where' s the girl?
Sir, we believe she was abducted from this club.
That she was taken to --
That she was taken to a bordello.
- Here in Boston?
- Yes, sir, and that -- That --
- Let' s hear it.
- She may have been delivered for sale.
May have been sent down the pipeline, overseas.
- To get to her father?
- No, sir.
We believe they don' t know who she is...... that they just took some girl.
- Just some girl.
- Yes, sir.
How certain are you she was the girl in the whorehouse?
- We -- - She dyed her hair.
They see that red hair....
What do they do, her hair grows out, when they see that red hair...... somebody recognizes her?
What do they do when they realize who they took?
They kill her.
Okay.
Now, let' s talk some common sense.
Who is he?
What can you do for me?
What can you do for me?
I need it now.
I need it before the press gets it on Monday, because they will kill her.
The press gets this, the jackals start a feeding frenzy, and she' s dead.
Help me.
This is the number of a public phone in downtown Boston.
It' s a cutout between the bordello and the abductors.
A call is placed when they have a package.

In the city, always a reflection.
In the woods, always a sound.

Clear.
Well, I hope you both feel better in the morning.
Good night.
- Does an Alan Palmer live here?
- Yes, my husband' s at work.
- This is just a routine check, Mrs. Palmer.
We have a license- plate number, but we 're not sure of the accuracy.
May I come in?
- What the fuck?
- I heard the TV, so I came in.
Why the hell do you got the TV on?
There' s no one here.
I don' t want to hurt you.
I just want to know why the TV' s on.
I just came to -- That' s what I want to know.
I' m telling you why I came in.
What do you make of that?
That' s the thing.
This time of the night....
Do you hear what I' m telling you?

It' s not too late.
Look at me.
Look at me.
Where is the girl?
Where is she?
It' s Curtis.
I' m coming in.
Abort.
Stand by.
Await instructions.
She sets the styles.
She brings us smiles.
She' s Betty Coed in college and she' s in the news again.
- Shit.
- She had her hair restyled, cut and dyed.
- We caught up with her stylist...
- Turn it off.... and have reconstructed that new look.
And you 're looking at it.
I 'm out of time.
Keep it locked up.
What about if we had to go off the meter?
I need a man, a man who can unquestioningly follow orders.
The door is closed, sir.
I need to ask you to do something.
I am here to get the girl back, sir.
And there is nothing I will not do...... to get the girl back.
This man...... placed a phone call yesterday...... from the phone bank at Florence to the Copley pay phone.
Here' s the cutoff point.
Here it is.
This man, Tariq Asani, is to be transported tomorrow...... with another convict, a man on death row.
A man on death row...... for their medical procedures.
I' il take you step by step through what we' ve envisioned is gonna happen.
Dispatch acknowledges Florence Unit 5 is Code 7 at Highway 1 5.
You fellas all right?
Hey, help me.
Buck me up, man.
- Hey, I need some help.
Get out.
Me and my brother need some shit right here.
- You marked him paid in full.
- Yeah, that' s what I did.
Hey, give me a cigarette, man.
Wait over there.
I' il be right back.
Yeah, but break me out of this.
Hey, yo, just throw me the keys, and I' il do it.
I gotta do some cleaning first.
Motherfuckers want to hook me up to some injection machine, man.
Motherfuckers want to take my life who just got well here, you know?
Who just got well.
Then the hand of God came down with an outstretched arm and freed my ass.
You know?
Hey, baby, pass me some my way, you know?
Sorry, my man.
Traveling light.
Wait.
Don' t shoot me.
Don' t shoot me.
I can get us out of the country tonight.
Oh, God, please don' t shoot me!
No!
I swear on my mother.
Look at me.
Please.
No.
A seaplane, tonight.
Help me.
Please, believe me.
Now, why in the world would I believe a lying convict like you?
I can get us out.
I swear.
Help me.
Help me, and I will treat you like a brother.
My brother used to beat me.
Nice guess, though.
No, no, hold on!
Wait.
Just make one phone call.
One fucking phone call.
Go into the house and make one phone call.
An aviation company.
Tell them the word I say, and they will say the plane will meet us tonight.
The plane will meet us tonight.
You a fag, my friend?
- No, I' m not.
- Then what are you looking at me for?
I was just thinking how fucking surprised you' re gonna be.
Because, baby, you just did that fucking good turn.
I' m gonna make you rich, fat and happy for the rest of your life.
No, just get me on the plane.
You like girls?
Better question:
Where you been so long, do you like girls?
We have -- You will have...
-... the most beautiful -- - Yeah, beautiful women.
Not women, baby.
Girls.
You got to trust me.
All young.
All blond.
And this all takes place where?
In Dubai.
In Yemen.
When we get to Maskala.
And now, what' s Maskala?
- When we get to Dubai.
- What' s Maskala?
It' s where we clean them up.
We ship them rough...... we make them nice and smooth, and everybody' s happy.
You' re just a philosopher, then, huh?
How about making me happy tonight?
If there' s a girl in the pipeline tonight, you shall have her.
What do you say to that?
I say you' re a stone- cold whoremaster.
Fuck.
I' m bleeding bad, my friend.
-- what you need?
Need some tailoring tools.
I' d get some morphine.
That' d get you back on Happy Street.
Then you get me on that plane tonight.
- Where' s the gauze, ma' am?
- Right behind you.
The helo just went down.
Don' t whisper.
It draws heat.
The helo?
The assault helicopter.
You' il be alone for the first few minutes.
Then....
You' il have no backup at the house.
Well, there you go, then.
You said never go in without an over- watch.
Yeah, that' s fine, pal, but this is the fleet.
You deliver him in the door, you know they' re gonna waste you.
Give me all your magazines.
Give me all your magazines.
Give me your piece.
Okay.
Just this, ma' am.
Fourteen ninety- five.
- Keep the change.
- I want to talk to you.
Give me your ammunition.
Hey, mister, you forgot your change.
It' s a cop!
Stay still.
Call 9- 1 - 1!
Get back!
Call 9- 1 - 1!
No hostage, no hostage.
We' re in recovery.
Our 10 fast ropers....
Kill it.
Get us the fuck out of here.
Move it!
They hit the house.
Girl wasn' t there.
They found some signs.
She may have been there.
So we' re going home to deploy to Dubai.
Pack it up, strap it down.
The girls are taken from the house.
A holding facility, a compound?
It is my understanding, a compound.
- Drugged?
- He said.
"We ship them rough.
We clean them up.
Taken from Maskala to the Royale Hotel in Dubai. "
- All right.
That' s it.
- I' ve got you.
Affirmative.
Affirmative.
No, keep the line open.
How many teams?
What?
Three.
Three teams for Dubai.
Press has the report.
She missed her first class.
- How you doing, chief?
Five by five.
Seven two.
What time is it?
What do you care?
I fucked up.
Hey, you want a...?
You want some more dope?
Want a Dr. Pepper?
I tried to help.
Yeah, well...... that' s usually when people do fuck up.
Listen.
You' re gonna take that fight to bed with you for a long time.
You don' t gotta do it all now.
Where' s the girl?
We gotta get the girl back.
I saw the sign.
What?
I saw the sign.
Then you are truly blessed.
Yep, all set up.
- Yeah.
I got three pallets for the lead plane.
You still carrying that?
Yeah, I suppose I do.
Black, Jacqueline A. 24341 924.
Can you get me on, sir?
Can you get me on?
- I' m just a worker bee.
- Two fellas in green.
Man- to- man, can you get me on the plane?
Why would I want to do that, sergeant?
I mean, if you owed me money or something... -... might want to give you a job.
For her.
Can you get me on the plane?
Thank you, sergeant.
Stand by, number five.
- Keep on top of the tac air navigation.
Guard frequency is 1 727. 9.
All right, gentlemen, may I have your attention for one moment, please.
We' il be going through it on the plane.
The mission is to safely extract the hostage.
To safely extract the hostage.
It is a straightforward extraction.
The hostage will be in transit.
One team will assault the vehicle.
One team will secure the perimeter.
Who' s got the girl?
One team ready to lay supportive fire.
And exfil as per your ops plan.
The rules of engagement are: weapons free.
- Weapons free.
- Go.
We expect slight, I repeat, slight opposition.
Okay, let' s pack it up and put it on the bus.
Sir!
It is confirmed.
The death of Laura Newton.
We have word from the Coast Guard that the bodies have been identified.
Reporting from Harvard Square, this is Jody Snider.
- Can there be any doubt?
- The Secret Service, for obvious reasons...... keep meticulous records, the DNA, the fingerprints.
- Yes.
- And she had just been in the water...... for four hours, apparently.
And she had been sailing with one of her professors, Gerald Sloane.
We are gonna have some video coming in just now.
And we see the body bags being removed from the water.
This is off of Martha 's Vineyard, here.
The divers, the Navy divers in the water, who recovered her body...... and that of Professor Sloane.
As we look at these -- This video, shocking video of....
You might want to eat something.
Real deal is:
The boat went down...... girl and the professor washed up naked.
Coast Guard dresses them up.
Nice knife.
Yeah.
Got it off an East German fella.
He give it to you for a gift?
No.
As I recall, he was...... rather reluctant to part with it.
Yeah, I always knew you Marines were a weepy bunch of motherfuckers.
I got something in my eye. -- tragedy such as this.
Yes, particularly coming right at the start of his reelection campaign.
Hey, Joe, come take a look at this.
- How you been?
- Here you go, Dad.
- Working hard.
- Bet you have.
- Morning.
- Howdy, kiddo.
How you been, Billy?
- Gallon gonna be enough?
- You been looking at my house?
Nope.
Just trying to sell paint.
But now that you mention it....
- John.
- Hey, Mr. Reese.
- How' s life on the road?
- Made some sales, missed some sales.
- Yeah.
- Those new seeds come in?
No, John, they have not.
I beg your pardon.
I know that little plot is your baby.
I' m gonna call them up and make it right.
I want to plant them in the dark of the moon.
- ls it?
Yeah, I suppose it is.
- Yeah.
Took the long way home.
How' d you find me?
Well, didn' t I just draw down on my luck.
- Bobby, I need to talk to you.
- My name ain' t Bobby.
I need to talk to you.
What' s the matter, you got post- traumatic stress disorder?
I hear they say there might be environmental causes.
- Are they going to Dubai?
- How would I know?
- They sending you in?
- We' il leave that to our betters.
- Why don' t you ask them?
- Why would I want to know?
I ain' t a planner, I ain' t a thinker.
I never wanted to be.
You got to set your motherfucker to receive.
Listen to me.
They don' t go through the door, we don' t ask why.
That' s not a cost, it' s benefit.
Because we get to travel light.
They tell me where to go.
- What about --?
You wanted to go through the looking glass.
How was it?
Was it more fun than miniature golf?
- Who frisked the son of a bitch?
- What son of a bitch?
The Secret Service agent, shot himself?
Screwing his girlfriend.
Killed himself in shame.
- Shot himself with a hideout pistol?
- Yeah.
Who frisked the son of a bitch?
You' il have to go half- speed, baby, because I don' t follow you.
- ls there an operation in Dubai, sir?
- Pal...... the girl fell off a boat.
She' s dead.
I' m on leave.
I don' t know nothing about Dubai.
I don' t know what the hell you want with me.
There' s a Army depending on us for the truth.
You can lie to anyone else.
Never lie to a Ranger.
Okay, so that' s you calling me a liar.
Sir, I saw the sign!
- What sign is that?
- At the beach house.
She was there.
She wasn' t there.
She died on a boat.
I saw the sign.
Sir.
You saw the sign?
You were up for a week.
You don' t know what you saw your first time out.
Sir, I know what I saw.
The hardest thing?
You know what it is?
It isn' t going in the door, it' s coming out.
You ever come down off of drugs?
The most powerful drug in the world is adrenaline.
Stand down.
- Look in the bag.
- Stand down!
- Sir, under my mat!
This got caught in my mat at the beach house.
Would you tell me what that is?
The girl is not dead, sir.
Would you show me where you found the earring?
I laid the mat down right here.
What?
The house looked closer that night.
Barometer' s falling.
Low pressure, objects appear farther.
Watch the weather, baby, because it' s going to change.
Yeah.
Will you show me where you saw the sign?
Yeah, hold on.
Hey, it was over here!
Let me speak to the Chinaman.
You tell him, "The only man ever heard him call on Jesus."
Yeah.
New set of clothes from the skin out.
Full set of papers.
I don' t care where, but now.
You gotta get me to the tall corn.
I' il get you the money.
All right.
Two hours.
No.
Wait.
Not two hours.
Something later.
I' il get back to you.
The original building, of course, dates to 1 928.
The center for the treatment of alcoholism, later, of substance abuse...... takes its current name, The Clearings, from the original Johnson farm.
Would you please follow me to the right.
The farm and its 2000 acres were a gift from the Johnsons....
- What could be worse than losing a child?
- Yes.
You' d like to comfort them, but you don' t know how.
I always think it' s best just to --
- What is it?
- Security breach.
Probably a phone threat.
It' s all right.
They' re moving her down to transport now.
It' s okay, I' m with Secret Service.
Guess again.
I' m Secret Service.
And you' il follow my directions, or I' il shoot you dead.
- Yes.
- Step away from the door.
Yes.
I have a message for her.
- I have something to tell her.
- Take two steps to your left.
Yes.
I have a message for Mrs. Newton.
I' m sure you do.
Open your hands.
- Open the box.
- I....
I' m 1 0 minutes from the bomb squad.
If it' s happy birthday, let' s do it now.
Open the box.
They took her protection.
Her father was in town.
They took the Secret Service detail off her to take him tomcatting.
He didn' t come to see her, he came to get laid.
He' s been doing it for years.
He took her protection.
She got snatched.
The girl on the boat, how do you fake the DNA?
- Laura Newton' s alive.
- I don' t know if Laura Newton' s alive.
How do you fake the DNA?
You don' t fake the DNA.
You issue a press release.
- Her father would let her die?
- Did you try to contact him?
- I did, yes.
- And you still don' t get it, do you?
You don' t get it.
These people are savages.
They don' t know how many children they have.
She was snatched while he was cheating on his wife.
So they said, "Let her go."
- Who?
- His handlers.
- What does he know?
- What they tell him.
- What did they tell him?
- That she was dead.
- Why?
- So he' d stop looking for her.
Where are you going?
- I have to get a lot of running room.
Who will get her back?
- What?
- Who will get her back?
- I did my part.
- What part was that?
- They gotta get her back.
- There is no "they."
- I' m just a worker bee -- - She' il die.
- Then go through the mother.
- I' m her mother!
She gave birth to her.
I raised her.
I' m her mother.
She' s just a little girl.
You have to get her back.
I have nobody.
Nobody ever loved her but me.
She' s just a little girl.
It' s been quite a long while since my last confession.
We were getting shelled in the open.
And I confessed that I was frightened.
So I suppose I' m....
I suppose I' m frightened now.
There was a king...... and he had a daughter...... and she was abducted.
He vowed to protect her, you see, but...... while he was indulging himself, shamefully...... she was abducted.
They tried to get her back and failed.
Now, his advisors realized that if the girl returned...... it would reveal the king' s shame to the country.
So they told him that she was dead.
Ain' t nobody here but two people in green.
It goes beyond that.
Nothing goes beyond that.
This girl, they told the king that she was dead...... and everybody grieved.
But she was alive.
Then you better go get her.
We know this house.
Maskala is a suburban villa in Dubai.
Some people operate a halfway house there...... for young women they have coerced or drugged...... into spending their short lives as whores for Arabian tourists.
Of late, the girls have been, in the main, from the former Sov bloc.
Now and again, a North American girl, if she is exceedingly lovely...... blond, usually blond...... will unfortunately find her way to Dubai.
They travel drugged.
They are tidied up and sold.
For some reason, most of them are sold to Yemen.
The girls are generally held in Dubai till the end of the month...... when the merrymakers fly in to examine their purchases and take them home.
- And then?
- That is "and then."
- This is an American girl?
If that were so, why don' t your people go and fetch her?
- Your intel, two men.
Infil, exfil.
- Hardware and comms.
- And comms to what?
I cannot give you.
- You could when you were a Boy Scout.
- I' m not in Scouts anymore.
You heard of the private sector?
That' s where you found me.
Well, then sell me something.
What the fuck are we talking about?
- That' s what it costs?
- That' s what it costs you.
It' s a straight- up snatch.
We got one, two guys take down the car.
Then what are we talking about?
One guy for a day?
Who' s looking for a whore?
This job' s a gimme.
This job' s nothing.
Then why don' t your people go and get her?
- I could hire anybody.
- So go hire them.
You talked to me.
That' s my price.
- What?
As I said, we know this house.
- There are some people in this house...
- Avi.... that if you were to go while you were there...... if you said hello to them for me, I could cut your price.
- What do you think I am?
- I don' t know what you are.
You ain' t a planner.
You' re a shooter.
I think you' re off the reservation.
And I think there are people looking for you.
You call, "Yoke me out."
Then you call for information.
You don' t need information.
You need advice.
You wanna get this girl?
Are you sure she is there?
Are you sure she is alive?
You let me make a call, and I will tell you.
I will see if I can make peace.
If I cannot, I will help you disappear.
Because you heard me call on Jesus.
Let me help you to see if you can go home.
Excuse me.
Fasten your seat belt.
We' re landing soon.
Thank you.
Sir, your container is booked out on Transgeneve.
Flight 562.
1 340, tomorrow.
Good.
Thank you very much.
I appreciate your help.
Mate, can I have a quick word?
I' ve got an outbound at 8: 1 5.
- I' m in a bit of a hurry.
- Just a moment.
- Yes, sir.
Let me see your form.
- Thanks, man, I really appreciate it.
Let me see your form.
- Sir?
Sir?
- Yes, I' il seal you in.
- Sorry to press you.
- No, no.
It' s been a very busy day.
Same wherever you go.
Guess that' s just human nature, but no need to tell you your business.
Your container is all sealed for you.
- Thank you for your patience.
- Thank you.
Have a great day.
Hey, mate.
Hey, mate.
Are you Mr. Brown' s cousin?
No, Mr. Jackson couldn' t come.
- I was expecting you on a later flight.
- How about that?
Yes, this is good work.
Your job tomorrow is put us in, seal us in, walk away.
- And in Geneva?
- Let' s go look at the ground.
About 25, 26 yards from the corner, I want the gasoline.
Tomorrow, the car comes around the corner --
How do we stop the car?
- What do you want the gasoline for?
- Do you speak Arabic?
- Yes, sir.
I want the women here.
At your signal, they go in the street...... start a screaming match.
I shoot the tires out.
The driver comes out.
You cap him.
I get the girl.
- What if he doesn' t come out?
- I got five gallons of gasoline.
I throw a match.
They' re coming out.
When you get me the two women...... pay them half now, half tomorrow.
Then I want you to show me the hive.
We' il lay low till tonight.
Then show me the house where they keep the girl.
All right.
It makes a turn, comes down Abu Baku, where we were today.
My job is the hostage.
Your job is the opposition.
You come in on the driver' s side.
You cap the driver.
The map' s wrong.
This isn' t north.
It' s flipped.
You have to be on the east side.
I need the sun in the driver' s eyes.
I' ve gotta come in on the opposite side.
How did you know that was north?
That' s Cassiopeia.
That' s my girlfriend.
They' re moving the girl.
Looks like it.
- Can' t say I did.
- You wanna prove it?
- Well, the Lord hates a coward.
We' re taking the girl now.
Keep your eyes on me.
We' re gonna fight the girl out.
If I go down, get her to Geneva.
There' s money in it for you.
I' m gonna grab the girl.
You keep them off my back.
You wanna gossip or you wanna shoot somebody?
Stop.
Wait, wait.
Shut your fucking mouth.
- Where am l?
- I' m here to take you home.
You got to keep still.
I' m here to take you home.
Drink it.
- Who are you?
- Drink it.
How are you?
I' m sick.
No, it' s just a formal question.
Cover your head.
- What, you don' t like blondes?
- The whole world likes blondes.
Put it on.
Put it on.
And stay away from the window.
- I need a smoke.
- You can' t smoke it.
What' s it gonna give me, cancer?
Smell of American tobacco carries in the desert air.
That' s why you wanna stay out of the desert.
I could make you give me the smoke.
Keep it together.
Keep your voice down.
We' re gonna get you home.
Fuck it.
I don' t wanna go home.
Nobody there cares about me.
I' m just a whore.
I' m just a little whore.
Yeah, how' d you get like that?
I was raised by wolves.
What are you crying for?
We' re going home.
Did my father send you?
That' s right.
Why?
Why?
He wants me dead.
He sent me.
One man.
"One riot, one Ranger."
You ever heard that?
Leonidas, King of Sparta...... when a neighboring state would plead for military aid, would send one man.
- Well, there you go.
- You ever hear that?
No.
I think we went to different schools.
You ever hear the one about the king who turned his daughter into gold?
Yeah.
He turned his daughter into gold.
America' s sweetheart.
His fucking trick pony.
His election ad.
Fucking cocksuckers.
He took the guards away.
I just wanted to talk to him.
He wouldn' t even come and see me.
He said he would come and see me.
He sent a man.
"Here' s what you tell the press.
Don' t talk.
Don' t tell anybody. "
I told him I was gonna tell.
He had to come and see me.
And he wouldn' t even come and see me.
He sent me.
I don' t wanna go home.
Look, you go home...... some wave their hats, some turn their backs.
It' s all the same.
None of them know where you' ve been.
It' s all the same.
You tough, honey?
I think you' re tough.
I' m cold.
It' il be fine, baby.
You' re gonna take a little flight in here.
- You' re coming with me.
- No, I' ve got to seal you in.
You want a cigarette?
- Can you produce one?
- Believe I can.
Sit down.
You said they couldn' t violate their airspace.
- What?
- They couldn' t violate their airspace.
That' s right.
They couldn' t violate their airspace.
- That' s why you had to come alone.
- That' s why I had to come alone.
But I tell you what...... when this plane touches down...... you will be in the bosom of a company of United States Marines...... all straight up and down and vying for your attention.
What could be better?
Do you have a comb?
I don' t believe I ever carried one.
Thank you.
For what?
For coming for me.
Well, what the hell.
What' s that?
I believe it' s an apple seed.
- Johnny Appleseed.
- Yeah, that' s me.
Just a man of peace.
Get on the phone.
Get to our people.
See if they can seal off --
There she is.
Get her!
Cut him off.
Cut him off!
Laura Newton!
Laura!
The man.
Step away from the girl.
Walk to me, Miss Newton.
Walk to me.
My name is Stoddard.
You' ve seen me in your home...... with Mr. Burch.
You' re almost home.
Walk to me.
This man is a rogue agent.
He came here to take you...... for the ransom.
Even if it was true, you' re coming with me.
- Get up.
- Laura?
This man was sent to harm you.
He knows I' m not leaving here without you.
Give her up.
Give the girl up...... and we can talk.
We have control of the airport.
Let her come forward.
We leave in a minute.
Let me see what' s going on.
- Okay.
- Mr. Scott.
- Robert Scott.
Okay?
We' re gonna go get you on that plane.
You' re gonna make it.
Okay?
Here we go.
- Laura, walk away from him.
He knows the game is up.
He knows it' s over.
You' re safe.
- Get on the plane!
- Bring out the camera.
- I' m getting it!
Get it out!
I' m not leaving until I find out what' s going on.
- Hold on.
We' ve got you.
We' ve got you now.
We' ve got you.
Thank God we found you.
Here you go.
Thank goodness we found you.
Hey, get her out of here!
Clean this mess up.
I' m at the airport.
It appears to be a gunfight.
A gunfight!
No, I don' t know who.
I' m staying to tape it.
Hold the plane!
You know that?
You dumb son of a bitch!
We needed you!
It' s World War ill out there!
World War ill!
Do you read the papers?
And that little whore wanted to bring the man down.
At this time!
- I' m going home?
You bet you are.
And just one more thing.
- I' m getting in the car.
- No, honey, there is no car.
We have to get you out of here.
No.
Who are you?
Me and Mr. Scott came to take you home.
Do you know what we' ve had to do all these years...... to keep her under wraps?
You shortened her life, pal!
We would have let her go to the desert, but you had to put on your thinking cap!
Hold on one minute!
- Go on, what do you see?
- Okay.
- Get on the plane.
Oh, my God.
- Hold the plane!
Laura Newton!
Get her on the plane!
Get her out of here!
- Call the tower!
- Wait!
Wait!
- Laura!
- Get us out of here.
Get her on the plane!
Get this girl on the plane!
Get her on the plane!
Get her on the plane!
Get us out of here!
Get us up!
Oh, baby.
Oh, baby.
Is she safe?
Yeah.
She' s safe.
We brought the girl back.
Yeah.
She just took the long way home.
CSV World News International.
And as we return again...... the administration, forced by this terrible abduction --
- Thank God they had that ability.
- That' s right.
To capitalize on the drowning deaths, to capitalize on the unfortunate deaths...... of those two people sailing.
Here is the arrival of Laura 's father.
Who can forget these images?
- Laura Newton in the United States.
- Yes, indeed.
Many believe that Robert Burch is due not only the thanks...... but the admiration of the entire American people for his role.
Terror takes many forms.
I can conceive of no act of terror greater than the unforgivable...... the ultimate destruction, that of a human soul.
The kidnapping of Laura Newton has revealed to us...... has allowed us to confront and will allow us to eradicate...... the international traffic in souls.
It was brought about because of a family' s love for their daughter.
A simple American act.
The love of Americans for all our daughters...... who are the soul....
Who are the soul of this great country.
- We thank God...
- Time to go home.... this one daughter has returned home.
We vow that we will not rest...
- Lucky man. -... until all who have suffered her fate...... are once again reunited with their families.
Thank you.
