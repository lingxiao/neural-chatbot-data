You were right, Varinia.
Vengeance alone is not enough.
To become liKe your enemy is to lose to him.
But what' s important isn' t our living or our dying but this new thing we' ve created, however briefly.
A world without slaves.
And if you die, who will tell that story?
Live so that I will live.
So that we will live on.
So that it won' t be wasted or forgotten.
Did you see the looK he gave you, Varinia?
I didn' t.
And even if I had, I wouldn' t care.
What sort of looK?
What looK?
- What looK?!
- Varinia!
Hyah!
(Screaming) No!
(Varinia) 'I made a promise once to tell our story.
'It began here in a small village in Gaul where I was born a free woman.
'Then the Romans came and destroyed my world and made me a slave.
'Nothing and no one could stand against the Romans.
'But Rome herself was torn by conflict.
'Bloody civil wars raged for years
'between the plebeians and their rivals, the patricians,
'led by senators liKe Marcus Crassus, the richest man in the world.
'As a child, he had seen his father murdered in the Forum.
'to unlimited wealth and unlimited ambition.
'Ambition Kept in checK only by his rivals, liKe Antonius Agrippa.
'The civil wars were over.
Men smiled at one another in public.
'But the fighting never stopped.'
Fishing for votes?
No, just enjoying our democratic way of life.
A new wine.
From Spain.
But I liKe your cupbearer better.
Any news from Spain?
- A great victory by Pompey.
- Another?
The man is positively boring in his triumphs.
(ChucKles)
(Man) Pompey' s no great warrior.
I heard he' s got so fat on the riches of his triumphs he can barely ride his horse.
Disparage Pompey all you liKe but the man gets the job done.
Victory over vermin- ridden Gaulish peasants is hardly the marK of military distinction.
They say he will be consul.
This grape... (Sniffs).. is not to my satisfaction.
I thinK I' m going to borrow your wife, Cornelius.
(Varinia) 'The wealth of a man liKe Crassus could be seen in gold or silver
'but its true measure was in flesh.
'Thousands of slaves.
'They lived out their short lives in a world of suffering
'at the whim of their masters.
'No Roman citizen gave them a second thought.'
Over there.
Greetings, citizens.
Today we offer a group of barbarians from Gaul, courtesy of the great Pompey.
Ahoy, Batiatus.
What brings you up from Capua?
The same thing as you, I would imagine.
My stocK needs freshening.
Although how a modest man from the country can bid against a senator...
- I might as well go home.
- A modest man from the country?
Yours is widely Known as the finest gladiatorial school in all ltaly.
- You flatter me.
- No, not in the least.
LooK at this beauty.
And a virgin.
A virgin.
Given the appetite of our frontier troops, I rather doubt that.
Being a virgin is overrated.
It' s just an excuse to inflate the price.
(Auctioneer) Good teeth.
And an excellent breeder.
Magnificent.
She' s easy on the eye, I' il grant you, but these Gauls have thin blood.
They rarely last the winter.
It would be throwing money away.
Why, Batiatus, are you in love?
Don' t worry, my friend.
I won' t bid against you.
Oh, you' re too Kind, Senator.
- Though I may need a favor someday.
- Oh...
Of course.
Of course.
500 sesterces!
Done!
How can the Senate choose Pompey over you as the next consul?
It would be a close vote.
I bought you a gift.
It' s beautiful.
- You are too generous.
- Am l?
I suppose I might be.
(Varinia) 'ln the arms of the richest man in Rome
- 'and her husband' s best friend...'
- Show me. '.. Helena might be forgiven her ignorance of the origin of that bracelet, its true cost.
'What is hell?
'Hell is that place where the simplest action becomes painful.
- 'Where it hurts to walK...'
- (Guard) Move it! '.. to breathe, even to thinK.
'The gold mines of Egypt were such a hell.
'Among the Thracian slaves condemned to an early death
'there was one who would shaKe the Roman world.
'His name - Spartacus.'
PicK it up!
PicK it up!
No!
Stop!
(Batiatus) So he' s a Thracian, yes?
He' s an animal.
That' s even better.
This is your lucKy day, Thracian.
What Kind of a place is this?
(ln unison) Hah!
Move!
(Laughs) Fresh meat!
Shut your hole!
Get bacK to worK.
You stinK, animals.
Clean yourselves.
This way.
I want all these chopped into thin slices.
I would not serve this to a dog!
I could get used to this.
I am Gannicus.
This is Spartacus.
David the Jew.
He never talKs.
Some say he can' t.
You' re Thracians?
- The crowd liKes Thracians.
- Be quiet, Nordo.
Eat.
Didn' t get your name, friend.
I don' t want to Know your name or your story.
Why not?
Because I might meet you in the arena, and then I will Kill you.
Why wait?
You' il get plenty of chances to fight.
Save it for when you have no choice.
Eat.
You must be the new Thracians.
I can always tell Thracians.
You stinK liKe pigs.
- You must be Crixus.
- You' ve heard of me.
Who hasn' t?
I' m not surprised you could smell us.
Enough!
To your cells!
Now!
Well, move, slaves!
You, Spartacus.
Where did you learn to fight?
When a Roman asKs you a question, you answer, slave.
Fighting Romans.
Good day to you, Crassus.
Crassus.
What a pleasant surprise.
I had no idea you still partooK of such common pleasures as our public baths.
I do not disdain the public.
You love manKind.
It' s only people you can' t stand.
Now, why is it that those who are most in favor of mob rule stand most to benefit from the public' s greed and stupidity?
Why is it that the rich are always so Keen on reform after they' ve made their fortune and not before?
The republic was a fine form of government when Rome was a backwater city state.
Times have changed.
Rome rules the world now.
And one man with a strong vision must rule Rome.
So power... should be wielded by whom?
The educated?
The wealthy?
The aristocrat?
By Crassus?
Or by Pompey?
Well, Plato did say that leadership must be left to the educated.
That leaves Pompey out.
Julius Caesar, you mean.
You' ve heard what they say about him?
"Every woman' s man and every man' s woman."
But you' re right, Pompey overreaches.
lf he' s not careful, his head will be found hanging in the Forum just liKe that of your father and your brother.
Was it something I said?
This... is the Roman short sword, the gladius, from which you get your names.
Three pounds in weight.
A stabbing weapon for close worK.
You Kill a man with this and you can smell his sweat, taste his breath.
But you sons of whores are not worthy of fighting with the gladius yet.
So you will use these wooden swords while I teach you.
You, slave.
PicK it up.
Come at me.
Again.
Too slow, slave.
PicK it up.
Too slow.
Cinna!
So what do you thinK of our Thracian slaves?
Good, huh?
They have spirit but no real talent.
So you thinK they' re just lucKy?
And Cinna, this boy was very expensive.
Don' t damage my property.
Enough!
Bring her.
Come.
(ChucKles) Come here.
Very good.
Better.
Come.
Let me smell your hair.
Oh...
- You Know...
I can be a very good master.
Oh, yes.
Now, now... now.
- No!
No!
No!
(Batiatus) Hold her!
No!
- (Beating continues, ripping fabric) (Crixus) Hey, Spartacus.
- How' s your nose?
- You got lucKy.
- (Laughs)
- So where did you fight Romans?
- Thrace.
- You?
- Gaul, where I was caught.
Then later in Sicily where slaves rebelled.
- You rebelled?
- Two times.
The Romans, they were terrified of us.
They still are.
(ChucKles) Now they Kill a man just for talKing about it.
Why did it fail?
Fighting Romans is liKe fighting a grist mill.
The stone Keeps on turning.
No matter how many times you attacK it, in the end it grinds you down to dust.
Faster!
Put your bacKs into it, you sons of whores!
Why do Africans use the spear and net?
It amuses the Romans to turn us into fishermen.
I never saw a net until I came here.
Nordo, this man is trouble.
Leave him be.
Draba, they ever pit the Knife against the spear?
The spear always wins.
Enough talKing!
BacK to worK.
Well, move, you scum!
Put your body behind the blow!
Good, Draba!
Push him bacK.
Faster!
Harder!
Are you men or are you women?
Tomorrow some of you have the honor of fighting in the arena in Capua.
Nothing matters but that you fight well and with courage.
Do this and even the defeated may receive mercy.
However, if that is not your fate then the crowd will expect you to meet your death honorably, in the Roman manner, liKe this.
Spartacus... Kneel.
A defeated gladiator may beg for mercy by raising his hand thus.
The death blow is delivered in a single thrust to the necK... here.
That is how a gladiator from the house of Batiatus dies.
What' s the matter, Thracian?
Lost your appetite?
Eat!
DrinK!
- Tomorrow we die.
- I' m not dying tomorrow.
The gods decide when we die.
- I don' t believe in the gods.
- You don' t believe in the gods?
When I looK at the heavens I see only stars.
Blasphemer!
You could be strucK down for that.
No bolt of lightning.
- So what do you believe in?
- Us.
Our will.
We decide when we die and how.
Eat anyway.
You' il need your strength for tonight.
- What happens tonight?
- War, little Thracian.
- (Laughter)
Quiet!
Sit down!
A little wisdom.
A man is no good in the arena if his parts shrivel up.
- He is a man.
- (All) Yeah!
And a man needs a woman.
Quiet, quiet.
I graciously lend you these lovelies.
Use them well.
And in the morning, show me what men you are!
Cinna!
This is yours.
ldiot!
David doesn' t fight tomorrow.
Crixus.
Here.
Batiatus asKs that she be made more pliant.
See to it.
(Guard) Come here, woman!
I' m Spartacus.
What are you called?
Here.
The stones are cold at night.
You sleep there.
I won' t bother you.
- (Thumping) - (Cinna) WaKe up, you sons of whores!
Line up by the doors!
Get a move on down there!
My name is Varinia.
Varinia.
(Guard) Come on, out.
Today you are expected to bring honor to the house of Batiatus.
Fail to do so and you will curse the day you were born.
- Capua.
They fight today.
The Thracian, the one they call Spartacus. ls he any good?
Couldn' t say.
He' s different, though.
How?
All the gladiators here are strong men.
Brave.
But they are still slaves.
They accept it.
Not him.
He will not last long.
You were with him last night?
Yes and no.
You, girl!
Come here!
You will attend me at the games but if you give me any trouble,
I promise that our previous encounter will feel liKe a mother' s caress.
Now, go and get yourself cleaned up.
(Cinna) Line up!
I appreciate your contribution to my games, Batiatus.
Few people understand the financial burden I' m expected to shoulder while on duty in these dreary provinces.
ThanK you.
And I appreciate the loan of your troops.
Security at an establishment liKe mine does not come cheaply either.
One hand washes the other.
Of course.
More wine!
A perfectly ripened pear.
- Although somewhat bruised.
- A problem with discipline.
But we' re worKing on it.
Aren' t we?
Yes, my Lord.
- On the crosses - who are they?
- Arsonists.
They wear the tunica molesta, soaKed in pitch.
Change your mind about the gods?
lf there are gods in this world, they' re not here.
(Crowd) Burn!
Burn!
Burn!
-.. versus Gaius.
- (Cheer)
- (Cheer)
This new gladiator, Spartacus.
ls he really a Thracian or are you still passing off GreeKs?
He' s the real thing, through and through.
- Any good?
- Cinna thinKs the world of him.
- Don' t you, Cinna?
- Very well.
A thousand on Spartacus.
(Man) Let' s see some Killing!
(Crowd) Kill!
Kill!
Kill!
Are you hurt?
I thought in the mines I' d seen man at his worst.
I was wrong.
- A slave has no choice.
- Not me.
The ones who watched, tooK their pleasure in blood and death.
(Cinna) Well, move, slaves!
Faster!
Put your bacK to it!
Can' t you lay with me, Spartacus?
- ls it because Cinna ordered it?
- Because Cinna ordered it.
And because Thracian men and women are to remain chaste until married.
- Slaves don' t marry.
- I would marry you.
Marriage requires a holy man.
I thought you didn' t believe in the gods.
I believe in what I can see, hear and touch.
My tribe believes man was created by the gods.
- That they live in us.
- We' re flesh and blood, that' s all.
That is what an animal is.
The Romans say that we are animals.
That we are without souls.
But you are afraid to say that you agree with the Romans.
I believe that I never met anyone liKe you, Varinia of Gaul... and that I love you.
Will you marry me?
On what, then, would you maKe a vow?
I will be yours until the day I die, and in my life there' il be no other but you, I swear.
On the blood that flows in my veins and the breath I taKe,
- I will be yours...
- Until the...
Until the day I die.
And in the life beyond.
- How do you Know there is a life beyond?
- I have faith.
There will be no other man but you.
I swear.
(Crowd) Kill!
Kill!
Kill!
(Crowd) Spartacus!
Spartacus!
Spartacus!
Master.
We have visitors, Master, from Rome.
And Marcus Crassus.
Marcus Crassus is here, and you left him waiting outside?
Oh!
Noble Crassus.
You do me a great honor, sir.
I am Lentulus Batiatus.
Please, sit.
I and my establishment are here to serve you.
Some wine to wash away the dust, and some honeyed ice, perhaps?
Yes?
- How may I serve you?
- My friends and I would appreciate a private showing of a pair of Thracians.
Excellent choice.
Your Honor is obviously a connoisseur.
- To the death?
That' s an unusual request for a private showing.
I see that' s you' re joKing.
That' s very good.
That' s very amusing.
I am not laughing.
Of course you' re not.
Well, you' ve asKed for Thracians.
That means that you must want good dagger worK.
And I have the best in the world.
But if you want to the death, you won' t see nuance, and you won' t see subtlety.
Certainly won' t see quality.
Madam.
I' m not a butcher, sir, I am an artist.
- Yes.
- I want to give you good fighting.
And to the death.
I want to see courage.
I want to see passion.
And above all, I want to see finality.
But to the death will cost you.
- 25, 000 denarii.
- You could buy an elephant for that.
Done.
And I want no faKery.
No sucKing the sand and pretending that they' re dying.
I want one of your trainers to cut their throats.
And they are to understand that.
Now, I shall leave 10, 000 on account, and the rest when we have been satisfied.
Note the Africans.
Theirs is the finest combat and the most sKillful but it can be a bore.
It can go on and on.
To see fighting at its best you must see Thracians.
- Don' t you agree, slave master?
- Yes, but each Kind has its own virtues.
Change of plan.
Match me a Thracian against a blacK.
With all due respect, my Lord, that is no match.
When a Thracian' s dagger is in the net, he' s finished.
But the Africans are not noted for their strategic thinKing.
Hannibal, of course, being the exception.
I want to see how long a mentally superior but lesser armed man can last.
My Lord, that sort of experimentation maKes for bad blood with the men.
Well, for 25, 000 denarii I thinK you can afford to incur a little bad blood.
(Guard) Begin!
Order!
What is it?
A private fight.
- Who do you want?
- Draba.
(Cinna) Draba!
- (Cinna) David!
Now, he' s a Jew, yes?
Yes, I Know you wanted a Thracian...
This is interesting.
Ever seen a Jew fight?
Exceptional with the dagger and reputed to be very bright, as well.
- Who else?
- Er...
Spartacus... and Polymus.
Polymus... Spartacus.
Spartacus?
How do you liKe them?
All - except that one.
I don' t liKe him.
Forgive me, lady, but that man has been in the ring 12 times.
He' s very good, very strong, very quicK.
- Who will you match him with?
- The African.
- What are you doing?
- Praying.
How do you pray?
I can show you.
Will you do something for me?
Something that we do in our tribe?
Put your mouth on mine and breathe your soul into me, and I' il breathe mine into you.
And then for all time our souls will be one.
One soul in two bodies.
I will come bacK to you.
lf you don' t, I will Kill you myself.
You have to save your strength for tomorrow.
I am full of strength.
What Kind of match is that?
Time.
Time!
What are they thinKing, I wonder?
Gladiators are animals, pure and simple.
lf one thinKs of them as people, one loses all perspective.
ls it true what they say about the Jews?
How they mutilate their boys?
Would you liKe to see?
Bring me the Jew before he fights.
Bring the Jew here.
(Cinna) The rest of you, to the House of Expectation.
Unclothe.
Unclothe.
They do that to their children?
How beastly.
Perhaps that explains their sKill with the Knife.
- I want the Jew to fight first.
- Of course, sir.
- StriKe!
- Kill him!
Kill him!
- Kill him.
- Kill him, Jew!
Why doesn' t he Kill him?
Kill him!
Why didn' t he finish him?
Don' t expect mercy from me out there, Thracian.
Live, Draba.
That' s what life is for.
lf the gods love you... you die in childhood.
That was extraordinary.
lf the second pair is as good as the first, then I shall be well pleased.
StriKe!
(Batiatus) Kill him!
(Crassus) Kill him!
Kill him!
(Helena) Kill him!
(Crassus) StriKe now!
(Helena) Stop him!
Why didn' t he Kill me?
lf he Kills me, he lives.
lf he turns on the Romans, he dies.
He chooses to die.
Who chooses to die?
Who chooses to die?
Maybe rather than live as a beast,
Draba chose to die as a man.
(Child, echoing) Father!
It was just a dream.
No.
I slept until now.
Now I waKe.
(Cinna) Move, you dogs!
March!
I said move!
Move!
Move, you scum!
ls it true that Draba didn' t Kill any of the Romans?
lf a man must throw his life away, he could die better than that.
Will you die any better?
So will we all.
Are you my friend, Crixus?
- (Crixus) Was Draba your friend?
And my teacher.
- Did he teach you how to die?
- He taught me how to live.
I feed you the best food.
I give you women.
And all I expect is your loyalty and obedience.
And what do I get in return?
Treachery.
Cinna, fetch me a blacK man.
Kill him.
Now there will be no more trouble.
The dogs won' t even growl.
Move it, move it, you cows!
(Guard) Move, slaves!
Are we dogs that you snap your whips at us?
Prepare to die!
- Cinna!
What the hell is going on out there?
(Guard) There' s too many!
- (Grunts)
Quiet!
Quiet!
Let him speaK!
Listen to Spartacus!
LiKe you, I' ve been alone my whole life.
We could never looK into each other' s eyes.
Living liKe animals!
Here is the lesson of Draba.
I will be a man.
My life is my brother' s.
Live to fight the Romans!
Smash the gates!
Master!
The gladiators!
They have revolted!
Don' t just stand there liKe a drooling idiot.
Help me!
(Soldier) Field formation!
Go get my litter.
We have to get to Capua.
Go!
(Slave) To victory!
Free men and women, listen to me!
We must get ready.
Nordo, can you open the armory?
- lf I have to breaK the door with my teeth.
- Spartacus, looK.
David, go.
TalK to them.
What do you want me to say?
lnvite our brothers to join us.
- (Cheering)
(David) Freedom for you and your children!
Freedom for you!
Join us!
Spartacus always said that you would speaK some day.
David, Varinia.
- Come.
- You' il tell me later.
There' s one more thing I need to do.
Maecenus!
Maecenus!
Oh, thanK you, thanK you.
You' ve got to stop them.
- Where is that slave scum headed?
- ln the hills to the south of here.
You must save something!
Double time!
March!
Please.
Please.
- Come on.
Let' s go.
- LooK at them.
They' re so arrogant, they' ve lost their formation.
So?
So if attacKed, they' d have to fight, man to man.
And who fights better man to man than gladiators, huh?
Crixus, Nordo...
we have guests.
Should we not greet them?
(Soldier) Retreat!
Apparently there has been an uprising of gladiators in Capua.
The entire garrison has been slain and the slaves have taKen to the hills, where their revolt spreads.
This is what I am talKing about.
This is why we need strong leadership.
I propose that we send the city cohorts to crush this rebellion immediately.
The entire garrison of Rome?
To fight slaves?
How many of these dangerous creatures are there?
Who are they led by?
It is a job for an overseer and a pacK of dogs.
They massacred the entire Capua garrison.
The garrison at Capua...
Forgive my bluntness, but an effete band of pretend soldiers.
A slave rebellion is never a simple affair.
We all remember Sicily.
Twice the slaves attacKed.
The second time, they seized the entire island for over a year!
This particular revolt is taKing place a mere 100 miles from where we now sit and squabble.
Are you suggesting that we recall a legion from the frontier?
- Pompey, perhaps?
- And wait weeKs for him?
Will the slaves wait?
I don' t thinK so.
We must deal with this matter promptly before it gets out of hand.
But the entire city cohorts?
Three full cohorts.
Under whose command?
I realize that it is not customary for a man to put his own name forward.
Then please do not breaK precedent.
I was about to suggest that the cohorts be sent under the able command of Titus Glabrus.
My Lord, I hardly Know what to say.
ThanK you for your confidence in me.
lf it is the will of the Senate and the people of Rome, then I accept.
lf it is indeed the will of the Senate, then, Titus Glabrus, go with our blessings.
Fall upon this rabble with all the weight and majesty of Roman law.
We will march across the world and turn it over, stone by stone!
LooK at them.
They thinK the war is all won.
It hasn' t even started.
How are we going to feed them or clothe them, much less train them to fight the Roman Empire?
By teaching them to share the burden.
LiKe free men.
Why did you propose Glabrus?
He' s as thicK as he is vain.
- Why didn' t you put yourself forward?
Agrippa would have blocKed me out of spite.
Besides, there' s little honor in defeating slaves and terrible shame if one fails.
lf Glabrus succeeds, well, a minor rebellion is put down and he owes me a favor.
lf he fails, the whole city will be panicKed.
And the Senate will embrace a more permanent system of leadership.
Fear isn' t a bad thing, Caius.
It maKes for a more malleable electorate.
Crassus says he wants to be consul in order to restore the former glory of Rome.
But really he wants to transform the consul into a more permanent position.
Emperor.
The day that Crassus becomes consul is the day the Roman republic dies.
The time has come to maKe some decisions.
- We must leave?
- And go where?
- I want to go home.
- Everywhere is the same as here.
Everywhere it is master and slave.
I go where I go.
No man tells Crixus what to do anymore.
Come down, Crixus.
This is Crixus the Gaul.
- (Murmuring, laughter)
But still, he' s only one man.
Can you bend this?
Now all of these.
We are liKe the arrows.
Separately, we' re weaK.
But together, we' re invincible.
And that' s why the Romans worKed so hard to divide us tribe by tribe.
- We' re one tribe, then?
- (All) Yes!
- ls that your will?
- (All) Yes!
(Woman) Who will lead us?
Stand up if you want to lead.
Spartacus.
(All) Spartacus!
Spartacus!
Spartacus!
lf that is your wish.
But so one man doesn' t become a tyrant, we need laws.
- What are they?
- Whatever we taKe we hold together.
No man owns anything but his own weapon.
- We could be rich with the gold we taKe.
- We' il maKe the Romans our slaves!
- I will not be a slave owner!
Slavery is an evil.
An evil that turns all men slaves and slave masters into animals.
There will be equality and justice between man and woman.
- We' re one tribe, then?
- (All) Yes.
- One people?
- (All) Yes!
ls that your will?
It is my will.
(David) It is my will.
It is my will.
(All, murmuring) It is my will.
Then this is what we' il do.
We' il go from plantation to plantation, from house to house, free the slaves, and fight anyone who tries to stop us.
And we' il maKe an end to Rome and build a new world where there' il be no more slaves and no more masters!
- What is going on up there?
- Some plantation is burning the stubble.
There' s too much smoKe for that.
- Then there' s a forest fire or something.
- Tell them to go faster.
- Helena!
- Faster!
Why are you stopping?
What is the meaning of this?
Whoever you are, you are blocKing the path of a citizen of Rome.
Move out of the way.
PicK up your litters!
PicK up your litters!
- (Helena screams)
Glabrus wishes us to Know that while he has not yet encountered the brigands, evidence of their atrocities is everywhere.
"and any Roman unfortunate enough to encounter them
"meets a fate worse than death.
"It is with great regret that I report the murders of numerous nobles," including Cornelius Lucius and his wife Helena. "
Helena and Cornelius Lucius?
- Are you sure?
- That is what it says.
"The rebels' leader is Spartacus, a gladiator from Thrace.
"He has led them to Mount Vesuvius.
"It is there that I intend to trap and dispose of them.
"Rest assured, I am mindful that I carry in my hands
"the glory and majesty that is Rome.
"Titus Glabrus."
- So we' re to be equals, are we?
- Does that trouble you?
Well, I' il do what I can to raise myself but I maKe no promises.
You' d better.
A child needs a father it can looK up to.
- A child?
- (Varinia squeals)
The slave army is climbing the north wall of the mountain, my Lord.
A little less liberal use of the term "army".
- Sorry, my Lord.
- We' il camp here for tonight.
Why don' t we push on, my Lord?
Cut off the slaves before the mountains?
It' s cold, I' m tired and I' m hungry.
We' il camp here.
I liKe it.
It' s light but it' s strong.
Spartacus, we need to talK.
This is a war council.
What' s a woman doing here?
She has every right.
Do women lead you?
ls that why Jews live under the Romans?
What' s the excuse of the Gauls?
David has news for us.
Three cohorts of Roman soldiers are on the road below us.
We' re trapped.
They' re so confident, they haven' t built a stocKade.
1500 men.
I Knew this would happen, Thracian, but you insisted.
"The people are tired.
They need rest. "
Well, the dead rest forever.
You must have Known they would follow us.
How do we get off this mountain?
What' s your plan?
- I don' t have one.
- You don' t have a plan?
From the moment I stood up in the training yard, I' ve only thought of the next move.
- You must have an idea.
- Why must l?
I' m no different from any of you.
That we' re all equal?
- Yes, but...
- So one of you figure it out!
He' il be fine.
- They chose you as their leader.
- I didn' t asK for that.
But you didn' t decline it either.
And why should you?
You' re the only possible choice.
- But now the time to lead has come.
- When I was alone, all I had to lose was my own life.
Now I have the lives of hundreds.
Your life.
Our child' s.
- I have faith that you' il find the answer.
- Where?
- Within the soul you say I have?
- Yes.
You may not have chosen this moment, Spartacus.
But it seems that this moment has chosen you.
My Lord, have you given the troops permission to camp without building fortifications?
The men are tired and I am tired.
When a Roman army bivouacs it is customary to build a fort.
It' s just a handful of rotten slaves facing the same conditions we are.
With women and children and a tenth of our equipment.
A little while ago some of you were asKing me if I had a plan.
And the plan is this.
We will attacK first.
David, hold your men outside the camp until you hear my cry, and then charge in liKe the dogs of hell.
lf these don' t hold, I' il Kill you myself.
We' il all be dead.
Come on.
You can tell us now.
You are safe here.
I was asleep.
'I woKe up to screaming.
'The sound of screaming.
'I was screaming.
'Their men were everywhere, liKe ravenous beasts.
'And their women followed, feeding liKe harpies on the wounded.
'The Killing went on and on.'
Our men began to throw down their weapons and plead for their lives but there was no mercy.
- How is it that you were spared?
- I don' t Know why they chose me, my Lord.
'All I Know is, I was brought before their leader.'
My name is Spartacus.
I have a message for your Senate.
Tell them that we, the slaves, say the Roman way is corrupt and dead.
We want nothing from you.
Leave us alone.
But if you come after us again, we will destroy you all.
I will see her honor restored.
I will not rest... until this Spartacus... hangs, crucified, at the gates of Rome.
You made a mistake back on that island, Bond.
You took something that didn' t belong to you, from a friend of Mr Big' s.
That type of mistake is tough to bounce back from.
- But I' ve only just arrived.
- Today is your lucky day, Jim!
You' re going skydiving!
There' s a helluva view of the lake from 10, 000 feet.
My only regret is I won' t be there to see it.
Let' s go!
- Good morning.
You' re...
- Mrs Bell.
You' re not my instructor.
Where' s Mr Bleeker?
Indisposed.
I' il be giving the lesson.
What' s on for today?
Let' s just wing it, shall we, Mrs Bell?
You' re over- revving.
- Leroy, slow down, for Pete' s sake!
- Do what the man say!
I can' t find the brake!
Close those doors!
Holy shit!
OK, Don.
Don' t worry, I' il take care of it.
Talk to you later.
I' ve got to go and give a lesson.
Same time tomorrow, Mrs Bell?
Yes, Mr Bleeker.
Yes, sir.
I know you just can' t glue the wings back on.
Now, Mr Bleeker, I' m sure there' s no reason for name- calling.
That' s fine.
Don' t forget the double vents.
I appreciate she' s one of your best pupils.
That' s a little frantic.
I' il keep the other three.
Any such suggestion should be put in writing to Washington.
- How is Mrs Bell?
- Intensive care, but she' il pull through.
Yes, sir.
No one' s questioning your patriotism.
I' m sure you' re a veteran, sir.
Felix, find out if there' s a Fillet Of Soul restaurant in town.
We' re way ahead of you.
It' s on Docker Street.
Strutter' s watching it now.
Hell of a send- off.
This way.
- Where' s Strutter?
- He' s gotta be inside somewhere.
Two, gentlemen?
I got a nice booth over here, just against the wall.
Do you think you could find something a little closer to the stage?
- What' s wrong with a booth?
- I once had a nasty turn in a booth.
- Bourbon.
No ice, please.
- Two Sazeracs.
Where' s your sense of adventure?
This is New Orleans.
Relax!
- One of you Felix Leiter?
- Yeah, right here.
- Call for you.
A guy called Strutter.
- Thanks.
For a minute, I thought Harry was laying down on a job.
What happened to my...
- What happened to my friend?
- What happened?
Listen.
Thanks for droppin 'in, baby.
Yeah, you' re one tough pig to nail down.
You' ve been picking at me like some kind of maggot.
First, you go up to Harlem and kill one of the brothers.
And that disturbed me.
And then you go and steal this valuable young lady from my good friend, Dr Kananga.
Now, old Kananga, he believes in all that card crap.
I mean, he' s mad.
Well, possession being nine points of the law,
I would say Kananga is your problem now.
Thank you.
In fact, if I were you, I' d... watch my step from now on.
Yeah, well, you just let me handle our business with the man.
I got my own plans for you, baby.
But first there' s one little question that he wants answers for.
Then you' d better ship me back to the island and let him ask in person.
I' m not in the habit of giving answers to lackeys.
You damn lucky you got an ear left to hear the question with.
Which is... did you mess with that?
That' s between Solitaire and myself... and Kananga.
I' il tell him when I see him.
You won' t see sunlight unless you answer!
I' d no idea you were so frightened of him.
Did you touch her?!
When I see Kananga.
Right.
Quite revealing.
Then there' s Mr Big, distributor and wholesaler through a chain of Fillet Of Soul restaurants.
Wholesale?
Sell heroin, for money?!
My apologies.
I' m sure you simply give it away.
Excellent, Mr Bond.
That' s precisely what I intend to do.
Two tons of it, to be exact.
When entering into a fiercely competitive field, one finds it advisable to give away free samples.
Man or woman, black or white.
I don' t discriminate.
Two tons of heroin with a street value well over a billion dollars nationally distributed free?
That should make a certain group of families rather angry, wouldn' t you say?
Angry?
Why, my dear Mr Bond, it' il positively drive them out of their minds.
- And subsequently out of the business.
- Quite ingenious.
A sort of junkies' welfare system.
Merely until the number of addicts in the country has doubled, shall we say?
Then I will market that acreage you blundered into the other day.
That heroin will be very expensive indeed, leaving myself and the phone company the only two going monopolies in this nation for years to come.
And here I thought it was Solitaire who did the fortune- telling.
Let' s hope for both your sakes she still can.
The question still stands, Mr Bond.
Asked by the gentleman concerned.
Did you touch her?
Well, it' s not the sort of question... a gentleman answers.
Well, having set the example, I don' t expect Miss Solitaire to be any less the lady.
By the way, that' s a particularly handsome watch you' re wearing, Mr Bond.
- May I see it, please?
- You' il forgive me if I don' t get up.
Butterhook!
Tee Hee.
On the first wrong answer from Miss Solitaire, you will snip the little finger of Mr Bond' s right hand.
Starting with the second wrong answer, you will proceed to the more... vital areas.
I want you to listen to me very carefully.
On the back of Mr Bond' s watch the registration number:
6.
Do I speak the truth?
You speak the truth.
Well,... if nothing else, at least I' ve laid your fears to rest.
My compliments on a splendid operation.
There is one thing, however, the...
Whisper.
Take him to the farm.
When do we start back?
Soon, Solitaire.
Soon.
Solitaire, why?
I treated you well.
You lacked for nothing.
I don' t understand what you...
Mr Bond' s watch, my dear.
I gave you every break possible.
You had a 50- 50 chance.
You weren' t even close.
I had no choice.
Please believe me...
The cards!
When the time came, I myself would have given you love.
You knew that.
You knew that!
There' s only one proper way to deal with this.
And one proper time.
The tonnage order is nearly complete.
We move it out tonight.
And I mean tonight!
Mr Bond.
How much do you know about crocodiles, Bond?
I' ve... always tried to keep them at arm' s length myself.
Cute little nippers, ain' t they?
I don' t suppose those potential overnight bags are orphans.
Oh, no!
We have some moms and dads as well.
In fact, quite a few thousand.
I suspect, the highlight of the tour.
Some of these babies live to be 200 years old.
Look over there.
That' s an alligator.
You can always tell by its round nose.
There' s old Albert.
He' s a croc.
Got careless with him some time back, and he took my whole arm off.
Well done, Albert!
They' il eat anything.
Even each other.
Then again, sometime they can go a whole year without eating.
I was rather counting on that.
There are two ways to disable a crocodile, you know.
I... don' t suppose you' d care to share that information with me?
One way is to jam a pencil into the depression hole behind his eyes.
And the other?
The other' s twice as simple.
You just put your hand in his mouth and pull his teeth out.
Fire!
Evans, get him!
Adam, in the car!
Head him off!
Hector, move, damn it!
Bond ripped off one of our boats.
He' s headed for the lrish Bayou.
The man that gets him, stays alive!
Now move, you mothers!
Toby.
I got me a regular Ben Hur down here.
Doin '95, minimum.
- Need any help, JW?
- Hell, no!
You got a set of wheels that just won' t quit, boy!
If they' s yours, that is.
You spin around, boy.
Ten fingers on the fender.
Legs apart.
I' m sure this ain' t exactly your debut at this sort of thing.
You picked the wrong parish to haul ass through, boy.
Nobody cuts and runs on Sheriff JW Pepper.
And that' s him speakin 'that, by the bye!
What the...
JW?
Soon as you nail that offendin 'vehicle, Miss Pearsonjust called.
Seems her dog' s foamin 'all at the mouth.
She' s got him locked up in the shed and wondered ifyou' d like to come over and shoot it for her.
You tell Miss Pearson to take a flyin '...
That look like a boat stuck in the Sheriff' s car there, Eddie?
Boy, where you been all your life?
That there' s one of them new car- boats.
I hereby do commandeer this vehicle and all those persons within.
And that means you, smartass!
Unit 23 in position.
Ten- four, 23.
Come in, 28.
Hey, JW.
Seems like Deke Rogers done got his boat stole offthe river but got a new one in his swimming pool.
- Sheriff, get your boys offmy frequency!
- Give me that!
Now you listen to me, trooper boy!
We got a swamp full of Black Russians drivin 'boats to beat the band down here!
Relax, Sheriff.
We' ve got a roadblock waiting for them at Miller' s Bridge.
We' re just about all set here.
Make that secure there!
D' you hear?
OK, fellas.
Here they come!
All right, out of my way!
I' m in charge here!
You two boys, come on!
I want those two men and their boats apprehended immediately!
Yes, sir, Captain.
I understand.
But, I don' t know where we' re gonna find a boat fast enough to catch 'em.
Call my brother- in- law, Billy Bob.
He' s got the fastest boat on the whole damn river.
Billy Bob' il sure enough fix their ass!
Yeah, call Billy Bob.
There' s two boats, Billy Bob.
They' re movin 'like buttered pigs!
Now, I promised these boys here you' d get 'em.
Don' t let me down.
Cool down, JW.
I' m on my way.
I' d like to borrow this boat, if I may.
Everybody on the river would like to borrow this boat.
Billy Bob, we' ve got 'em spotted.
They' re headed for Hayley' s Landing.
That' s my brother- in- law!
That' s Billy Bob!
He' il get 'em!
Billy Bob' il get 'em!
Hot damn!
If one side of the Pepper family don' t get 'em, the other side will!
Let' s go!
Iet him now speak, or else hereafter...
Headquarters to all units.
Suspects seen proceeding down by Liberty towards Highway 11.
Proceed with caution.
Would you get that chicken coop off the road?!
Did you ever think of gettin 'a driver' s licence, boy?!
Are you sure that was your brother- in- law, Sheriff?
- Felix, what are you doing here?
- We' il get to that later.
Kananga' s in town.
He' s got your girl.
They just took off.
There' s the son of a bitch!
I got him!
What are you?
Some kind of doomsday machine, boy?
Well, we' ve got a cage strong enough to hold an animal like you here!
- Captain, enlighten the sheriff, please.
- Yes, sir.
JW, let me have a word with you.
JW, now this fella' s from London, England.
He' s an Englishman workin 'in cooperation with our boys.
- A sort of secret agent.
- Secret agent?!
On whose side?!
We busted the Fillet of Soul an hour ago.
We came up with nothing but these.
Kananga' s clear.
You should have seen the size of the guy on the boat with him.
Nine feet tall, I swear.
Big top hat, a cockamamie flute in one hand and Solitaire in the other.
The incendiary bombs are set for midnight.
Now, that gives you exactly... 30 minutes.
Watch out for sharks on the way back.
We' il see you for breakfast, Felix.
Good hunting!
You' re going to need these and the shark gun on the way back.
Seems like the party' s started.
My regards to Baron Samedi, man - right between the eyes.
Trouble!
Mr Bond!
There you are!
And Miss Solitaire as well.
Hardly unexpected, but most welcome.
Whisper!
Two more glasses for our guests!
- What shall we drink to, Mr Bond?
- How about an earthquake?
Welcome home.
Where' s our boy?
He' il be along any time now.
I checked behind a rock and his wet suit is gone.
Keep the change.
It is unfortunate your wet suit was found only minutes before the field was destroyed.
Don' t tell me you' re not insured?
The poppy is a very sturdy flower.
You have been a relatively minor nuisance, in fact.
But this gun...
I find it particularly fascinating.
What is it?
A shark gun, naturally.
With compressed gas pellets.
Ingenious!
The air in here is foul enough already.
Somehow I never thought of you as a poor loser.
I was hoping you would join me to drink to the future.
Miss Solitaire used to know all about the future.
Especially predicting death.
An underground monorail.
Connected to the last refuge of a scoundrel, no doubt.
The heroin leaves here, I take it, carried somewhere by that winch.
Correct again, Mr Bond.
What a quick study you are.
Let me show you exactly how it works.
Where in hell can the man be?
Relax!
He must have got tied up somewhere.
These cans hold 25 pounds each.
There are 20 cans to a shipment, packed in watertight metal containers.
It' s your show, but isn' t there a simpler way of drowning someone?
Drown, Mr Bond?
I doubt you' d get the chance to drown.
Perhaps we could try something on an even simpler vein.
On the contrary, Mr Bond,
I think you' il find those wounds quite fatal.
Whisper...
The gate.
Slowly, Whisper, slowly, slowly.
Let our diners assemble.
Look out!
Where' s Kananga?
He always did have an inflated opinion of himself.
Oh, James!
How do we get out of here?
We take the train, of course.
Thanks for everything, Felix.
See you tomorrow night at the 21 Club.
Why do you want to travel this way?
What the hell can the two of you do on the train for 16 hours?
Say goodbye to Felix, darling.
Now, the first thing to learn in playing gin rummy is never take a card from the exposed pile unless you really need it.
Gin.
James!
What are you doing?
Just testing an old adage.
"Unlucky at cards..."
- Do hurry up, James.
- Won' t be a moment, darling.
Lock the door as well on your way up, would you, James?
After all, we wouldn' t want anyone to just walk in on us, would we?
For the first time in my life, I feel like a complete woman.
The slightest touch of your hand...
I was always so afraid that a part of me would stay with the past.
But now I know there' s no chance of that any longer.
To be able to reach out and touch you...
Mr Bond.
It' s good to see you again.
Well, that wasn' t very funny!
Now what are you doing?
Just being disarming, darling.
The Hovitos are near.
The poison is still fresh, three days.
They' re following us.
If they knew we were here, they would' ve killed us already.
This is it.
This is where Forrestal cashed in.
A friend of yours?
A competitor.
He was very, very good.
Señor... nobody' s come out of there alive.
Please...
Señor.
Stop.
Stay out of the light.
Forrestal.
Let us hurry.
There is nothing to fear here.
That' s what scares me.
Stay here.
If you insist, señor.
Give me the whip.
Throw me the idol.
No time to argue.
Throw me the idol, I throw you the whip.
Adios, señor.
Adios, Satipo.
Dr. Jones.
Again we see there is nothing you can possess which I cannot take away.
And you thought I had given up.
This time, it will cost you.
Too bad the Hovitos... don' t know you the way I do, Belloq.
You could warn them, if only you spoke Hovitos.
Start the engines!
Jock, the engines!
There' s a big snake in the plane, jock!
Oh, that' s just my pet snake Reggie!
I hate snakes, jock!
Come on!
Show a little backbone, will ya?
"Neo," meaning "new" and "lithic"... l - t- h...... l - c, meaning "stone."
All right, let' s get back to this site:
Contains a central pas- passage and three chambers, or cysts...
... don' t confuse that with robbing, in which case we mean the removal of the contents of the barrow.
This site also demonstrates...... one of the great dangers of archaeology... not to life and limb, although that does sometimes take place... no, I' m talking about folklore.
In this case, local tradition held that there was golden coffin buried at the site, and this accounts for the holes dug all over the barrow and the generally poor condition of the find.
However, chamber three was undisturbed, and the undisturbed chamber and the grave goods that were found in another, uh... in the area, give us a r... uh...... reason to da... to, uh, to- to date this, uh, find as we have.
Um... any questions, then?
Okay, that' s it for the day, then.
Michaelson, chapters four and five for next time.
And I will be in my office on Thursday, but not Wednesday.
I had it in my hand.
Guess.
Belloq?
I' m sure everything you do for the museum conforms to the international treaty for the protection of antiquities.
It' s beautiful, Marcus.
I got it all figured out.
Marrakech.
I brought some people to see you.
I got these pieces.
They' re good pieces, Marcus.
- Indiana... yes, the museum will buy them, as usual, no questions asked.
They' re worth at least the price of a ticket to Marrakech.
But the people I brought are important, and they' re waiting.
What people?
Seem to know everything.
Well, what do I want to see them for?
What am I, in trouble?
Jones, we' ve heard a great deal about you.
Have you?
Uh, professor of archaeology, expert on the occult, and, uh, how does one say it?
That' s one way of saying it.
You' il be more comfortable.
Yes, you' re a man of many talents.
Now, you studied under professor Ravenswood at the university of Chicago.
You have no idea of his present whereabouts?
Uh... well, just rumors, really.
Somewhere in Asia, I think.
We were friends, but, uh... had a bit of a falling out, I' m afraid.
Dr. Jones, now, you must understand that this is all strictly confidential, eh?
I understand.
Uh... yesterday afternoon, our European sections intercepted a... a German communiqué that was sent from Cairo to Berlin.
looking for all kinds of religious artifacts.
Hitler' s a nut on the subject.
He' s crazy.
And, right now, apparently, there' s some kind of German archaeological dig going on in the desert outside of Cairo.
Now, we' ve got some information here, but we can' t make anything out of it, and maybe you can.
"Tanis development proceeding.
"Acquire headpiece, staff of Ra.
Abner Ravenwood, U. S. "
The Nazis have discovered Tanis.
Just what does that mean to you, uh, Tanis?
Well, it... the city of Tanis is one of the possible resting places of the lost ark.
The lost ark?
The chest the Hebrews used to carry around the ten commandments.
What do you mean, "commandments"?
Yes, the actual ten commandments.
The original stone tablets that Moses brought down out of mount Horeb and smashed, if you believe in that sort of thing.
Any of you guys ever go to Sunday school?
The Hebrews took the broken pieces and put them in the ark.
In Jerusalem.
Until, all of a sudden, whoosh, it' s gone.
Where?
- Shishak.
- Yes.... invaded the city of Jerusalem right about 980 bc, and he may have taken the ark back to the city of Tanis and hidden it in a secret chamber called the well of souls.
Secret chamber?
However, about a year after the pharaoh would return to Egypt, the city of Tanis was consumed by the desert in a sandstorm which lasted a whole year.
Wiped clean by the wrath of god.
Obviously, we' ve come to the right men.
Now you seem to know, uh, all about this Tanis, then.
No, no, not really.
Abner did the first serious work on Tanis.
Collected some of its relics.
It was his obsession, really.
But he never found the city.
Frankly, we' re somewhat suspicious of Mr. Ravenwood.
An American being mentioned so prominently in a secret Nazi cable.
Oh, rubbish.
Ravenswood’ s no Nazi.
Well, obviously, the Nazis are looking for the headpiece to the staff of Ra and they think Abner' s got it.
What exactly is a headpiece to the staff of Ra?
Well, the staff is just a stick...
I don' t know, about this big, nobody really knows for sure how high... and it' s... it' s, uh... it' s capped with an elaborate headpiece... in the shape of the sun, with a crystal in the center.
And what you did was you take the staff to a special room in Tanis... a map room with a miniature of the city all laid out on the floor... and if you put the staff in a certain place, at a certain time of day, the sun shone through here and made a beam that came down on the floor here... and gave you the exact location of the well of the souls.
Where the ark of the covenant was kept, right?
What does this ark look like?
Uh... there' s a picture of it right here.
That' s it.
Good god.
Yes, that' s just what the Hebrews thought.
Uh... now, what' s that supposed to be coming out of there?
Lightning... fire... power of god or something.
Hitler’ s interest in this.
The bible speaks of the ark leveling mountains, and laying waste to entire regions.
An army which carries the ark before it... is invincible.
You did it, didn' t you?
They want you to go for it.
They want you to get a hold of the ark before the Nazis do and they' re prepared to pay handsomely for it.
The museum gets the ark when we' re finished?
Oh, yes.
Oh... the ark of the covenant.
Nothing else has come close.
That thing represents everything we got into archaeology for in the first place.
You know, five years ago, I would' ve gone after it myself.
I' m really rather envious.
I think I know where to start.
Suppose she' il still be with him?
Possibly, but...
Marion’ s the least of your worries right now, believe me, Indy.
Well, I mean that for nearly 3, 000 years, man has been searching for the lost ark.
Not something to be taken lightly.
No one knows its secrets.
It' s like nothing you' ve ever gone after before.
Oh, Marcus.
You sound like my mother.
I don' t believe in magic, a lot of superstitious hocus- pocus.
I' m going after a find of incredible historical significance.
You' re talking about the bogeyman.
Besides, you know what a cautious fellow I am.
Jones.
Hello, Marion.
Indiana Jones.
Always knew, someday, you' d come walking back through my door.
I never doubted that.
Something made it inevitable.
So, what are you doing here in Nepal?
I need one of the pieces your father collected.
I learned to hate you in the last ten years.
I never meant to hurt you.
I was a child.
I was in love.
It was wrong and you knew it!
You knew what you were doing.
Get out!
I did what I did.
You don' t have to be happy about it, but maybe we could help each other out now.
I need one of the pieces your father collected.
Bronze piece, about this size, with a hole in it, off- center, with a crystal.
You know the one I mean?
Yeah.
Where' s Abner?
Where' s Abner?
Abner' s dead.
Marion, I' m sorry.
Do you know what you did to me, to my life?
I can only say I' m sorry so many times.
Well, say it again, anyway.
Abner was sorry for dragging me all over this earth
I' m sorry to still be stuck in this dive.
Everybody' s sorry for something.
It' s a worthless bronze medallion, Marion.
You going to give it to me?
Maybe.
Well, maybe you could find it.
3, 000 bucks.
Well, that will get me back, but not in style.
I can get you another two when we get to the states.
It' s important, Marion.
Trust me.
You know the piece I mean?
Do you know where it is?
Come back tomorrow.
Why?
Because I said so, that' s why.
See you tomorrow, Indiana Jones.
Good evening, fraulein.
The bar' s closed.
We... we are... not thirsty.
The same thing your friend dr.
Surely he told you there would be other interested parties.
Must' ve slipped his mind.
The man is... nefarious.
I hope, for your sake, he has not yet acquired it.
Why, are you willing to offer more?
Oh, almost certainly.
No.
But I know where it is.
Hey, how about a drink for you and your men?
Your fire is dying here.
Why don' t you tell me where the piece is right now?
Listen, herr Mac...
I don' t know what kind of people you' re used to dealing with, but nobody tells me what to do in my place.
let me show you what I am used to.
Take your hands off me!
Take your lousy hands off!
I can be reasonable.
That time is passed.
You don' t need that.
Wait...
I' il tell you everything.
Yes, I know you will.
Let her go.
Whiskey.
Shoot them.
Shoot them both.
My medallion!
Well, Jones, at least you haven' t forgotten how to show a lady a good time!
Boy, you' re something!
Until I get back my $5, 000, you' re going to get more than you bargained for.
I' m your goddamn partner!
Cairo, city of the living.
A paradise on earth.
Why do you forget yourselves?
Where did this animal come from?
Oh... oh, no.
Cute.
What an adorable creature.
Then it shall be welcome in our house.
Oh, well, no, you don' t have to keep it here just because of me.
I knew the Germans would hire you, Sallah.
You' re the best digger in Egypt.
My services are entirely inconsequential to them.
They' ve hired or shanghaied every digger in Cairo.
The excavation is enormous.
They hire only strong backs and they pay pennies for them.
It' s as if the pharaohs had returned.
When did they find the map room?
Three days ago.
They have not one brain among them.
Except one.
He' s a French archaeologist.
What' s his name?
They call him "Bellosh."
Belloq.
The Germans have a great advantage over us.
They are near to discovering the well of souls.
Well, they' re not going to find it without this.
Who can tell us about these markings?
Perhaps a man I know can help us.
Indy... there is something that troubles me.
What is it?
The ark.
If it is there, at Tanis, then it is something that man was not meant to disturb.
Death has always surrounded it.
It is not of this earth.
Do we need the monkey, huh?
I' m surprised at you, Jones... talking that way about our baby.
And your brains.
Oops!
I noticed that.
She' s a smart little thing... smart.
Hey!
She' il be all right.
Have a date.
Okay...
What' s this?
It' s a date.
How come you haven' t found some nice girl to settle down with, raise eight or nine kids, like your friend Sallah?
Who says I haven' t?
Dad had you figured a long time ago.
He said you were a bum.
Oh, he' s being generous.
The most gifted bum he ever trained.
You know, he loved you like a son.
Took a hell of a lot for you to alienate him.
Not much, just you.
Marion, get out of here!
Duck!
Right.
Marion!
Over here, Indy!
Get out of the way!
Move!
Help me!
I' m an American!
Indy!
Indiana Jones!
Help me, Jones!
Marion!
Indy!
Marion...
Jones.
You looking for me?
Belloq.
Good afternoon, dr.
I ought to kill you right now.
Not a very private place for a murder.
They' re not going to interfere in our business.
It was not I who brought the girl into this business.
Please, sit down before you fall down.
We can at least behave like civilized people.
I see your taste in friends remains consistent.
How odd that it should end this way for us, after so many stimulating encounters.
Where shall I find a new adversary so close to my own level?
Try the local sewer.
You and I are very much alike.
Archaeology is our religion, yet we have both fallen from the purer faith.
Our methods have not differed as much as you pretend.
I am a shadowy reflection of you.
It would take only a nudge to make you like me, to push you out of the light.
Now you' re getting nasty.
You know it' s true.
How nice.
It' s worthless.
Ten dollars from a vendor in the street.
I bury it in the sand for a thousand years, it becomes priceless...
like the ark.
Men will kill for it.
Men like you and me.
What about your boss, der Fuehrer?
I thought he was waiting to take possession.
All in good time.
When I am finished with it.
Jones, do you realize what the ark is?
It' s a radio for speaking to god.
And it' s within my reach.
You want to talk to god?
Let' s go see him together.
I' ve got nothing better to do.
Uncle Indy, come back home now!
Next time, Indiana Jones, it' il take more than children to save you.
I thought I would find you there.
Better than the united states marines, eh?
Marion' s dead.
And me!
I' m sorry.
Life goes on, Indy.
There is the proof.
I have much to tell you.
First we will take them home, and then I will take you to the old man.
I can' t figure out how Belloq did it.
Where' d he get a copy of the headpiece?
There are no pictures, no duplicates of it anywhere.
I tell you only what I saw with my own eyes:
A headpiece like that one, except round the edges, which were rougher.
In the center, the Frenchman had embedded a crystal, and... and surrounding the crystal, on one side, there were raised markings, just like that one.
They made their calculations in the map room?
This morning.
Belloq and the boss German, Dietrich.
When they came out of the map room, they gave us a new spot in which to dig, out away from the camp.
The well of the souls, huh?
Come, come, look.
Come, sit down.
What is it?
This is a warning not to disturb the ark of the covenant.
Did Belloq get it off of here?
Yes.
This were the old way, this mean six kadam high.
- Wait!
"And take back one kadam to honor the Hebrew god whose ark this is."
Are you absolutely sure?
Belloq' s staff is too long.
They' re digging in the wrong place.
I am the monarch of the sea
I am the ruler of the...
bad dates.
I told you not to be premature in your communiqué to Berlin.
Archaeology is not an exact science.
It does not deal in time schedules.
He demands constant reports, and he expects progress.
You led me to believe... nothing!
I only said it looked very favorable.
Besides, with the information in our possession, my calculations were correct.
Boy, they' re not kidding, are they?
What time does the sun hit the map room?
Not much time, then.
Where are they digging for the well of the souls?
On that ridge... but the map room' s over there.
Sallah.
Sallah!
Please, my friend, what is the matter?
I fetch the water.
I shall get it for you.
No problem, no problem.
I thought you were dead.
You must have switched baskets.
No.
You have to get me out of here, quick.
They' re gonna be back at any minute.
Cut me loose.
What you know.
What' s wrong?
I know where the ark is, Marion.
The ark' s here?
I' m coming with you, Jones.
Cut me loose!
If I take you out of here now, they' il start combing the place for us.
Jones, you' ve got to get me out of here!
Come on, Jones, are you crazy?!
Marion, I hate to do this, but if you don' t sit still and keep quiet, this whole thing is going to be shot.
Jones, what' s the matter?
That' s it.
Who knows?
Perhaps the ark is still waiting in some antechamber for us to discover.
Perhaps there' s some vital bit of evidence which eludes us.
Perhaps... perhaps the girl can help us.
My feeling exactly.
She was in possession of the original piece for years.
She may know much, if properly motivated.
I tell you, the girl knows nothing.
That is not your reputation.
I have the perfect man for this kind of work.
Arrakis.
Dune.
Wasteland of the Empire...... and the most valuable planet in the universe...... because it is here, and only here, where spice is found.
The spice.
Without it, there is no commerce in the Empire.
There is no civilization.
Arrakis.
Dune.
Home of the spice.
Greatest treasure in the universe.
And he who controls it, controls our destiny.
Father!
This move to Arrakis comes at a delicate moment for House Atreides.
A test of your father' s loyalty to the Emperor.
You must remember, Paul...... our society is a tangled web of competing forces.
Our civilization rests upon a political tripod...... a most unstable of structures.
A deceptive balance of power exists between the Emperor...... the Congress of Royal Houses, and the supposedly impartial Spacing Guild...... with its invulnerable monopoly on interstellar transport.
Complicated by a feudal trading culture that turns its...
Dr. Yueh would be disappointed.
Then he' d know how I feel.
It' s never easy leaving one' s home, Paul.
Think of this as a new adventure, the adventure of a lifetime.
You call this an adventure?
Leaving our home for some dry speck of dust in the middle of nowhere?
You' re a duke' s son.
You have duties, responsibilities.
How could I ever forget?
Every day I have to eat responsibility for breakfast and duty for dinner.
Sarcasm doesn' t become you.
I just want to see my father.
So do I.
The Reverend Mother has arrived.
She wants to see you before we depart for Arrakis.
Why are you afraid of her Mother?
Pitch of your voice gives you away.
She was my teacher at the Bene Gesserit school, now she' s the Emperors truth- sayer.
You haven' t answer my question.
I give you more Bene Gesserit training than a boy ever get.
She wants to see what kind of student you' ve been.
You have given him your face, Jessica.
But the father has given him his eyes.
And his courage.
We shall see.
Come here, boy.
Let me have a better look at you.
If you know what' s good for you, you' il do as I say.
I' il be the judge of what' s good for me.
Your mother has taught you many things, I see.
She tells me you dream.
Your Reverence... -... if I could...
Since when is it permitted to treat the Lady Jessica as a common servant?
She was a common servant.
My servant.
And a good one, too...... until she was 16, and your father took her.
Now, I would like to hear about your dreams.
They' re just dreams.
About what?
Men dying
Which men?
I don' t know.
You lie.... What else?
Sometimes I see strange people worshiping water... and saying a strange name... my name I think.
And worse...
It' s horrible worse.
Millions dying...
Jihad!
Sometimes there' s a girl, a beautiful girl...... but she frightens me, her eyes are strange.
And do you know this girl?
No.
What do you think they mean...... this dreams of yours?
Why don' t you tell me?
Do you know what this is?
It is a test, young Atreides.
A test for what?
Put your hand inside and we' il see.
What' s in it?
Pain.
I hold the Gom Jabbar at your throat, young Atreides.
Keep your hand in the box and live.
Remove it and die.
I must not fear.
Fear is the mind killer.
That' s right, boy.
Pray.
I will face my fear, I will let it pass through me.
And when the fear is gone there will be nothing.
Only I will remain.
No woman child, ever withstood that much pain.
You are a gifted boy, young Atreides...... but you have much to learn.
He survived.
You should' ve warned me.
She was forbidden.
I' m sorry.
Paul!
Paul...
You were supposed to have a daughter.
You have hopelessly complicated matters.
An Atreides daughter could' ve been wed to the Harkonnen heir.
The feud between the houses could have been ended.
My duke wanted a son.
You arrogant girl.
Putting his desires above our interests.
How dare you turn your back on the centuries of our breeding programmes.
I' il pay for my mistakes.
And your son will pay it with you.
We' il do what we can.
He may be worth saving...... but for the father, nothing.
Good thing you don' t play your baliset as badly as you fight, Gurney- man.
Too bad Duncan isn' t here.
- Then I could get a real workout.
- Now you' ve done it.
Whoa, Gurney- man.
Never submit to anger.
Fast on defense, slow on the attack.
You forgot your first principle, Gurney.
Not likely.
Look down, lad.
Perhaps you' d like to sing soprano next time I play.
Guess I' m just not in the mood today.
Not in the mood?
Mood is a thing for cattle and women, young pup.
Mood is not for fighting.
Even with the Weirding ways your mother teaches you.
It' s that old Bene Gesserit witch.
Something she said...... or did.
The navigator is arriving.
We' il be on our way to Arrakis soon.
It is said that they depend on the spice...... and that without it, they can' t navigate.
It is said.
They used to be human, didn' t they?
Until the spice changed them.
I don' t think anyone knows for sure.
I' ve never seen one.
No one has.
It' s forbidden, Paul.
So don' t endanger our shipping privileges trying.
All non- Guild personnel, please secure quarters.
Will Arrakis be as bad as they say, Thufir?
The storms, perhaps.
They can eat the flesh off your bones as you stand.
The only thing that doesn' t fear an Arrakis storm is the giant worm.
It' s not worms I worry about.
Your father is a formidable man, Paul.
Even the Emperor fears him.
I' d sooner cast my fate with him than trust anything...... some Bene Gesserit hag said.
And so it begins.
The trap is set, the prey approaches.
A glorious winter is about to descend on House Atreides and all its heirs.
The centuries of humiliation, visited upon my family...... will finally be avenged.
But Arrakis was mine!
Shut up, Rabban.
I did what you said, Uncle.
I made the people cover.
I crushed that vile planet.
He said squeeze, brother, not crush.
Rabban aspires to rule House Harkonnen one day, Feyd.
And yet he can' t even rule himself.
Explain our plan, Mentat.
The plan is elegant and vicious, dear Baron.
Of course it is.
I designed it.
In order for the Empire to survive, the spice must flow.
But the production has become inconsistent.
In his wisdom, the Emperor decided only one man is honest enough...... and loyal enough to be trusted with restoring the spice production adequately.
Duke Leto Atreides.
Temporarily interrupting 80 years of Harkonnen rule...... and all the profits that go with it.
I said temporarily, you moron.
It doesn' t take long for Duke Leto to believe he has Arrakis...... firmly under control.
And then, at the moment of his greatest confidence...
The traitor strikes.
A traitor?
Who?
That remains my little secret for now.
What about the other great houses?
They' re sure to protest.
Perverting common wisdom, Nephew, is a mark of all great conspiracies.
You see, Nephews, a popular man arouses jealousy...... and Duke Leto is a very popular man.
The other great houses will be glad to get rid of him...... even though they would never admit it.
The spice...
... will flow.
The Emperor will be pleased and House Harkonnen...... will be more powerful than ever.
Alone and vulnerable, at the edge of the universe...... valiant Duke Leto will finally come face to face with fear.
When I' m through, he won' t know who to trust...... not even that Bene Gesserit witch he sleeps with.
They' il all be turning on one another like rats in the flood.
By the time the traitor is fully revealed...... the fate of Atreides will already be sealed.
My son always says you have a feline grace, Duncan.
I didn' t want to startle you, Milord.
The latest emigration reports.
They fear our regime will be as bad as the Harkonnens'.
We' re losing too many.
Spice hunters, drivers, weather scanners, dune men, we' il need.
Should I, er, persuade some to stay?
No.
I have something more important for you to do.
I want you to go into the desert.
The Fremen?
I' m getting reports of hundreds, perhaps thousands, in villages... what they call "Sietches".
In the deep desert.
Beyond the mountains.
The Harkonnen sneered at the desert people.
Hunted them for sport.
- I doubt they' il expect any better from us.
- Then we have to change that.
We' re going to need allies here, Duncan.
I want you to seek out their leader...... this Liet I keep hearing about.
A phantom.
He may not even exist.
He could even be many different men.
Find out.
Negotiate patience so I can demonstrate our good intentions with deeds.
If I' m lucky, they will judge all of us by you.
You honor me, sir.
I am endangering you and I know it...... but you' re the only one I can trust with this.
Such a dusty little garrison town.
A testament of the harsh climate of the place.
What' s he doing?
Water seller, Milady.
You need never bother with the likes of them.
The cistern at the palace holds 50, 000 gallons...... and it' s always kept full.
What' s wrong with their eyes?
Those are Fremen, desert people.
It' s the spice.
By the time a Fremen child is 12 his eyes have turned completely blue.
Guards everywhere.
We didn' t have to live like this on Caladan.
Family apartments are in the west wing.
The furniture is being brought up.
What is this for?
An old custom, I' m told.
Guests ceremoniously splash water on the floor after washing their hands.
They save the squeezings.
Demeaning custom.
Idaho has prepared for us well, Milord.
Duncan?
Where is Duncan?
Can I see him?
I have him occupied on official business for the moment.
You have to be patient.
I' ve assembled the general staff, as you requested.
No, don' t take it up there.
I want the coat of arms to hang here.
The first thing visitors must see, this is House Atreides now.
We are not like the Harkonnen.
You will be treated here with respect.
From now on, we speak the lady' s language at all times.
The Shadout Mapes, Milady, head of household staff.
Mapes, show Milady our apartments.
Make sure she has everything she needs.
I' il join you after the briefing.
This way, Milady.
Come, Paul.
The men are waiting.
Me?
Right now?
It' s time you participate it.
I' ve had the girls sandscrub these walls to within a millimeter of their frames.
The Harkonnen stench is finally gone.
Built by off- worlders many years ago.
A chapel for the memories of what they left behind when they came here.
A thousand people could survive a year on the water...... it takes to keep this place a month.
And a Harkonnen never let us forget it, Milady.
Your name, Shadout, it means well- dipper, doesn' t it?
I was raised in the desert sietches, Noble- born.
Refer to me as Milady, Mapes.
I' m not noble- born.
I am the bound concubine of the duke.
There is no wife?
I' m his only companion, the mother of his son.
You are Bene Gesserit?
Yes, I know the ancient tongues.
I' m trained in the ancient ways.
This place is precious.
It should be protected.
Tell the people, Mapes, this place belongs to them now.
As long as we rule here...... the Atreides family will keep it in trust for them.
Stay there.
Give them back their money.
Go on.
It is a custom, Milady.
This custom stops now.
Do as I said.
Do as I said.
Water will never again be sold at the Atreides' door.
At the end of every meal, any person who calls at this door...... may receive a full cup, free.
Is it possible?
Could it be possible that she brings the Mahdi?
The thing must take its course.
What about the mining accounts?
The Harkonnen spice operation took...... 10 billion solaris out of here every year.
Now, does anyone here still think that the Harkonnen have just packed up and left?
Gurney, I want you to make contact...... with the smugglers operating in the deep desert.
Tell them that we' il ignore what they' re doing from now on...... as long as they make it worth our while.
The Emperor is extremely jealous of his spice profits, Milord.
It' s one thing to turn a blind eye to smugglers, it' s quite another to pocket some of their earnings.
Well, then just tell him what we' re doing.
Bank the entire amount to his name, Shaddam IV.
But then deduct it from our taxes as a legitimate expense.
In other words, cost of doing business.
What?
I would just love to see the Baron' s face when he hears of this.
All the Harkonnen parasites who got rich taking smuggler bribes...... will be flushed into the open.
No more graft.
The Emperor cannot deny this.
Not in public, anyhow.
Well done, lad, well done
Now...
An emperor' s daughter must do better.
Worthy to be your first- born?
They tell me her ambitions tend more to the literary than the political.
Never underestimate the political uses of an awakened mind, Majesty.
Subterfuge and cunning are often better allies than a fierce heart...... and a strong back.
All she lacks is the primacy of our gender.
Then you must marry her well.
Someone with a suitably pliable personality.
Too bad it won' t be that young Atreides.
The most admirable lad, I' m told.
Good union of breeding and training.
We must arrange to send Duke Leto a token of our love.
He must continue to think of us fondly.
Why did we come here, Father?
And don' t just tell me it' s a matter of honor or duty.
There' s more to it, isn' t there?
I' ve never lied to you, Son.
We' ve been entrusted with the most profitable commodity in the universe.
That alone makes us many enemies.
Then why don' t we call them out?
Expose them...... in front of the Emperor.
What if he' s one of them?
This is a hard lesson, Son.
In the world we live in, self- interest governs all.
The Emperor needs us...... for the moment, to administer Arrakis, to make the spice flow.
But he fears us, Paul.
He fears my influence among the great houses.
If he decides it' s in his interests...... that House Atreides should fall, he will do nothing to stop it.
He might even...... invite opportunity to hasten it.
Well then, if you' re right, this place is a trap.
Perhaps.
But knowing there' s a trap is the first step in evading it.
I should' ve taken the House Atreides renegade...... fled to the darkest corners of the universe.
You' re too honorable for that, my love.
No.
I' m too fed up.
This endless feud stops here.
The Harkonnen are a rogue clan, Leto.
No matter how much prestige they try to buy...... they' il never have the respect you' ve earned.
Respect can' t buy us peace.
I' d trade it all for a place somewhere,...... anywhere where we could be alone, where Paul could be safe.
And all I had to think about was your happiness.
Maybe then I could finally make...
Please, don' t talk about things that can' t be.
You belong to your time, I was bred to my destiny.
Even if I were able to go back and choose...... I would change nothing.
One of yours, Turok?
Harkonnen mercenaries.
Save your strength for the desert, Atreides.
Word has already been sent to the palace.
We have people among you.
- Are they trustworthy?
- They are Fremen.
I' il take care of these.
Only half the sandcrawlers are operable...... but we' il have most of the ornithopters working soon.
That is a harvester factory.
We have about 1, 000.
As big as she is, there are worms in the deep desert that could swallow one whole.
Why don' t we use shields?
Shields are useless in the desert.
Even a simple body shield will call every worm within 100 kilometers.
Drives them into a killing frenzy.
The imperial ecologist, Milord, Dr. Kynes.
We prefer the traditional term, planetologist.
I understand that we have you to thank for our stillsuits.
I hope they fit well.
This is basically a high- efficiency filter and heat- exchange system.
The skin layer is porous.
Perspiration passes through heat filaments and salt precipitators.
Water is reclaimed in catchpockets, which you can draw from this tube.
Properly adjusted, water loss is kept under 15 milliliters a day.
That' s hardly measurable.
That' s the point.
You' re a Fremen.
I am accepted in both sietch and village.
But I am in the Emperor' s employ.
You' ve worn a stillsuit before?
This is the first time.
Someone adjusted it for you?
No, it just seemed the right way to put it on, that' s all.
Well then...... the desert awaits.
Maintain 120 degrees southeast, Milord.
Set.
That' s where the sandmaster is concentrating his equipment.
How many men are there on a mining crew?
As few as possible.
Mining is a perilous adventure at best, Milord.
Has anyone ever been lost out this far and survived?
Men have walked out of the nearer zones by crossing the rock areas...... where worms seldom go.
Fremen?
Fremen.
There it is.
That' s the harvester.
And those are the scouts?
Yes.
Watching for worm sign.
Worm sign?
Wherever there is spice, there are worms.
Always?
They defend the spice sands.
Has there been an effort to wipe them out?
Too much area to cover.
Too many worms.
A rich field by the look of the color.
Is that worm sign?
Where' s the carryall to evacuate the harvester?
Worm sign, approximately 40 kilometers.
He' s got you.
Estimated intercept, six minutes.
Do they always cut it this close?
It' s not standard procedure.
The carryall should be here by now.
- How many men on that harvester?
- Usually 23, Milord.
- Are we sure the worm will attack?
- No doubt about it.
Crew on the harvester, this is Duke Leto Atreides.
We' re coming to take you out.
Cease operations and prepare for evacuation.
Spotters, land to the west.
Prepare to be boarded.
Those spotters only carry four men, in addition to the crew Milord.
We can only get another two in here.
Paul, you and Gurney can get to work on the back seats.
We' il jettison them when we land.
I will get in three more.
This is harvester Delta Ajax Niner.
With all due respect Sir, we have almost a full load.
Damn the spice.
We can always get more.
Prepare for evac.
That' s an order!
Worm sighting!
Worm sighting!
10 degrees southwest.
Estimated speed, 40 knots.
We have an approach.
Worm intercept, five minutes.
Worm intercept, four minutes.
Why aren' t they coming out?
They are hoping that the carryall will show up at the last minute.
Sandmaster, this is a direct command from your duke.
Cease operations and evacuate the station immediately...... or I' il cut your ship in two with a lasgun.
I can hear it.
The worm.
I can hear it coming.
Over here!
Over here!
Both of you, over here!
The rest to the spotters!
Run, you sand dogs, run!
Get down and hang onto anything you can.
What are they doing?
Milord, we must go now!
Hurry!
Capacity overload.
We need altitude or it' il suck us down.
Capacity overload.
Capacity exceeds lift capability.
Bless the Maker and his water.
Bless his coming and his going.
May his passage cleanse the world.
May he keep the world for his people.
How about the men we left behind?
- Send a ship to search for them.
- But they were right by the worm...
Send a ship anyway.
When God ordains a man' s time to die...... he directs that man to the proper place.
- What?
- Paul.
I want the pilots from that missing carryall delivered to me personally.
Someone' s going to pay for that waste.
This is my legacy to you, Son.
The greatest wealth in the universe and the never- ending struggle to defend it.
The ancients used to say danger and opportunity were...... often the same thing father.
This is not one of Yueh' s academic exercises, Paul.
On Caladan we ruled by air and sea.
And here we need desert power.
Desert power!
Remember that.
Mahdi, Mahdi.
Leto is growing more popular with every passing week.
He has ruined our system of bribes and patronage.
He' s been able to maintain the spice quota despite our sabotage.
Even that mongrel ecologist Kynes is sending the Emperor favorable reports.
And what do you deduce from all of this, Nephew?
The longer we wait, the harder it will be to dislodge him.
Piter, try again, will you?
Leto' s continued success makes the other great houses nervous, Rabban.
We can hear whispers, petty jealousies that could easily give birth...... to considerable envy.
We have a traitor among them.
I say strike now!
For your approval, Uncle.
The slave is quite a specimen this time, don' t you think, Rabban?
Perhaps Feyd shouldn' t be quite so casual today.
No.
Perhaps my dear brother might even break a sweat today.
What you fail to understand...... is that I want Leto to become popular.
I want him to feel secure.
I want him to feel confident.
Confidence breeds distraction.
And that is when one is most vulnerable.
Such a beautiful boy.
You asked me to inquire about the shouting the other day.
The words they were calling out at your shuttle.
"Mahdi", something like that.
It means messiah.
They have a legend here, a prophecy...... that a leader will come to them from off- world.
A boy.
The only son of a Bene Gesserit.
To guide them to true freedom.
Messiah?
Paul?
These are, uh, simple people, Milord.
They survive on hope.
Tell me about the waters of your homeland, Muad' dib.
I' m sorry, Milord.
Mapes didn' t tell me you were in here.
No wait.
It' s fine.
I was tired.
I fell asleep.
You can go on about your work.
Tell me...... do the cooks use much spice in our food?
The spice is everywhere on Arrakis, Milord.
Everywhere.
Don' t move.
Just do exactly as I say.
It' s a hunter- seeker.
They will kill you...... instantly, if you move.
Listen to me.
The operator, wherever he is...... can only target movement.
Stay perfectly still.
Don' t give in.
Fear is the mind killer.
You' re lucky to be alive.
I was its target?
It goes toward movement, that' s all.
You could have let it go and saved yourself.
There is a traitor among you.
Someone close.
Someone very close.
I want him alive!
Hey, you!
They tried to take the life of my son!
He looks local.
- There' s nothing to identify him.
- Harkonnen, surely.
- And not working alone...
- Stop it, both of you!
Burn him.
Everything except the hands.
Put some spice in each one...... and send them to the Baron on Giedi Prime.
He almost took the life of my son.
Iniative?
You decided to show some initiative.
Success is outside of the bedroom of failure, Uncle.
Hahhahaha, how poetic!
Well then, perhaps you' d be so kind us to define the success.
The boy still lives... but from now on with fear.
He and his father now know how close we can get to them.
Yes!
Now they certainly do.
Your evening spice treatment, Milord.
A- ah, must finish it all.
Health and long life are the gifts of the spice.
Now get out!
Get out, all of you!
Out!
You simple ass.
I told you that I wanted those bastard Atreides to feel secure.
But no, you couldn' t wait.
You had to have your own way.
Now your "initiative" has made them more defensive.
Now what, Piter?
Advancing our timetable would seem appropriate at this point.
Another blinding burst of insight!
How is it that I am blessed with such extraordinary counselors as these?
There is, of course, the slight troop- transport problem.
Our negotiations with the Spacing Guild are not yet concluded.
Damn the Guild and their navigators.
Even the Emperor can' t move without the blessing of the Spacing Guild, dear Baron.
And what would you suggest, my most devious Mentat?
Offer an increase in spice royalties...... payable in advance from Rabban' s own reserves...
You are out of your mind, you...
Get on with it, Piter.
We must try and turn this setback to our advantage.
Perhaps your incompetence will prove useful after all...... and hasten the day House Atreides must fall.
You' re tired, Father.
Yes, I am tired.
The degeneration of the great houses has worn me out.
Our house hasn' t degenerated.
Hasn' t it?
Your assassin didn' t arrive here without help.
But who could you suspect?
I can only suspect.
I can' t prove...... and there' s suspicion enough to go around.
It can' t be Gurney.
He knew your assassin would be more valuable alive.
Gurney' s impulsive, Father.
He doesn' t have that kind of cunning.
Or Yueh' s intelligence.
Surely not Yueh?
His Suk conditioning would drive him mad first.
Never let sentiment cloud your judgment, Son.
There is someone.
Sooner or later you must face whoever it is.
So this is how it works.
They sow the seeds of distrust...... and get us to fear each other.
Learn this lesson well, Son.
If you want to hold Arrakis, you must be prepared to fight fear with fear.
Fear and power.
That' s our cue.
The man in silver is a stillsuit manufacturer in Carthag.
An inferior product to the Fremen' s.
The hard- faced woman next to him runs an escort service in Arsunt.
Impressive client list, I' m told.
By the fireplace, Lingar Bewt, water shipper from the polar region.
The man to his right...
A Spacing Guild representative.
How could I miss him?
The man with Thufir is Esmar Tuek, smuggler, highly successful.
He has fast ships if we need them.
Milady, Milord...... I was honored by the invitation.
You are always welcome here, Dr. Kynes.
We found the missing carryall, Milord, hijacked by Harkonnen agents...... who tried to sell it at a smuggler' s camp.
They are now dead.
We are indebted to you, sir.
Milady will see to it you have everything you need.
It will be my pleasure.
And my honor, Milady.
I understand they lost another harvester to a worm.
If they keep this up, they won' t even be able to have enough money to buy water.
Gentlemen and ladies, Her Royal Majesty, Princess Irulan Corrino.
Your Highness, your attendance is a most welcome delight.
My father sends you his enduring respect and affection, my Lord Duke.
The Emperor wishes everyone to know of the confidence he has in House Atreides.
She brings the Emperor' s Sardaukar killers as her bodyguards.
Water customs here are so fascinating...... don' t you think, Your Highness?
When I arrived, my bathing towels were hurried away almost before I was dry.
To save their squeezings, I assume.
That' s a safe assumption.
Nothing about this place is fascinating.
If it weren' t for the spice, no one would bother about it at all.
Fortunately enough, for a water seller like you, I would guess.
I enjoy watching the flight of birds here on Arrakis.
Many exist without any water at all.
Carrion eaters, you know, blood drinkers.
A curious adaptation, don' t you think?
You mean they are cannibals?
I said they drink blood, not necessarily the blood of their own kind.
It' s said that Fremen drink the blood of their dead.
Isn' t that so, Dr. Kynes?
Not the blood, sir.
All of a man' s water.
A necessity when one lives in the deep desert.
The human body is 70 percent water.
Surely a dead man no longer requires it.
At least here is honest merrymaking.
Careful, lad.
That spice beer can go to your head before you know it.
Play, Gurney.
Let' s you and I at least have some peace.
When the son of my beloved duke orders me to relax...... then, by God, I intend to do so.
Is that how you really feel, Gurney- man...... about my father?
Beloved?
You young pup.
If I didn' t know better, I would take those words for an accusation.
It was a simple question.
Your father rescued me from a Harkonnen slave pit, boy.
He took me into his household, groomed me as his war master.
The man or woman...... that raises a hand against him...... will have it cut off by me, as a prelude to their death.
I' m ashamed of myself doubting you, Gurney- man.
That' s enough, lad.
No more of this.
Gentlemen and ladies, I use the terms loosely of course.
I, the Baron Harkonnen...... have decided that the great seal of our venerable house...... that confused and ugly Chimera, the griffin...... no longer adequately represents the ambition of our appetites.
Therefore and henceforth, in conclusion and furthermore, ergo and et cetera...... our ample and royal self...... from this day forth, and throughout the universe...... we shall no longer be known as House Harkonnen.
We shall be...... House Hog.
Now I know why they say your skill with a knife...... is exceeded only by your mastery of the baliset, Gurney Halleck.
Is it Atreides custom to abandon an honored guest...... without even the courtesy of a lame excuse?
Forgive me, Your Highness.
Careful.
Spice beer can go to your head before you know it.
So I' ve noticed.
You were expecting someone more delicate, perhaps?
Refined was the word I had in mind, actually.
There' s an ancient saying I' ve learned to trust:
Never judge a book by its cover.
We are not all that different, Paul Atreides, you and me.
You don' t know what you' re talking about.
I' ve heard all about the moody Paul...... the grim Paul, the angry and unhappy Paul...... who has been exiled to Arrakis, well, poor boy...... one day he will inherit responsibility for the greatest treasure in the universe.
And a never- ending struggle to defend it.
We both suffer the solitude of our birthright.
Except that tomorrow you will return to the comfort of your palaces on Kaitain.
To the confinement of its perfect gardens and lonely apartments.
To your servants and entourage.
With their slavish flattery and cautious conversation.
As an heir to an Emperor.
Who damns my mother for bearing daughters instead of sons.
You' re mocking me.
No.
I' m trying to interest you.
Are you gonna dance with me or just stand there looking confused?
I didn' t want to come here, you know.
Being an ornament of my father' s diplomacy...... is hardly my idea of a good time.
But you turned out to be more complicated than your reputation.
And I like complicated.
We' ve been looking for you, Your Highness.
So now you' ve found me.
- Have you been hurt?
- Be still, Captain.
The Princess has been under my protection.
Oh, please.
- Gurney, hold.
- Stand down, Captain.
- Gurney.
- I said stand down, Captain!
It' s late, Highness.
The shuttle awaits.
I am not ready to go.
Your father left strict orders.
You see?
Perhaps we should be the adults here.
Set an example for our hot- tempered friends.
You are more interesting than you appear, Paul Atreides.
I hope this won' t be our last encounter.
My father will no doubt reward you for such mindless obedience, Captain.
Muad' dib.
Muad' dib.
Father?
Duncan?
Forgive the abrupt arrival, Milord.
But we' ve taken a force of Harkonnen infiltrators.
The Fremen found them in the cave of the shield mountains.
One of the Fremen, Turok, was badly wounded.
- I rushed him here for treatment...
- But he has died.
This is Stilgar, Milord...... leader of Turok' s tribe.
We' ve heard many things in the desert about Leto Atreides.
I hope what you' ve heard will be the beginning...... of a friendship between us.
My people have suffered long under the rule of such as you.
No, not such as me, nor any of my family.
All that changed when the House Atreides came to Arrakis.
Duncan?
Paul.
Stilgar, this is my son, Paul Atreides.
Yes.
We have heard about him as well.
The Fremen want me to remain with them, Milord.
He fights well.
And he has done his best for our friend.
It will reassure us.
Dual allegiance, Milord, to you and to their tribe.
There is a precedent.
Liet serves two masters.
Let it be known among your people, Stilgar, that Duke Leto Atreides...... honors the sacrifice that your warrior has made on our behalf.
I wish nothing but peace between us.
We thank you for the gift of your body' s water, Stilgar...... and accept it in the spirit with which it was given.
Duncan Idaho...... your water now belongs to us.
The body of our friend, Turok, remains with your duke.
His water now belongs to the Atreides.
That is the bond between us.
Mapes?
Mapes!
Mapes, who did this?
Who?
Traitor.
Who?
Guard dead.
Shields.
The shields.
Gurney!
Yueh?
God forgive me.
I have no choice.
Why?
Why?
Because I need to save my wife.
We haven' t much time.
The Harkonnen will be in the palace soon.
I' m giving you the final revenge, Milord...... for this terrible thing I' ve done to you and your family.
You will have your revenge, Milord, I promise.
Just remember the tooth.
The tooth, Milord.
When you have the Baron face to face...... remember the tooth.
An Emperor' s Sardaukar.
The duke!
Where is the duke?
Not in quarters, sir.
We can' t find the young master either.
Bastards!
He looks sufficiently paralyzed.
My half of the bargain, Baron.
I promised you the duke, there he is.
Well, it' s a delicious sight, Doctor.
Now it' s time for your half.
And believe it or not, I' m a man of my word.
Where is she?
You promised we' d be reunited.
You said you' d free her if I did what you asked.
Well, I' ve done it.
So where is she?
Your wife is free, my good doctor.
Completely free.
Free of her mortal coil.
Free of her physical cage.
I' ve freed her.
I promised you' d be reunited, and I' m a man of my word.
As now you can see.
You think you' ve defeated me.
Never trust a traitor.
Not even one you create.
My noble duke, are you enjoying the show?
I hope so.
I kept you alive so you could witness every precious moment of your betrayal.
What?
Paul.
Oh, the boy.
I don' t know, I' d leave them to the desert, he and that gorgeous woman of yours.
My men left them to explore the beauty of the sands of Arrakis.
Perhaps they' il see some worms.
We couldn' t have all that noble blood all over our hands, could we?
The Emperor was quite insistent about that.
Yes...... your beloved Emperor.
Just goes to show, never get more popular than the boss.
Unless you intend to sack him.
Did I say that?
How impolitic of me.
I must be spending too much time with that idiot nephew of mine, Rabban.
You won' t say anything will you, my dear man?
Perhaps we should get on with it, then.
Get on with it?
This is Kanly, Piter!
Vendetta!
And I am going to savor every minute of it.
My family has hated the Atreides for generations.
They have been the sand in our eyes, the stink at our meals...... these arrogant Atreides, always standing in our way.
I want Leto to appreciate the beauty...... of what I' ve done to him.
I want him to know that I, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen...... am the instrument of his family' s demise...... the extinction of House Atreides...... and the ascendance of House Harkonnen.
The tooth.
What did he say?
Tooth.
What did he say, Piter?
The tooth.
No!
Need you more proof of what heaven' s choice is?
Atreides is dead, and Harkonnen lives!
He' s dead.
Father' s dead.
- What are you doing?
- We won' t survive longer than a few hours in the open.
We have to find shelter.
But Harkonnen patrols.
Worms.
We have to take our chances.
One of ours?
We can' t take the chance.
Could be Harkonnen coming to finish the job.
Hurry!
Harkonnen patrol ships are in the area, approaching fast.
Strap in.
- What is this place?
- A Fremen sietch.
A small one.
There' s a storm coming.
We can stay here until it passes.
Liet, we must talk.
Rest here.
How did you know where to find us?
Dr. Yueh sent a courier.
Said you were being taken to the bled, south of the mountain shield.
Milord...... I' m supposed to give you this.
Harkonnen patrols are in the area.
- They tracked our thopter.
- They called you Liet.
You' re the one, aren' t you?
The one who' s never seen, the one who may not even exist at all.
Their leader.
I prefer the term guide to leader.
Guiding them?
Until Mahdi comes.
Harkonnen thopters approaching.
Milord.
- You' re coming with us?
- No.
- They' il kill you.
- Me?
I' m Dr. Kynes.
I work for the Emperor, you remember?
I' il just say I was your hostage.
Milord, please.
I must remain with the Fremen, Milord, as I promised your father.
Just hold on.
We can' t lose them.
Paul, the storm.
We can' t go into that.
We have no choice.
Nothing survives one of those storms.
Unless they want to die, they won' t follow us in, will they?
I must not fear.
Fear is the mind killer.
I will face my fear, and I will let it pass through me.
When the fear is gone there will be nothing.
Only I will remain.
There is a legend that the night House Atreides lost Arrakis...... a star exploded in the skies above their homeland on Caladan.
But, the saga of Dune was far from over.
Be careful.
You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones.
Only on special occasions.
So, it is true?
You found Nurhachi?
You know I did.
Last night one of your boys tried to get Nurhachi without paying for him.
You have insulted my son.
No, you have insulted me.
I spared his life.
Aren' t you going to introduce us?
This is Willie Scott.
This is Indiana Jones, famous archaeologist.
Well, I thought archaeologists were always funny little men searching for their mommies.
Mummies.
Dr. Jones found Nurhachi for me, and he' s going to deliver him... now.
Say, who is the Nurhac...... hachi?!
Put the gun away, sonny.
Ooh.
Open it.
The diamond, Lao.
The deal was for the diamond.
Ow!
Lao!
He put a hole... he put two holes in my dress from Paris!
Sit down!
Now, you bring me Nurhachi.
My pleasure.
Who on Earth is this Nurhachi?
Here he is.
This Nurhachi' s a real small guy.
Inside are the remains of Nurhachi... first Emperor of Manchu Dynasty.
Welcome home, old boy.
And now, you give me the diamond.
Are you trying to develop a sense of humor, or am I going deaf?
What' s that?
Antidote.
To what?
The poison you just drank, Dr. Jones.
The poison works fast, Dr. Jones.
- Lao.
I find another.
Good service here.
That' s not a waiter.
Wu Han' s an old friend.
Game' s not over, Lao.
Antidote.
Indy...
Don' t worry, Wu Han, I' il get you out of here.
Not this time, Indy.
I followed you on many adventures... but into the great unknown mystery...
Don' t be sad, Dr. Jones.
You will soon be joining him.
Too much to drink, Dr. Jones?
Oh, nuts!
Where' s the diamond?
Stay there!
Come on.
I don' t want to die!
Who are you?
Holy smoke!
Crash landing!
Short Round, step on it.
Hold on to your potatoes.
For crying out loud, there' s a kid driving the car!
Let me have it.
Give me...
Oh, I' m not that kind of girl.
Hey, Dr. Jones, no time for love.
We got company.
Oh, I hope you choke.
No shooting.
Okay, you asked for it.
This is fun!
Here, hold this.
Where' s my gun?
Where' s my gun?!
I burnt my fingers, and I cracked a nail!
Ah, Dr. Jones...
I' m Art Weber.
I spoke with your assistant.
Uh, we' ve managed to secure three seats, but there might be a slight inconvenience as you will be riding on a cargo full of live poultry.
Madam, it' s the best I could do on such short notice.
Heavens, aren' t you Willie Scott, the famous American female vocalist?
Owe you a gin.
Nice try, Lao Che.
Good- bye, Dr. Jones.
So, what are you supposed to be, a lion tamer?
I' m allowing you to tag along, so why don' t you give your mouth a rest?
What do you mean, "tag along"?
Ever since you got into my club, you haven' t been able to take your eyes off me.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, no...
Oh, no!
Mister, mister...
Oh, mister, wake up.
Please, mister...
You call him Dr. Jones, doll!
Okay, Dr. Jones, Dr. Jones.
Oh, wake up, please!
Oh, good.
No.
Oh, boy...
They' ve all gone!
No.
Do you?
Oh, no.
- Oh, my God!
- I' m gonna faint.
Okay.
Uh, okay.
Fuel...
Fuel?
Fuel?!
Shorty!
No more parachutes!
- Come on, give me a hand!
Shorty, get our stuff!
A boat?
We' re crashing!
Grab on, Shorty!
- Lady, I can' t breathe!
Slow it down!
That wasn' t so bad, was it?
Put on the brakes!
I hate the water, and I hate being wet, and I hate you!
Good!
Dr. Jones?
I' m all right, Shorty.
You okay?
Oh, where are we, anyway?
India.
How do you know that?
Oh, I sure hope this means dinner.
God, I' m starving.
Thank you.
I can' t eat this.
They' re starving.
Oh, I' m sorry.
You can have...
Eat it.
I' m not hungry.
You' re insulting them, and you' re embarrassing me.
Eat it.
Eat it.
Eat.
Bad news coming.
I' m a professor.
Yes.
Sajnu will guide you.
On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
Pankot is not on the way to Delhi.
You will go to Pankot Palace.
I thought the palace had been deserted since, uh... the 1850s.
No.
Now there is a new maharaja, and again the palace has the power of the Dark Light.
It is that place kill my people.
What has happened here?
The evil start in Pankot... then like monsoon... it moves darkness... over all country... over all country.
The evil?
What evil?
Bad news.
Shh...
They came from palace... and took Sivalinga... from our village.
Took what?
It' s a stone... a sacred stone from the shrine that protects the village.
It is why Siva brought you here.
We weren' t brought here.
Our plane crashed.
It crashed.
No, no.
We prayed to Siva to help us find the stone.
It was Siva who made you fall from the sky.
So you will go to Pankot Palace to find Sivilinga and bring back to us.
Bring back to us.
Bring back to us.
Dr. Jones, did they make the plane crash to get you here?
No, Shorty, it' s just a ghost story.
Don' t worry about it.
They took the stone from here.
Was the stone very smooth like a rock from a sacred river?
That' s right.
But why would Maharaja take the sacred stone from here?
They says we must pray to their evil god.
We says we will not.
I don' t understand how one rock could destroy a whole village.
He' s saying when the sacred stone was taken, the village wells dried up, and the river turned to sand.
The crops were swallowed by the earth, and the animals laid down and turned to dust.
Then one night there was a fire in the fields.
The men went out to fight the fire.
When they came back, the women were crying in the darkness.
Children.
He says they stole their children.
Sankara!
Sankara...
Sankara.
Little boy escaped from the evil palace.
Many other children still there.
What we do, Dr. Jones?
What you think?
I think that somebody believes the good luck rock from this village is one of the lost Sankara stones.
What is Sankara?
Fortune and glory, kid.
Fortune and glory.
Willie, quit monkeying around on that thing.
Oh, wait a second!
I can' t go to Delhi like this!
We' re not going to Delhi, doll.
We' re going to Pankot Palace.
Pankot?!
I' m a singer.
Oh, I need to call my agent.
Anybody, I need a phone!
Oh, quit complaining.
This is expensive stuff.
You come to America with me, and we get job in circus.
You like America?
You' re my best friend.
Ooh, what big birds!
Those aren' t big birds, sweetheart.
They' re giant vampire bats.
Bats?
This doesn' t hurt.
You know what you really need?
You really need a bath.
Ha- ha, very funny.
Very funny.
All wet.
I was happy in Shanghai.
I had a little house... and a garden.
My friends were rich.
We went to parties all the time in limousines.
I hate being outside!
I' m a singer!
I could lose my voice!
I think we' il camp here tonight.
Cut it out.
What do you got?
Aha- ha, three aces.
I win.
Ha, ha, ha!
It' s poker, Shorty, anything can happen.
Where did you find your, uh, little bodyguard?
What?
He' s been living on the streets since he was four.
I caught him trying to pick my pocket, didn' t I, short stuff?
Biggest trouble with her is the noise.
You cheat, Dr. Jones.
You cheat!
You take four card.
- Oh, they were stuck together.
They were stuck together.
You cheat very big.
Dr. Jones, you cheat!
You owe me ten cent.
Look at this.
You' re cheating.
You make me poor.
Play with you no fun.
- I quit.
Oh, this place is completely surrounded.
The entire place is crawling with living things.
That' s why they call it the jungle, sweetheart.
Oh, my God, what else is out there?
Oh!
Willie, Willie...
Is that short for something?
"Willie" is my professional name, Indiana.
Hey, lady, you call him Dr. Jones.
My professional name.
Why are you dragging us off to this deserted palace?
Fortune and glory.
Well... this is a piece of an old manuscript.
This pictograph represents Sankara, a priest.
Scram.
This is hundreds of years old.
Is that some kind of writing?
Cut it out.
It' s part of the legend of Sankara.
He climbs Mount Kalisa where he meets Siva, the Hindu god.
And what' s he handing the priest?
Rocks.
Stop.
And to help him, he gave him five sacred stones with magical properties.
My grandpa was a magician.
He spent his entire life with a rabbit in his pocket and pigeons up his sleeves.
He made a lot of children happy and died a very poor man.
Magic rocks.
Fortune and glory.
Sweet dreams, Dr. Jones.
Where are you going?
I' d sleep closer, if I were you.
For safety' s sake.
Dr. Jones, I' d be safer sleeping with a snake.
I said, cut it out!
I hate that elephant.
Indy, look!
I see it, Shorty.
Pankot Palace.
Don' t come up here.
Oh, no!
They' re stealing our rides!
We walk from here.
Hello.
I should say you look rather lost.
But then I cannot imagine where in the world the three of you would look at home.
We' re on our way to Delhi.
This is Miss Scott.
This is Mr. Round.
Short Round.
My name is Indiana Jones.
Dr. Jones, the eminent archaeologist?
Hard to believe, isn' t it?
Oh.
I' m Chattar Lal, Prime Minister to His Highness, the Maharaja of Pankot.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Welcome to Pankot Palace!
Enchanted, huh?
Shorty, where' s my razor?
We are fortunate tonight to have so many unexpected visitors.
This is Captain...... Blumburtt.
11th Poona Rifles.
I am, Captain.
Captain Blumburtt and his troops are on a routine inspection tour.
The British find it amusing to inspect us at their convenience.
I do hope, sir, that it' s not, uh, inconvenient to you, uh... sir.
The British worry so about their empire.
Makes us all feel like well- cared- for children.
Ah... you look beautiful.
I think the maharaja is swimming in loot.
Maybe it wasn' t such a bad idea coming here after all.
You look like a princess.
Mr. Lal, what do they call the maharaja' s wife?
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
How interesting.
Well, uh, maybe it' s because he hasn' t found the right woman.
His Supreme Highness, guardian of Pankot tradition, the Maharaja of Pankot,
That' s the maharaja?
A kid?!
Maybe he like older women.
Captain Blumburtt was just telling me something of the interesting history of the palace... the importance it played in the mutiny.
It seems the British never forget the Mutiny of 1857.
Yes, well, you know, I think there are other events... before the mutiny, going back a century, back to the time of Clive... that are more interesting.
And what events are those, Dr. Jones?
Well, if memory serves me correctly, this area, this province, was the center of activity for the Thuggee.
Snake...
What' s the surprise?
Dr. Jones, you know perfectly well the Thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century.
The Thuggee was an obscenity that worshipped Kali with human sacrifices.
The British Army nicely did away with them.
Well, I suppose stories of the Thuggee die hard.
There are no stories anymore.
I' m not so sure.
We came from a small village.
Pankot Palace was growing powerful again because of some ancient evil.
Village stories, Dr. Jones.
They' re just fear and folklore.
You' re beginning to worry Captain Blumburtt.
I' m not worried, Mr. Prime Minister, just, uh... just, um, interested.
What?
You are not eating?
I had bugs for lunch.
Give me your hat.
Why?
Oh!
Pankot Palace had taken something.
Dr. Jones, in our country, it' s not usual for a guest to insult his host.
I thought we were talking about folklore.
Excuse me, sir, do you have anything simple, like soup?
What exactly was it they say was stolen?
A sacred rock.
You see, Captain, a rock!
Something connected... the villagers' rock and the old legend of the Sankara Stones.
Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors.
I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than an archaeologist.
Well, the newspapers greatly exaggerated the incident.
And wasn' t it the Sultan of Madagascar who threatened to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
No, it wasn' t my head.
Then your hands, perhaps.
No, it wasn' t my hands, it was my... my misunderstanding.
Exactly what we have here, Dr. Jones.
I have heard the evil stories of the Thuggee cult.
I thought the stories were told to frighten children.
Later, I learnt the Thuggee cult was once real and did of unspeakable things.
I am ashamed of what happened here so many years ago, and I assure you this will never happen again in my kingdom.
If I offended you... then I am sorry.
Ah, dessert!
Chilled monkey brains.
Uh, I think I' il just check on Willie.
That' s all you better do.
Tell me later what happened.
Am- scray.
I' ve got something for you.
There' s nothing you have that I could possibly want.
Right.
Oh, you' re a very nice man.
Maybe you could be my palace slave.
Yeah.
And nothing else.
Nothing shocks me.
I' m a scientist.
So, as a scientist, you do a lot of research?
Always.
Nocturnal activities.
You mean like what sort of cream I put on my face at night, what position I like to sleep in?
Mating customs.
Love rituals?
Primitive sexual practices.
Years of fieldwork.
Oh.
I don' t blame you for being sore at me.
I can be hard to handle.
I' ve had worse.
But you' il never have better.
I don' t know.
I' il let you know in the morning.
Why, you conceited ape.
I' m not that easy.
I' m not that easy, either.
Trouble with you is, Willie, you' re too used to getting your own way.
And you' re just too proud to admit that you' re crazy about me, Dr. Jones.
If you want me, Willie, you know where you can find me.
You' il be back over here in five minutes.
Five.
You know it, and I know it.
Five minutes.
Four and a half.
"Palace slave."
"Nocturnal activities."
I' m a "conceited ape"?
"I' il tell you in the morning."
I can' t believe it.
He' s not coming.
She' s not coming.
I can' t believe I' m not going.
This is one night you' il never forget!
I slipped right through your fingers!
Sleep tight... and pleasant dreams!
I could have been your greatest adventure.
Dr. Jones, your whip!
Turn off the switch.
Oh, Indy.
Oh, be gentle with me.
But I' m here.
There' s nobody here.
No, I' m here.
Indy, you' re acting awfully strange.
Hey, I' m right here.
"Follow in the footsteps of Siva."
What does that mean?
"Do not betray these truths."
Shorty, go get our stuff.
Stay behind me, Short Round.
Step where I step, and don' t touch anything.
I step where you step.
I touch nothing.
Indy!
I step on something.
Yeah, there' s something on the ground.
Feel like step on fortune cookies.
It' s not fortune cookies.
Let me take a look.
It' s all right.
I got him.
There, go.
Stop.
Look, just stand up against the wall, will you?
I listen to what you say!
Willie, get down here!
We' re in trouble!
Willie!
Bet I get all dirty again.
We' re in trouble!
Trouble?
What sort of...?
This is serious!
There are two dead people down here!
There' re going to be two dead people in here!
I' ve almost had enough of you two.
Willie!
What' s the rush?!
It' s a long story, Willie.
Hurry, or you don' t get to hear it.
Ooh, God, what is this?
Indy, what is this?
I can' t see a thing!
Hurry!
Oh, I broke a nail.
Willie, hurry!
They' re in my hair!
No, let us out!
Let us out!
I' m down here!
They' re all over me!
There' s got to be a fulcrum release lever somewhere.
A handle that opens the door.
- They' re just, just square holes!
Hurry, Willie!
The other one!
The other right.
The one on your right!
Oh, there' s slime inside!
I can' t do it.
You can do it.
Okay.
You feel inside!
Do it now!
Okay!
Willie, we are going to die!
It' s soft.
It' s moving!
Got it!
Get 'em off of me!
Get 'em off me!
It' s her!
Huh?!
Come on!
Come on, move!
Come on!
- What?
You' re going the wrong way.
We have to get to Berlin.
Brody' s this way.
My diary' s in Berlin.
Marcus has the map.
There is more in the diary than just the map.
All right, dad.
What final challenge?
Booby traps?
Oh, yes.
But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the chronicles of St. Anselm.
Well, what are they?
Can' t you remember?
I wrote them down in my diary so that I wouldn' t have to remember.
Into the lion' s den?
The only thing that matters is the grail.
Marcus would agree with me.
Jesus Christ.
That' s for blasphemy.
The quest for the grail is not archaeology.
It' s a race against evil.
If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth.
Do you understand me?
I never understood it.
Never.
Neither did mom.
Only too well.
Unfortunately, she kept her illness from me until all I could do was mourn her.
My boy, we are pilgrims in an unholy land.
Fraulein doctor.
How did you get here?
I want it.
You came back for the book?
My father didn' t want it incinerated.
I believe in the grail, not the swastika.
But you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything that the grail stands for.
You do.
All I have to do is squeeze.
All I have to do is scream.
Let' s get the hell out of here.
I don' t know.
Good.
Well, we made it.
When we' re airborne, with Germany behind us, then I' il share that sentiment.
Relax.
Tickets, please.
Guten tag... herr Jones.
Tickets, please.
No ticket.
You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.
It' s disgraceful.
You' re old enough to be her fa... her- her grandfather.
I was the next man.
Oh.
Well... ships that pass in the night.
Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink, hmm?
Hmm?
What did we talk about?
We didn' t talk.
We never talked.
Do I detect a rebuke?
It was just the two of us, dad.
It was a lonely way to grow up.
For you, too.
like the other guys' dads, you' d have understood that.
Actually, I was a wonderful father.
When?
Wash your ears?
I respected your privacy, and I taught you self- reliance.
What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who' d been dead for 500 years in another country.
And I learned it so well that we' ve hardly spoken for 20 years.
Unbelievable.
Very well.
What do you want to talk about?
I can' t think of anything.
Then what are you complaining about?
Look, we have work to do.
The first,
"the breath of god.
Only the penitent man will pass. "
"the word of god.
Only in the footsteps of god will he proceed. "
"the path of god.
"Only in the leap from the lion' s head will he prove his worth."
What does that mean?
I don' t know.
We' il find out.
We' re turning around.
They' re taking us back to Germany.
Come on, dad.
Move!
Come on!
I didn' t know you could fly a plane.
Fly, yes.
Land, no.
Get it ready.
Eleven o' clock!
Dad, eleven o' clock!
What happens at eleven o' clock?
Twelve, eleven, ten.
Eleven o' clock, fire!
Dad, are we hit?!
More or less.
They got us.
Hang on, dad.
We' re going in!
Nice landing.
Thanks.
I know, dad!
Well.
It' s a new experience for me.
It happens to me all the time.
This is intolerable!
This could be close.
Faster!
Well, they don' t come any closer than that!
Dad, he' s coming back!
I suddenly remembered my Charlemagne.
"Let my armies be the rocks and the trees and the birds in the sky."
These pages are taken from professor Jones' diary, your highness, and they include a map that pinpoints the exact location of the grail.
As you can see, the grail is all but in our hands.
However, your highness, we would not think of crossing your soil without your permission, nor of removing the grail from your borders without suitable compensation.
What have you brought?
Precious valuables, your highness, donated by some of the finest families in all of Germany.
Rolls- Royce phantom two.
Four- point- three liter, 30 horsepower, six- cylinder engine, with Stromberg downdraft carburetor.
Can go from zero to 100 kilometers an hour in 12. 5 seconds.
And I even like the color.
The keys are in the ignition, your highness.
You shall have camels, horses, an armed escort, provisions, desert vehicles and tanks.
Indiana Jones and his father have escaped.
We go this way.
Get that camel out of the way.
What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
I believe they took Mr. Brody with them.
Now they have the map.
And in this sort of race, there' s no silver medal for finishing second.
Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?
I' d rather spit in your face.
But as I haven' t got any spit... must be within three or four miles.
Otherwise we are off the map.
Well, Marcus, we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind.
You' re meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend.
Ah, I see Brody.
He seems okay.
They' ve got a tank.
Six- pound gun.
Get down!
Dad, we' re well out of range.
Come on, come on!
Maybe it wasn' t even Jones.
He' s here somewhere.
Put Brody in the tank.
Well, in this sun, without transportation, they' re as good as dead.
It' s Jones, all right.
Now, who are all these people?
Who cares?
As long as they' re keeping Donovan busy.
Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation.
I' il take the camels.
But, Indy... no camels.
Who is he?
A messenger from god.
For the unrighteous, the cup of life holds everlasting damnation.
Oh.
"Genius of the restoration..." "aid our own resuscitation."
Henry, what are you doing here?
Come on.
Search him.
That miserable little diary of yours.
And yet you come all the way back to Berlin to get it.
Why?
What are you hiding?
What does the diary tell you that it doesn' t tell us?
It tells me that goose- stepping morons like yourself should try reading books instead of burning them.
Jones is getting away.
I think not, herr Donovan.
Not that Jones, the other Jones!
Sallah, I said no camels!
Can' t you count?
Compensation for my brother- in- law' s car.
Indy, your father and Brody... where' s my father?
In the belly of that steel beast.
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Junior?!
Dad!
Get out!
- what?
The pen is mightier than the sword.
Look what you did.
It' s war.
Didn' t I tell you it was a rescue, huh?
Yeah?
Get out of there, dad.
How does one get off this thing?
Where' s Marcus?
Hang on, dad!
Father of Indy, give me your hand!
Get dad!
Give me your hand!
Junior!
Indy!
Oh, god.
I' ve lost him.
And I never told him anything.
I just wasn' t ready, Marcus.
Five minutes would have been enough.
I thought I' d lost you, boy!
I thought you had too, sir.
Come on.
Let' s go, then.
Why are you sitting there resting when we' re so near the end?!
Come on, let' s go!
The canyon of the crescent moon.
Helmut, another volunteer!
I never expected to see you again.
I' m like a bad penny; I always turn up.
Give dr.
He' s going to recover the grail for us.
Ready to go down in history?
The Nazis?!
Is that the limit of your vision?
The Nazis want to write themselves into the grail legend... take on the world.
Well, they' re welcome.
The cup that gives everlasting life.
Hitler can have the world, but he can' t take it with him.
I' m going to be drinking my own health when he' s gone the way of the dodo.
The grail is mine... and you' re going to get it for me.
You know something, dr.
You' re absolutely right.
Dad?
- no!
- Get back!
You can' t save him when you' re dead!
The healing power of the grail is the only thing that can save your father now.
It' s time to ask yourself what you believe.
"The breath of god...... only the penitent man will pass."
"The penitent man will pass.
The penitent man will pass.
The penitent man... "only the penitent man will pass."
"Only the penitent man will pass."
The penitent man will pass.
The penitent, penitent... the penitent man... the penitent man... the penitent... the penitent man is humble before god.
Penitent.
Penitent... the penitent man... penitent man is humble...... kneels before god.
Kneel!
I' m through!
We' re through.
No.
The second challenge:
"Only in the footsteps of god will he proceed."
The word of god... the word of...
proceed in the footsteps of the word.
"The word of god..." no, Henry.
Try not to talk.
The name of god... the name of god...
Jehovah.
But in the Latin alphabet, Jehovah begins with an "I."
J...
In Latin, Jehovah starts with an "I."
"h"...
"the path of god."
"Only in the leap from the lion' s head will he prove his worth."
Impossible... nobody can jump this.
Indy, you must hurry!
Come quickly!
It' s a leap of faith.
You must... believe.
I knew you' d come, but my strength has left me.
Who are you?
The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the grail and to guard it.
That was 700 years ago.
A long time to wait.
You' re strangely dressed... for a knight.
I' m not exactly... a knight.
I was chosen because I was the bravest, the most worthy.
The honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat.
I pass it... to you who vanquished me.
Listen, I don' t have time to explain, but...
which one is it?
You must choose, but choose wisely.
For as the true grail will bring you life, the false grail will take it from you.
I' m not a historian.
I have no idea what it looks like.
Let me choose.
Thank you, doctor.
Oh, yes.
It' s more beautiful than I' d ever imagined.
This certainly is the cup of the king of kings.
Eternal life.
What is happening to me?
He chose... poorly.
It would not be made out of goid.
That' s the cup of a carpenter.
There' s only one way to find out.
You have chosen wisely.
But the grail cannot pass beyond the great seal.
That is the boundary and the price of immortality.
Drop your guns.
Dad, come on, get to your feet.
We have got it.
Come on!
Elsa!
It' s ours, Indy... yours and mine.
The knight warned us not to take the grail from here.
Junior!
Elsa, don' t.
Elsa... give me your other hand, honey.
I can reach it.
Give me your other hand!
I can' t hold on.
I can almost reach it, dad.
Indiana...
let it go.
Dad...
please, dad.
Elsa never really believed in the grail.
She thought she' d found a prize.
What did you find, dad?
Me?
Illumination.
And what did you find, junior?
"Junior"?
Dad... please, what does it always mean, this... this "junior"?
We named the dog Indiana.
May we go home now, please?
You are named after the dog?
I' ve got a lot of fond memories of that dog.
Ready?
Ready.
Follow me.
Got lost in his own museum, huh?
After you, junior.
Ha!
Not bad.
But not good enough to live.
Mind if I sit down?
I don' t have your energy.
Fight with your head.
Not your heart.
Straight.
Better, Einon.
But you' re still dead.
Purpose, not passion.
No one ever found victory in the dirt.
The peasants are revolting.
They' ve always been revoltin ', Prince.
But now they' re rebellin '.
King Freyne wants his son to witness his noble victory.
There' s nothing noble about crushing desperate men.
They' re traitorous scum!
The king commands!
Bring him!
You can come, too, nursemaid.
Die, you dog!
- I wish we were down there.
- No, you don' t.
Yes, I do.
Just to see you in action, Bowen.
Yours would be the finest blade on the field.
My blade was not made for your father' s slaughter.
He is my father, Bowen, and he is the king.
Yes.
But when you are king, remember today... and the difference between battle and butchery.
And remember the Old Code.
Then you' il be a greater king than your father.
I promise, Knight...
I will be greater.
Freyne!
Now, Hewe, now!
- He' s trapped!
- Einon!
Einon!
Einon, no!
Enough!
Enough!
The battle' s out there!
Father?
Die!
It' s mine!
Einon!
Einon!
I' m here, Einon!
I' m here, my King.
Dead, madam.
King Freyne, your husband, slain.
In here!
In here, on the bed.
Get out!
Out!
Out!
Brok, out!
You stay, Bowen.
Forgive me, Queen Aislinn.
There' s nothing to forgive.
His father' s tyranny brought him to this end.
He' s beyond all help.
Not all.
A knight is sworn to valor.
Sworn to valor.
- His heart knows only virtue.
- Virtue.
His blade defends the helpless.
His might upholds the weak.
You must stay awake, my son!
- You must stay awake.
Repeat the Code.
- The Code.
His might upholds the weak.
H- His word speaks only truth.
His wrath --
Undoes the wicked.
Brok, stay there.
Lord!
Great one!
Your song is sad!
Are the stars shining tonight?
No.
No bright souls glitter in this darkness.
Leave us.
Go.
Aislinn, daughter of the Celts.
Whose people loved your kind and called you friend.
Ah, the king' s son... cruel and full of trickery.
- Is this why you' ve come, dragonslayer' s wife?
- Dragonslayer' s widow!
This boy is not his father.
This knight here is his mentor.
He has taught him the Old Code.
I need your help.
The wound is deep.
You know what you ask.
I will teach him your ways.
He will grow in your grace.
He will grow just and good.
I swear.
No!
The boy must swear.
Give me your sword, Knight.
Your sword!
Do not be afraid.
He can save you.
Now listen to me, boy.
Swear that your father' s blood lust and tyranny died with him.
Swear that you will live and rule with mercy.
Come to me and learn the Once- ways.
Now swear!
I swear.
He' s dead!
Peace, Knight of the Old Code.
Witness the wonders of an ancient glory.
Half my heart to make you whole.
Its strength to purify your weakness.
Live, and remember your oath.
I served the father only for the sake of the son.
All my hopes rest on him.
Forgive a doubting fool.
Call when you need of me.
Ask what you will of me.
My sword, my service are yours.
Only remind him always of his vow...
Knight of the Old Code.
Brok.
Your Majesty?
The Romans built this great fortress.
I will rebuild it, and mine will be greater.
It will take many men, my Lord, to rebuild this ruin.
Yes.
Yes, it will.
Not so rebellious now.
You should thank me, boy.
It was my stroke made you king.
No, Brok, I want no martyrs.
Death should be a release, not a punishment.
Look good, dog.
I' m the last thing you' il ever see.
Burn the insolence out of his eyes.
No!
No!
Not my eyes!
No!
Father!
Run!
How dare you defy me!
Einon, you' re unwell.
You' ve been bewitched.
Look at this!
It' s madness!
- Remember the Code!
- The king is above the Code!
Have you forgotten everything I taught you?
No one is above the Code... especially the king.
Dragon, I loved that boy, and you changed him!
You tricked me, Dragon!
No matter where you fly... no matter where you go, I will find you!
Today I make a new vow!
I will spend the rest of my life hunting you down!
Avalon, oh, Avalon.
For you I quest each day... the resting place of Arthur... and the Old Code of his way.
And when I find those holy stones...
I' il pray, I' il pray, I' il pray.
Oh, Avalon, bright Avalon... think me not a fool.
My quest is not for vanity, my quest is spiritual.
Spiritual!
Merlin, spiritual!
Merlin!
Ow!
Everyone' s a critic!
- Dragon, dragon.
- Yes, I know.
Where?
There, there.
Get back here, horse.
You coward.
Marvelous!
Heroics befitting the days of Arthur and the Round Table!
Never have I seen such skill!
Then you must have lived the sheltered life... of a mon -- monk.
Why, yes.
A scribe, scholar, historian and poet.
Your servant, sir, Brother Gilbert of Glockenspur.
My humble life is in debt to your exalted prowess... your dauntless courage, and your superb, swift sword.
You have the poet' s gift of exaggeration.
Sir, you should read my histories.
But you belittle your talent.
Modesty as well as valor.
The Code of ancient Camelot still lives.
Hardly worthy of Camelot.
Still, it' s one less dragon.
Well done, Knight!
Congratulations.
Our gratitude, mine and King Einon' s.
Uh, you can keep your gratitude.
I' il take the gold.
- Yours or the king' s.
- Gold, Knight?
We made a bargain, remember?
One dragon put down, one bag of gold.
Your honor has a price, Sir Knight?
It has expenses.
Honor won' t feed my belly nor shoe my horse.
The priest is right.
It is your duty to protect King Einon' s vassals as a knight of the realm.
Not of this realm.
I bend no knee to Einon.
I should have known.
Foreign riffraff!
Well, begone, vagabond, before I arrest you!
Back to work, you scum!
If King Einon' s wheat isn' t cut before the rain...
I' il do a little cutting of my own!
Sir Knight!
Sir Knight, wait!
Sir Knight!
Hear me out!
I' m on a pilgrimage.
Might we travel together?
The road' s still free, unless Einon' s taxed it.
A road tax, King Einon.
Hmm?
A road tax.
They are your roads, after all.
People really ought to pay for the privilege of using them.
- And those that can' t pay will have to work it off.
- lngenious, Felton.
Only you could keep such a good brain under such a bad hat.
That' s very good, "bad hat."
Out of my way, peacock.
Brok, some are good at hunting men, some are good at hunting money.
Both have value for me.
Kara?
Kara, I told you --
- I told you not to come here anymore.
- I' m a disobedient child.
Go on.
Take a drink.
Go on.
Magnificent shot, Your Highness!
- Care to double the wager?
- Ah, yes, happily.
Shall we say the water bucket?
Stand still.
Stand still.
Superb!
Double again?
Why not?
I say.
A moving target.
Peasant scum.
You' ve got a nerve, interfering with the king' s sport!
There' s no sport in tormenting a sick, old man.
It' s been 12 years.
Your castle is built.
He can do you no more harm.
For God' s sake, release him.
Father!
I' ve always said death is a release, not a punishment.
Go.
Kara.
I' ve decided to compose "The Ballad of Bowen"!
- How do you prefer I should write this?
- Far away!
Oh, don' t concern yourself with my safety!
I mean verse, meter.
Shall I spice it up with a poetical flourish... or just the cold, hard facts?
If you do not be quiet... you and I shall be the only things that are cold and hard around here.
I mean, it' s all very well to go hacking and whacking at dragons.
But if a dragon falls in the forest and nobody gets to hear about it, does it make a thud?
- Brother Gilbert.
- What?
The quill is mightier than the s --
The quill is mightier than the --
That' s all that' s left of the last dragonslayer... who tangled with me!
If I were you, I' d quit while I was ahead.
Is that the best you can do?
Catch!
You know, I' ve got quite a collection of victims in here.
I won' t be added to it!
I' ve given you my final warning.
Into the mouth of death he strode.
Into the gringy gloom.
Into the pit of fear unknown... perhaps to court his doom.
That was good.
What did I say?
What did I say?
A little damp for fire, isn' t it?
Why must you knight- errands out to make a name for yourselves... always pick on us dragons?
I don' t need a name!
And I have a collection of my own!
You' re one who kills dragons for money.
It' s honest enough work.
One must earn a living.
Oh, yes, one must live.
Well, since you seek a profit, we might as well begin.
Oh, don' t flatter yourself.
It' s not the profit.
It' s the pleasure.
Perhaps less pleasurable and more costly than you think!
Bowen!
Bowen, take care!
He went that way!
Take care, Bowen!
You can' t fly forever!
- Neither can you!
- Slow down!
Come, visit the woods!
Look out!
Well done!
- Ow!
That must have hurt.
- Again?
- And again?
How do you like the ride so far?
We' re earning our money now, aren' t we?
Now, is there somewhere you would like me to drop you off?
Yikes!
The sword against the fang and claw.
The flame against the shield.
Blah, blah, blah, which one would win?
Blah, blah, field, shield, wield.
Whose flesh from bones be peeled.
Oh, no.
Whose fate would soon be sealed.
Whose fate would soon be sealed?
Whose fate would soon be sealed!
Oh, you' re good.
Haven' t had this sort of challenge in some time.
Nor likely to again!
Drat!
A little overconfident, aren' t we?
Hardly.
But if you win, you' il be out of work.
I will not stop until I' ve rid the world of every last one of you.
I am the last one!
You' re just trying to save your scaly hide with tricks.
Haven' t you noticed the pickings are rather slim these days?
I got me one just the other day.
So it was you who killed the Scarred One.
She and I were the last.
Must' ve been a proud kill, warrior.
How much gold did her tattered carcass put in your purse?
That' s none of your business.
Couldn' t have been very much.
And you' il kill me for sport?
And when there are no more dragons to slay... how will you make a living, Knight?
Shut up!
If your teeth come down, my sword goes up, right into your brain!
If your sword goes up, my teeth come down!
Into the moonlit night the titans dueled... in mortal combat bound.
Oh, who' d the fatal false step make?
Whose blood would stain the ground?
Oh, good Lord.
Sir Eglamore.
Oh, thank you very much.
It' s been stuck down there for months.
Can you get your buttocks off my tongue?
Why should you be comfortable?
My armor is rusting in your drool, and your breath is absolutely foul.
Well, what do you expect... with old knights rotting between my molars?
Oh, God, my mouth is so dry.
No, no, no, stop!
No, stop!
Sorry about that.
It seems we' re in a bit of a stalemate, wouldn' t you say?
But I can go three days without sleep.
I can go three weeks.
I' il stab you before I nod off.
And I' il chomp you.
Marvelous, we' il kill each other.
- What do you suggest?
- A truce.
Get out of my mouth and let' s talk face- to- face.
How do I know I can trust you?
I give you my word.
The word of a dragon.
It' s worthless.
Stubborn lout!
I should have known!
Go on.
Kill me!
I don' t want to kill you!
I never did!
And I don' t want you to kill me!
How do we gain?
If you win, you lose a trade.
If I win, I wait around for the next sword slinger... thirsting to carve a reputation out of my hide.
And I' m tired of lurking in holes... and skulking in darkness.
I' m gonna let you up now.
And if you insist... we can pursue this fracas to its final stupidity.
Or you can listen to my alternative.
What' s the alternative?
Father, Father, look!
Dragon!
Out of the way!
Out of the way!
Out of the way!
Pesky critters, dragons.
You!
Like big rats.
You never seem to get rid of them.
Unless you pay me two bags of gold, in advance.
Come on, Dragon.
Come on, Dragon.
Yes!
Hello.
Twenty- eight, twenty- nine.
Most profitable, Dragon.
I should have met you a long time ago.
There is much gold in the world.
Perhaps when you' ve had your fill of it, you' il no longer need me.
I am a Knight of the Old Code.
My word is my bond.
- No compunctions then?
- About what?
Well, such deception hardly befits a Knight of the Old Code.
That' s a service to mankind.
Is it?
When you squeeze the nobility, it' s the peasants who feel the pinch.
That' s not my concern.
Why should I stick my neck out for people afraid to risk their own?
Don' t clutter up a clever scheme with morality.
Mmm, so be it...
Knight of the Old Code.
If I wanted my conscience pricked, I would have stayed with the priest!
And what does a dragon know of the Old Code, anyway?
His blade defends the helpless.
His might upholds the weak.
His word speaks only truth.
Shut up!
I remember.
That' s all it is, a memory.
Nothing can bring it back.
You sound like one who tried.
And failed.
So I no longer try to change the world, Dragon.
I just try to get by in it.
Yes, it' s better than death, I suppose.
Oh, is it?
I should think you' d welcome death.
You know, the last of your kind, all your friends dead, hunted wherever you go.
Do you delight in reminding me?
Yes, Knight, I do long for death.
But fear it.
Why?
Aside from your misery, what' s to lose?
My soul.
Finish him, Brok!
Well, are you a man?
Should he continue, Mother?
Oh, the field belongs to the apparently inexhaustible Sir Brok, my son.
The quarry!
First you beg mercy for your father' s fate.
Then you try to avenge it.
Now, you' il share it.
In your kingdom, Einon, there are worse fates than death.
I' il think one up for you.
- Take her away.
- No!
No!
He killed my father!
He killed my father!
He killed my father!
I remember you now.
I remember you.
Your hair, like fire.
You gave me this scar.
Didn' t you?
I... owe... you.
I can, uh --
I really can.
Sorry, Bowen.
I hope you like it well done.
You must have hated us very much.
I hated one of you.
These I killed because I wanted to kill him.
But I never found him.
I never will.
If you' re the last, he must be dead.
Oh, yes.
Tell me, what was he like... this, uh, dragon that you hated?
He only had half a heart.
But even that was enough to pollute an innocent boy.
Einon was no innocent!
He polluted the heart!
How do you know that?
How do you know that, Dragon?
All dragons know that story.
What was to be their hope became their doom.
A spoiled, ungrateful child was given a great gift and destroyed it!
No!
I knew Einon.
I was his teacher.
I taught him the ways of honor, of right.
Then he betrayed you... just as he betrayed the dragon whose heart he broke.
That' s a lie, Dragon!
Stop calling me "Dragon"!
I have a name.
Well, what is it?
You couldn' t possibly pronounce it in your tongue.
- Try me.
- It' s --
Next time stab more flesh, less cloth.
I' il pierce your heart!
You already did.
A very special heart, like no other.
A black, withered thing without pity.
Then teach me.
Pity me.
I' il give you everything.
Even power.
You' re so beautiful.
Even power.
Even a throne.
Oh, dear.
Thank you.
It' s passed now.
What was it?
An old complaint that acts up now and again.
Forgive me if anything I said, if I upset you.
It wasn' t you, not you.
Don' t be afraid.
I won' t let you suffer the same fate as me.
I' ve come to help you.
This will bring you out well below the castle walls.
Thank --
You.
Have you been watching over me all night?
I' ve been thinking.
Yes?
About what?
Many things.
Mostly about what to call you.
I think I' ve found you a name.
You say that as though you reached up and plucked it from the sky.
I did.
Up there.
Do you see that group of stars?
I know those stars very well.
- Do you see the shape that they make?
- Mm- hmm, a dragon.
Yes.
They call it "Draco."
It means "dragon" in the scholars' speech.
So instead of calling me "Dragon" in your tongue... you' il call me "Dragon" in some other tongue.
You' re right.
It' s silly.
No.
No, I would be honored to be named after those stars.
I -- I truly would.
Thank you, Bowen.
Draco.
Throw off the yoke of Einon' s oppression!
We must start to fight back!
Your father sang that sour tune once, and we did fight back.
And once was enough!
We' il not dance to it again!
No, Hewe, just cringe like a dog under Einon' s boot.
At least a cringing dog' s a live one!
Why waste good food on bad rhetoric?
I speak the truth.
Truth?
It' s rarely inspiring, lass.
And it never wins rebellions... but it will stretch necks, if there is a neck... underneath that little mud pie.
Ready or not, here I come!
Dragon!
It' s Draco!
About time.
It seems you people are in need of a dragonslayer.
Where is the lord responsible for this village?
Brok lives in a big house about six miles away.
But he' il only blame any damage on us and pluck our pockets to pay for it.
I won' t pluck them as deeply.
I' il make you a fair offer.
Take it, or leave him!
It' s enough you people grovel to Einon.
Will you be bullied by some broken- down, blackmailing knight as well?
That' s right, you don' t need me.
Settle it yourself.
Of course, there are other ways.
Perhaps you' il part with... one of your precious daughters, instead of gold.
Dragons are partial to maiden sacrifices, I hear.
People are always asking me if I know Tyler Durden.
Tyler:
3 minutes.
Would you like to say a few words to mark the occasion?
With a gun barrel between your teeth, you speak only in vowels.
I can' t think of anything.
For a second I totally forget about Tyler' s whole controlled demolition thing, and I wonder how clean that gun is.
Getting exciting now.
That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love?
Well, it works both ways.
We have front row seats for this theater of mass destruction.
The demolitions committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of a dozen buildings with blasting gelatin.
In 2 minutes, primary charges will blow base charges and a few square blocks will be reduced to smoldering rubble.
I know this... because Tyler knows this.
2 1/ 2.
Think of everything we' ve accomplished.
Bob.
Bob had bitch- tits.
This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.
The big moosey slobbering all over me, that was Bob.
We' re still men.
Yes, we' re men.
Men is what we are.
8 months ago, Bob' s testicles were removed.
Then hormone therapy.
He developed bitch- tits because his testosterone was too high, and his body upped the estrogen.
And that was where I fit...
Between those huge, sweating tits that hung enormous the way you' d think of God' s as big.
You cry now.
No, wait.
Back up.
For 6 months, I couldn' t sleep.
I couldn' t sleep.
With insomnia, nothing' s real.
Everything' s far away.
Everything' s a copy of a copy of a copy.
Planet Starbucks.
We got some red flags to cover.
It must' ve been Tuesday.
He was wearing his cornflower- blue tie.
You want me to deprioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade?
Make these your primary action items.
Call me from the road if there' s any snags.
Narrator:
Must have had his grandé latté enema.
Like so many others, I had become a slave to the IKEA nesting instinct.
Uh, yes.
I' d like to order the Erica Pekkary dust ruffles.
Operator:
like a little coffee table in the shape of a Yin- Yang,
The Klipske personal office unit, the Hovetrekke home exer- bike, or the Johannshamn sofa with the Strinne green stripe pattern.
Even the Rizlampa wire lamps of environmentally friendly unbleached paper.
I' d flip through catalogs and wonder:
What kind of dining set defines me as a person?
I had it all.
Proof that they were crafted by the honest, simple, hard- working indigenous peoples of --
Narrator:
We used to read pornography.
Now it was the Horchow collection.
No, you can' t die from insomnia.
What about narcolepsy?
I wake up in strange places.
I have no idea how I got there.
You need to lighten up.
Can you please just get me something?
Red and blue Tuenols, lipstick- red Seconals.
No.
You need healthy natural sleep.
Chew some Valerian root and get more exercise.
Hey, come on.
I' m in pain.
You wanna see pain?
Swing by First Methodist Tuesday nights.
See the guys with testicular cancer.
That' s pain.
I always wanted 3 kids, 2 boys and a girl.
Mindy wanted 2 girls and a boy.
We never could agree on anything.
Well, uh, you know, she --
She had her first child last week, a... a girl.
With -- With her, uh, with her new husband.
Fuck.
Hey -- Hey, thank God, you know.
I' m -- I' m glad for her.
Because she deserves it.
Everyone, let' s thank Thomas for sharing himself with us.
Thank you, Thomas.
I look around this room, and I see a lot of courage, and that gives me strength.
We give each other strength.
It' s time for the one- on- ones.
So let' s all of us here follow Thomas' good example and really open ourselves up.
Would you find a partner?
And this is how I met the big moosey...
Let' s go over here.
His eyes already shrink- wrapped in tears... knees together, those awkward little steps.
My name is Bob.
Bob.
Bob had been a champion body- builder.
You know that chest- expansion program you see on late- night TV?
That was his idea.
I was a juicer.
You know, using steroids.
Diabonal and...
Oh, they use that on racehorses, for Christ sakes.
And now I' m bankrupt.
I' m divorced.
My 2 grown kids... won' t even return my phone calls.
Strangers with this kind of honesty make me go a big rubbery one.
Go ahead, Cornelius.
And then, something happened.
I let go.
That' s really good.
Lost in oblivion... dark and silent and complete.
I found freedom.
Losing all hope was freedom.
It' s OK.
Babies don' t sleep this well.
I became addicted.
If I didn' t say anything... people always assumed the worst.
Welcome, Travis.
They cried harder... then I cried harder.
Now we' re going to open the green door, the heart chakra.
I wasn' t really dying.
I wasn' t host to cancer or parasites.
I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around. that the life of this world crowded around.
Imagine your pain as a white ball of healing light.
It moves over your body, healing you.
Now, keep this going.
Remember to breathe, and step forward through the back door of the room.
Where does it lead?
To your cave.
Step forward into your cave.
That' s right.
You' re going deeper into your cave, and you' re going to find your power animal.
Slide.
Narrator:
Every evening, I died... and every evening, I was born again.
Resurrected.
Bob loved me because he thought my testicles were removed, too.
Being there... pressed against his tits, ready to cry.
This was my vacation.
And she ruined everything.
This is cancer, right?
This chick Marla Singer did not have testicular cancer.
She was a liar.
She had no diseases at all.
I had seen her at Free and Clear my blood parasites group Thursdays.
Then at Hope, my bimonthly sickle cell circle.
[Coughs Softly]
Marla, the big tourist.
Her lie reflected my lie, and suddenly, I felt nothing.
I couldn' t cry.
So once again, I couldn' t sleep.
Marla Singer and scream...
Marla, you liar!
I need this!
Now get out!
I hadn' t slept in 4 days.
We' il just let that dry.
When you have insomnia, you' re never really asleep... and you' re never really awake.
Chloe would like to say a few words.
Oh, yeah...
Meryl Streep' s skeleton would look if you made it smile and walk around the party being extra nice to everybody.
Well, I' m still here, but I don' t know for how long.
That' s as much certainty as anyone can give me.
But I' ve got some good news.
I no longer have any fear of death.
But I am in a pretty lonely place.
No one will have sex with me.
I' m so close to the end, and all I want is to get laid for the last time.
I have pornographic movies in my apartment,
and lubricants and amyl nitrate.
Chloe...
Everyone, let' s thank Chloe.
[Audience Saying Thank You]
Now, let' s... ready ourself for guided meditation.
You' re standing at the entrance of your cave.
You step inside your cave, and you walk.
If I did have a tumor...
I' d name it Marla.
Marla... the little scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop tonguing it, but you can' t.... deeper into your cave as you walk.
You feel the healing energy of this place all around you.
Now find your power animal.
Slide.
Now let' s partner up.
Pick someone special to you tonight.
Hey.
We need to talk.
Sure.
I' m onto you.
What?
You' re a faker.
You' re not dying.
Sorry?
I know we' re all -- we' re all dying, all right?
So?
So you' re a tourist.
I saw you -- saw you at melanoma, saw you at tuberculosis,
I saw you at testicular cancer.
I saw you practicing this.
Practicing what?
Is it going as well as you hoped...
"RUPERT"?
I' il expose you.
Go ahead.
I' il expose you.
Let yourselves cry.
[Crying Softly]
Oh, God, why are you doing this?
It' s cheaper than a movie, and there' s free coffee.
No, look... this is important, OK?
I' ve been coming here for over a year.
Why do you do it?
When people think you' re dying, man, they really, really listen to you instead of just...
Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.
Yeah.
Share yourself... completely.
OK, you don' t want to get into this.
It becomes an addiction.
Really?
I can' t cry if there' s another faker present, and I need this.
So you got to find somewhere else to go.
Candy stripe a cancer ward.
It' s not my problem.
Wait, wait, wait.
I' il tell you.
You take lymphoma and tuberculosis --
You take tuberculosis.
My smoking doesn' t go over at all.
- OK.
Fine.
Testicular cancer should be no contest, I think.
Well, technically,
I have more right to be there than you.
You' re kidding.
I don' t know.
No.
No.
What do you want?
I' il take the parasites.
You can' t have both the parasites, but why don' t you take the blood parasites --
I want brain parasites.
I' il take the blood parasites, but I' m gonna take the organic brain dementia --
You can' t have the whole brain.
So far you have 4.
I only have 2.
Take both the parasites.
They' re yours.
Now we both have 3.
Hey, you left half your clothes!
What, are you selling those?
I' m selling some clothes.
That' s 6.
What about the seventh day?
I want ascending bowel cancer.
Thank you.
No.
No, I...
That' s your favorite, too?
Try to slip it by me, eh?
Look, we' re gonna split it, OK?
Take the first and third Sunday of the month.
Deal.
Looks like this is good- bye.
Well, let' s not make a big thing out of it, OK?
How' s this for not making a big thing?
Hey, Marla!
Marla!
May- Maybe we should exchange numbers.
Should we?
OK.
This is how I met Marla Singer.
Marla' s philosophy of life was that she might die at any moment.
The tragedy, she said, was that she didn' t.
It doesn' t have your name.
Who are you,
Cornelius, Rupert,
Travis, any of the stupid names you give each night?
You wake up at Seatac.
S. F. O...
L. A. X...
Dallas- Fort Worth...
B. W. I...
Pacific, mountain, central...
Lose an hour, gain an hour...
Check- in for that flight doesn' t begin for another 2 hours, sir.
This is your life, and it' s ending one minute at a time.
You wake up at Air Harbor International...
If you wake up at a different time, in a different place, could you wake up as a different person?
Everywhere I travel, tiny life... single- serving sugar... single- serving cream... single pat of butter... a microwave cordon- bleu hobby kit.
Shampoo- conditioner combos.
Sample package mouthwash, tiny bars of soap.
The people I meet on each flight, they' re single- serving friends.
Between takeoff and landing, we have our time together, but that' s all we get.
Welcome!
On a long enough timeline, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.
I was a recall coordinator.
My job was to apply the formula.
Here' s where the infant went through the windshield.
A new car built by my company
leaves somewhere traveling at 60 miles per hour.
The teenager' s braces are wrapped around the back seat ashtray.
Might make a good antismoking ad.
The car crashes and burns with everyone trapped inside.
Now, should we initiate a recall?
The father must' ve been huge.
You see where the fat has burned to the seat, the polyester shirt?
- Ha ha ha!
Narrator:
Take the number of vehicles in the field, "A," multiply it by the probable rate of failure, "B," then multiply the result by the average out- of- court settlement, "C."
"A" times "B" times "C" equals "X."
If" X "is less than the cost of a recall, we don' t do one.
Are there a lot of these kinds of accidents?
You wouldn' t believe.
Which car company do you work for?
A major one.
I prayed for a crash or a midair collision.
Anything.
Life insurance pays off triple if you die on a business trip.
"And you feel you would be unable or unwilling to perform the duties
It' s a lot of responsibility.
Wanna switch seats?
I' m not sure I' m the man for that particular job.
Mm- hmm.
The illusion of safety.
Yeah.
You know why they put oxygen masks on planes?
So you can breathe.
Oxygen gets you high.
In a catastrophic emergency, you' re taking giant panicked breaths.
Suddenly you become euphoric, docile.
You accept your fate.
It' s all right here.
Emergency water landing -- 600 miles an hour.
Blank faces, calm as Hindu cows.
That' s, um...
That' s an interesting theory.
What do you do?
What do you do for a living?
Why?
So you can pretend like you' re interested?
OK.
You have a kind of sick desperation in your laugh.
We have the exact same briefcase.
Soap.
Sorry?
I make and I sell soap -- the yardstick of civilization.
And this is how I met...
"Tyler Durden."
Did you know, if you mixed equal parts of gasoline and frozen orange juice concentrate, you can make napalm?
No, I did not know that.
That' s right.
One can make all kinds of explosives using simple household items.
Really?
If one were so inclined.
"single- serving" friend I' ve ever met.
See, obviously, everything on a plane is single- serving, even --
Oh, I get it.
It' s very clever.
Thank you.
How' s that working out for you?
Being clever.
Great.
Right up.
Now a question of etiquette.
As I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch?
Narrator:
How I came to live with Tyler is... airlines have this policy about vibrating luggage.
Was -- Was it ticking?
'cause modern bombs don' t tick.
"Throwers"?
Baggage handlers.
But when a suitcase vibrates, then the thrower' s gotta call the police.
My suitcase... was vibrating?
9 times out of 10, it' s an electric razor, but every once in a while...
it' s a dildo.
Of course, it' s company policy never to imply ownership in the event of a dildo.
Never your dildo.
I don' t own a --
Narrator:
I had everything in that suitcase -- my CK shirts, my DKNY shoes, my AX ties.
Never mind.
Hey!
That' s my car!
Home was a condo on the 15th floor of a filing cabinet for widows and young professionals.
The walls were solid concrete.
A foot of concrete' s important when your next- door neighbor lets her hearing aid go and has to watch game shows at full volume...
Or when a volcanic blast and debris that used to be your furniture and personal effects blows out of your floor- to- ceiling windows and sails flaming into the night.
I suppose these things happen.
There' s nothing up there.
You can' t go into the unit.
Do you have somebody you can call?
Narrator:
A house full of condiments and no food.
letting out just a little bit of gas.
That gas could have slowly filled the condo -- 1, 700 square feet of high ceilings for days and days.
[Telephone Ringing]
Yeah?
I can hear you breathing, you --
I couldn' t tell you why I called him.
Hello?
Man:
Tyler?
Who is this?
Um, ahem, we met on the airplane.
We had the same suitcase.
Uh, the clever guy.
Oh, yeah.
OK?
I called a second ago.
Yeah.
I star- 69ed you.
So, what' s up, man?
Uh, well... you' re not gonna believe this.
You know, man, it could be worse.
A woman could cut off your penis while you' re sleeping and toss it out the window of a moving car.
There' s always that.
I don' t know, it' s just... when you buy furniture, you tell yourself, that' s it.
That' s the last sofa I' m gonna need.
I' ve got that sofa problem handled.
I had it all.
I had a stereo that was very decent, a wardrobe that was getting very respectable.
I was close to being complete.
Now it' s all gone.
All gone.
All gone.
Do you know what a duvet is?
Comforter.
It' s a blanket. just a blanket.
Why do guys like you and I know what a duvet is?
Is this essential to our survival in the hunter- gatherer sense of the word?
No.
What are we, then?
We' re, uh, you know, consumers...
We' re consumers.
We are by- products of a lifestyle obsession.
Murder, crime, poverty -- these things don' t concern me.
What concerns me are celebrity magazines, television with 500 channels, some guy' s name on my underwear.
Rogaine, Viagra, Olestra.
Martha Stewart.
Fuck Martha Stewart.
Martha' s polishing the brass on the Titanic.
It' s all going down, man.
So fuck off with your sofa units and Strinne green stripe patterns.
I say, never be complete.
I say, stop being perfect.
let' s evolve.
Let the chips fall where they may.
But that' s me, and I could be wrong.
Maybe it' s a terrible tragedy.
No.
It' s not a tragedy, but...
Well, you did lose a lot of versatile solutions for modern living.
You' re right.
I don' t smoke.
My insurance is probably gonna cover it, so...
What?
The things you own end up owning you.
But do what you like, man.
Oh, it' s late.
Hey, thanks for the beer.
Yeah, man.
I should find a hotel.
What?
What?
A hotel.
Yeah. just ask, man.
What are you talking about?
3 pitchers of beer, and you still can' t ask.
What?
You called me 'cause you needed a place to stay.
Oh, hey, no, no, no.
Yes, you did.
Cut the foreplay and just ask, man.
Would that be a problem?
Is it a problem for you to ask?
Can I stay at your place?
Thanks.
I want you to do me a favor.
Yeah, sure.
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
What?
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Durden.
Tyler was a night person.
While the rest of us were sleeping, he worked.
He had one part- time job as a projectionist.
See, a movie doesn' t come all on one big reel.
It comes on a few.
So someone has to be there to switch the projectors at the exact moment that one reel ends and the next one begins.
If you look for it, you can see these little dots come into the upper right- hand corner of the screen.
In the industry, we call them "cigarette burns."
That' s the cue for a changeover.
He flips the projectors, the movie keeps right on going, and nobody in the audience has any idea.
Why would anyone want this shit job?
Because it affords him other interesting opportunities.
Like splicing single frames of pornography into family films.
So when the snooty cat and the courageous dog with the celebrity voices meet for the first time in reel 3, that' s when you' il catch a flash of Tyler' s contribution to the film.
Nobody knows that they saw it, but they did.
A nice big cock.
Even a hummingbird couldn' t catch Tyler at work.
Tyler also works sometimes as a banquet waiter at the luxurious Pressman Hotel.
He was the guerilla terrorist of the food service industry.
Do not watch.
And as for the cream of mushroom soup, well...
Go ahead, tell them.
You get the idea.
What do you want me to do?
You just want me to hit you?
Do me this one favor.
Why?
I don' t know.
Have you?
No, but that' s a good thing.
No, it is not.
I don' t wanna die without any scars.
So, come on, hit me before I lose my nerve.
God, this is crazy.
So go crazy.
Let 'er rip.
Hey, I don' t know about this.
I don' t, either, but who gives a shit?
What do you care?
This is crazy.
You want me to hit you?
That' s right.
What, like, in the face?
Surprise me.
This is so fucking stupid.
Motherfucker!
You hit me in the ear.
Ow!
Christ!
Why the ear, man?
That was perfect.
Nah, it' s all right.
That really hurts.
Right.
[Laughing]
You hit me.
Come on.
We should do this again sometime.
Where' s your car?
What car?
I don' t know how Tyler found that house, but he said he' d been there for a year.
It looked like it was waiting to be torn down.
Most of the windows were boarded up.
There was no lock on the front door from when the police or whoever kicked it in.
The stairs were ready to collapse.
I didn' t know if he owned it or if he was squatting.
Neither would have surprised me.
Yeah.
That' s you.
That' s me.
That' s the toilet.
Thanks.
Narrator:
[Springs Clang]
Turning on one light meant another light in the house went out.
There were no neighbors, just some warehouses and a paper mill -- that fart smell of steam, the hamster cage smell of wood chips.
What have we here?
Hey, guys.
Hey.
Every time it rained, we had to kill the power.
I didn' t miss TV.
I didn' t even mind the warm, stale refrigerator.
Can I be next?
All right, man.
Lose the tie.
At night, Tyler and I were alone for a half a mile in every direction.
Rain trickled down through the plaster and the light fixtures.
Everything wooden swelled and shrank.
Everywhere were rusted nails to snag your elbow on.
The previous occupant had been a bit of a shut- in.
Hey, man, what are you reading?
It' s an article written by an organ in the first person.
"I am Jack' s medulla oblongata.
Without me, Jack could not regulate his heart rate, blood pressure, or breathing. "
There' s a whole series of these.
"I am Jack' s colon."
Yeah.
I kill Jack. "
After fighting, everything else in your life got the volume turned down.
[Muted Complaining]
What?
Have you finished those reports?
If you could fight anyone, who would you fight?
I' d fight my boss, probably.
Really?
Yeah.
Why, who would you fight?
I' d fight my dad.
I don' t know my dad.
I mean, I know him, but he left when I was, like, 6 years old, married this other woman and had some other kids.
He, like, did this every 6 years.
He goes to a new city and starts a new family.
Fucker should open up franchises.
My dad never went to college, so it was real important that I go.
That sounds familiar.
So I graduate, I call him up long distance.
I say, "Dad, now what?"
He says, "Get a job."
Same here.
Now I' m 25.
I make my yearly call again.
I say, "Dad, now what?"
He says, "I don' t know.
Get married. "
I can' t get married.
I' m a 30- year- old boy.
We' re a generation of men raised by women.
I' m wondering if another woman is really the answer we need.
Most of the week, we were Ozzie and Harriet.
But every Saturday night, we were finding something out.
We were finding out more and more that we were not alone.
It used to be that when I came home angry or depressed,
I' d just clean my condo, polish my Scandinavian furniture.
I should' ve been haggling with my insurance company.
I should' ve been upset about my nice, neat flaming little shit.
But I wasn' t.
The basic premise of cyber- netting any office is make things more efficient.
Monday mornings, all I could do was think about next week.
Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?
Absolutely.
Efficiency is priority number one, people, because waste is a thief.
I showed this already to my man, here.
You liked it, didn' t you?
You can swallow a pint of blood before you get sick.
It was right in everyone' s face.
Tyler and I just made it visible.
It was on the tip of everyone' s tongue.
Tyler and I just gave it a name.
Come on, people, you gotta go home.
Turn off the jukebox.
Lock the back.
Every week, Tyler gave the rules that he and I decided.
Gentlemen, welcome to Fight Club.
The first rule of Fight Club is... you do not talk about Fight Club.
The second rule of Fight Club is... you do not talk about Fight Club.
Third rule of Fight Club --
Someone yells "Stop!" goes limp, taps out, the fight is over.
Only 2 guys to a fight.
Fifth rule --
One fight at a time, fellas.
[Laughter]
Sixth rule -- No shirts, no shoes.
Seventh rule --
Fights will go on as long as they have to.
And the eighth and final rule --
If this is your first night at Fight Club... you have to fight.
This kid from work, Ricky, couldn' t remember whether you ordered pens with blue ink or black...
But Ricky was a god for 10 minutes when the trounced the maitre d 'of a local food court.
Sometimes, all you could hear were the flat, hard packing sounds over the yelling...
or the wet choke when someone caught their breath and sprayed...
Stop!
You weren' t alive anywhere like you were there.
But Fight Club only exists in the hours between when Fight Club starts and when Fight Club ends.
I wouldn' t be talking to the same man.
Who you were in Fight Club is not who you were in the rest of the world.
The guy who came to Fight Club for the first time, his ass was a wad of cookie dough.
After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.
If you could fight any celebrity, who would you fight?
Alive or dead?
It doesn' t matter.
Who' d be tough?
Hemingway.
You?
I' d fight William Shatner.
We all started seeing things differently.
Everywhere we went, we were sizing things up.
I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms, trying to look like how Calvin Klein or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.
Is that what a man looks like?
Self- improvement is masturbation.
And self- destruction.
Excuse me.
Fight Club wasn' t about winning or losing.
It wasn' t about words.
like in a Pentecostal church.
- Stop!
When the fight was over, nothing was solved, but nothing mattered.
Hey, cool.
Narrator:
Afterwards, we all felt saved.
Hey, man, how about next week?
How about next month?
Irwin, you' re in the middle.
You, too.
Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.
He fell down some stairs.
I fell down some stairs.
Fight Club became the reason to cut your hair short or trim your fingernails.
Any historical figure.
I' d fight Gandhi.
Good answer.
How about you?
Lincoln.
Mm.
Big guy, big reach.
Skinny guys fight till they' re burger.
Fuck.
Even the Mona Lisa' s falling apart.
Hello.
Where have you been the last 8 weeks?
Marla?
How' d you find me?
You left that forwarding number.
I haven' t seen you in any support groups.
We split them up.
That was the idea, remember?
Yeah, but you haven' t been going to yours.
How do you know?
I cheated.
I found a new one.
Really?
Like the testicle thing?
Look, this is a bad time.
I' ve been going to Debtors Anonymous.
You wanna see some really fucked up people?
I' m just on my way out.
I' ve got a stomachful of Xanax.
I took what was left of a bottle.
It might have been too much.
Just picture watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.
But this isn' t a for- real suicide thing.
This is probably one of those cry- for- help things.
So you' re staying in tonight, then?
Do you wanna wait and hear me describe death?
Do you wanna listen and see if my spirit can use a phone?
Have you ever heard a death rattle before?
Tyler' s door was closed.
I' d been living here for 2 months, and Tyler' s door was never closed.
You won' t believe this dream I had last night.
Yeah, I can hardly believe anything about last night.
What -- What are you doing here?
What?
This is my house.
What are you doing in my house?
Fuck you.
Oh, you got some fucked- up friends, I' m tellin 'you.
[Chuckling]
Limber, though... silly coos.
So, I come in last night.
Guess who' s on the other end.
I already knew the story before he told it to me.
Have you ever heard a death rattle before?
Do you think it' il live up to its name?
Or will it just be a death... hairball?
Prepare... to evacuate soul.
9... 8...
Marla:
5... 4... 3 -- Oh, hang on.
You got here fast.
Did I call you?
The mattress is all sealed in slippery plastic.
[Rattling]
Oh, don' t worry.
Oh, fuck.
Somebody called the cops.
Hey, where' s 513?
End of the hall.
You know, the girl who lives there used to be a charming, lovely girl.
She' s lost faith in herself.
Miss Singer!
She' s a monster.
You have every reason to live!
She' s infectious human waste!
Miss Singer!
Good luck trying to save her!
If I fall asleep, I' m done for.
You' re gonna have to keep me up... all... night.
Un- fucking- believable.
He was obviously able to handle it.
You fucked her.
No, I didn' t.
Never?
You' re not into her, are you?
God, not at all.
I am Jack' s raging bile duct.
Are you sure?
Believe me, I' m sure.
Put a gun to my head and paint the walls with my brains.
That' s good, 'cause she' s a predator posing as a house pet.
Stay away from that one.
And the shit that came out of this woman' s mouth
My God.
I haven' t been fucked like that since grade school.
Narrator:
The night before last, he was splicing sex organs into Cinderella.
She needs a fucking case worker.
She needs a wash.
And she' s in love with sport fuckin '.
She invaded my support groups.
Hey, hey.
Can' t have you talking to her about me.
Why would I talk to her --
You say anything about me or what goes on in this house to her or to anybody, we' re done.
Now, promise me.
OK.
You promise?
- Yeah, I promise.
- Promise.
I just said I promise.
That' s 3 times you promised.
If only I had wasted a couple of minutes and gone to watch Marla Singer die, none of this would' ve happened.
Oh!
Harder!
[Tyler And Marla Shouting Passionately]
Marla:
But I didn' t.
What are you doin '? just goin' to bed.
[Marla Moans]
No.
I found the cigarettes.
Who are you talking to?
I became the calm little center of the world.
I was the Zen master.
Ohh!
I wrote little haiku poems.
I e- mailed them to everyone.
Is that your blood?
Some of it, yeah.
[Snickers]
Take the rest of the day off.
Come back Monday with some clean clothes.
Get yourself together.
I got right in everyone' s hostile little face.
Yes, these are bruises from fighting.
Yes, I' m comfortable with that.
I... am enlightened.
Ohh!
[Ring]
This is Detective Stern with the Arson Unit.
We have some new information about the incident at your former condo.
I don' t know if you' re aware, but it seems that someone sprayed freon into your front door lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
No, I wasn' t aware of that at all.
I am Jack' s cold sweat.
Does this sound strange to you?
Strange.
Very strange.
Dynamite?
left a residue of ammonium oxylate potassium chloride.
Do you know what this means?
What does it mean?
It means it was homemade.
This is just coming as quite a shock to me, sir.
See, whoever set this homemade dynamite could' ve blown out your pilot light days before the actual explosion.
The gas was just the detonator.
Who would go and do such a thing?
I' il ask the questions.
Tell him the liberator who destroyed my property has realigned my perception.
Are you there?
No, I am listening.
It' s a little hard to know what to make of all this.
Have you recently made enemies with anyone who might have access to homemade dynamite?
- Reject the basic assumption of civilization, especially the importance of material possessions.
Detective:
Yes, I know it' s serious.
I mean that.
Yes, it' s very serious.
Look, nobody takes this more seriously than me.
That condo was my life.
I loved every stick of furniture in that place.
That was not just a bunch of stuff that got destroyed.
I' d like to thank the Academy.
Is this not a good time for you? just tell him you fuckin 'did it.
Tell him you blew it all up.
That' s what he wants to hear.
Are you still there?
Wait.
Are you saying that I' m a suspect?
No, no.
I may need to talk to you a little further, so how about you just lettin 'me know if you' re gonna leave town?
OK?
OK.
Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
My parents pulled this exact same act for years.
The condom is the glass slipper of our generation.
You slip one on when you meet a stranger.
You... dance all night.
Then you throw it away.
The condom, I mean.
What?
I got this dress at a thrift store for $1. 00.
It was worth every penny.
It' s a bridesmaid' s dress.
Someone loved it... intensely for one day... then tossed it.
Like a Christmas tree... so special... then... bam... it' s on the side of the road... tinsel still clinging to it...
like a sex crime victim... underwear inside out... bound with electrical tape.
Well, then it suits you.
You can borrow it sometime.
Get rid of her.
Why can' t you get rid of her?
Don' t mention me.
I' m 6 years old again, passing messages between parents.
I really think it' s time you got out of here.
Not that we don' t love your little visits.
You are such a nut case.
I can' t even begin to keep up.
Gotta get off
Bye.
Gotta get off this merry- go- round
[Continues Singing, Indistinctly]
Gotta get on where
You kids.
Why do you still waste time with her?
I' il say this about Marla -- at least she' s tryin 'to hit bottom.
What, and I' m not?
Stickin 'feathers up your butt does not make you a chicken.
What are we doin 'tonight?
- Tonight?
- Yeah.
Really.
To make soap, first we render fat.
The salt balance has to be just right, so the best fat for making soap comes from humans.
What is this place?
A liposuction clinic.
Pay dirt.
The richest, creamiest fat in the world.
Come on.
Oh, God!
Oh!
As the fat renders, the tallows float to the surface.
Like in Boy Scouts.
I can imagine you as a Boy Scout.
Keep stirrin '.
Once the tallow hardens, we skim off a layer of glycerin.
If you were to add nitric acid, you got nitroglycerin.
If you were then to add sodium nitrate and a dash of sawdust, you got dynamite.
Yeah, with enough soap, we could blow up just about anything.
Tyler was full of useful information.
Now, ancient peoples found that clothes got cleaner when they washed them at a certain point in the river.
- You know why?
Human sacrifices were once made on the hills above this river.
Bodies burned.
Water seeped into the wood and ashes to create lye.
This is lye, the crucial ingredient.
Once it mixed with the melted fat of bodies, a thick, white, soapy discharge crept into the river.
May I see your hand, please?
What is this?
Uh -- Aah!
It' il hurt more than you' ve ever been burned, and you will have a scar.
If meditation worked for cancer, it could work for this.
Don' t shove to center.
No, no!
The first soap was made from the ashes of heroes,
Without pain, without sacrifice, we would have nothin '.
I tried not to think of the the words "sear" or "flesh."
This is your burning hand.
I' m going to my cave and find my power animal.
No!
Don' t deal with it the way those dead people do!
Come on!
Please!
No.
What you' re feeling is premature enlightenment.
This is the greatest moment of your life, man, and you' re off somewhere --
Shut up.
Our fathers were our models for God.
If our fathers bailed, what does that tell you about God?
No, no.
You have to consider the possibility that God does not like you,
He never wanted you.
In all probability, He hates you.
This is not the worst thing that can happen.
We don' t need Him.
Fuck damnation, man.
We are God' s unwanted children?
So be it!
Listen!
You can run water over your hand to make it worse, or -- look at me -- or you can use vinegar to neutralize the burn.
Please let me have some!
First you have to give up.
First you have to know, not fear, know that someday you' re gonna die.
You don' t know how this feels!
It' s only after we' ve lost everything that we' re free to do anything.
OK.
Congratulations.
You' re one step closer to hitting bottom.
Tyler sold his soap to department stores at $20 a bar.
God knows what they charged.
This is the best soap.
Why, thank you, Suzie.
It was beautiful.
We were selling rich women their own fat asses back to them.
He was wearing his yellow tie.
I didn' t even wear a tie to work anymore.
"The first rule of Fight Club is you don' t talk about Fight Club"?
I' m half asleep again.
I must' ve left the original in the copy machine.
"The second rule of Fight Club --" Is this yours?
Pretend you' re me.
Make a managerial decision.
You find this.
What would you do?
I' d be very, very careful who you talk to about that.
Because the person who wrote that... is dangerous.
And this buttoned- down, Oxford- cloth psycho might just snap and then stalk from office to office with an Armilade AR- 10 carbine gas- powered semi- automatic weapon, pumping round after round into colleagues and coworkers.
This might be someone you' ve known for years... someone very... very... close to you.
Tyler' s words coming out of my mouth.
And I used to be such a nice guy.
Maybe you shouldn' t bring me every little piece of trash you happen to pick up.
Liability.
My tit' s gonna rot off.
I need to take this.
What' re you talking about?
I need you to check and see if there' s a lump in my breast.
Go to a hospital.
I can' t afford to throw money away on a doctor.
I don' t know about this, Marla.
Please?
She didn' t call Tyler.
I' m neutral in her book.
That' s nice.
Hannaburr, Mrs. Raines?
Who are they... exactly?
Tragically, they' re dead.
I' m alive, and I' m in poverty.
You want any?
I got one for you.
Thanks for the thought.
What happened to your hand?
Uh... nothin '.
Uhh.
Feel anything?
No.
Well, make sure.
Ok, I' m -- I' m pretty sure.
Nothing.
Well, that' s a relief.
Thank you.
Uh, um... no problem.
I wish I could return the favor.
There' s not a lot of breast cancer in the men in my family.
Could check your prostate.
I think I' m OK.
Well, thanks, anyway.
Are we done?
Yeah, we' re done.
See you... around.
Cornelius?
Cornelius!
It' s me...
Bob!
Bob.
We all thought you were dead.
Still here.
How are you, Bob?
Better than I' ve ever been in my whole life.
Really.
You still remaining men together?
Really.
What is it?
Well... first rule is...
And the second rule is,
I' m not supposed to talk about it.
Bob.
Bob.
I' m a member.
Look at my face, Bob.
That' s fuckin '-- That' s fuckin' great.
I' ve never seen you there.
I go Tuesdays and Thursdays.
I go Saturday.
Congratulations.
Hey, to both of us, right?
Have you heard about the guy that invented this thing?
I --
I hear all kinds of things.
And he sleeps only one hour a night.
He' s a great man.
Do you know about Tyler Durden?
I didn' t hurt you, did I?
Actually, you did.
Thank you for this.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Bob.
Bob.
This was mine and Tyler' s gift... our gift to the world.
I see a lot of new faces.
Shut up!
Which means a lot of you have been breaking the first 2 rules of Fight Club.
Man, I see in Fight Club the strongest and smartest men who' ve ever lived.
I see all this potential.
And I see squandering.
God damn it.
An entire generation pumping gas... waiting tables... slaves with white collars.
Advertising has its taste in cars and clothes... working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don' t need.
We' re the middle children of history, man.
No purpose or place.
We have no Great War... no Great Depression.
Our Great War' s a spiritual war.
Our Great Depression is our lives.
We' ve all been raised on television to believe that one day we' d all be millionaires and movie gods and rock stars.
But we won' t.
We' re slowly learning that fact.
And we' re very, very pissed off.
First rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about --
Who are you?
Who am I?
Yeah.
There' s a sign in the front that says "Lou' s Tavern."
I' m fuckin 'Lou.
Who the fuck are you?
Tyler Durden.
Who told you motherfuckers that you could use my place?
Irvin?
Irvin' s at home with a broken collarbone.
He don' t own this place.
How much money is he gettin 'for this?
There is no money.
- Really.
- Free to all.
It is, actually.
Look, stupid fuck...
Hey.
You should join our club.
Did you hear what I just said?
You and your friend.
Uhh!
No, I didn' t quite catch that, Lou.
Still not gettin 'it.
OK, OK, OK.
I got it.
Shit, I lost it.
Ooh!
All of you!
Everybody back.
Aw, Lou...
Come on, man.
We really like this place.
Ohhh...
- That' s right, Lou, get it -- - Shut the fuck up!
Oh, yeah!
Ho ho, ho!
Fuckin 'guys are loony, I' m tellin' ya.
Unbelievable.
- Oh, my God!
- Ha ha ha!
Ha ha!
Please let us keep it, Lou!
Please, Lou!
Christ!
I want your word, Lou!
I want your word!
On my mother' s honor.
Thanks, Lou.
You, too, big guy.
See you next week.
This week... each one of you... has a homework assignment.
You' re gonna start a fight with a total stranger.
And you' re gonna lose.
Excellent choice, sir.
Watch out, jackass!
Come on!
Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.
Son of a bitch!
Most people... normal people... do just about anything to avoid a fight.
Excuse me.
Like that?
That' s not necessary.
Dave!
Go call 911!
Stop it!
Sorry.
We need to talk.
[Door Closes]
Where to begin?
With your constant absenteeism?
With your unpresentable appearance?
You' re up for review.
I am Jack' s... complete lack of surprise.
What?
Let' s pretend.
OK?
Someone informs you that this company installs front seat mounting brackets that never pass collision tests... brake linings that fail after a thousand miles, and fuel injectors that explode and burn people alive.
What then?
Are you threatening me?
No...
Get the fuck outta here.
I have a better solution.
You keep me on the payroll as an outside consultant.
And in exchange for my salary, my job will be never to tell people these things that I know.
I don' t even have to come into the office.
I can do this job from home.
Who -- Who the fuck do you think you are, you crazy little shit?
Security?
I am jack' s smirking revenge.
What the hell are you doing?
Ohh... that hurt.
Why would you do that?
Oh, my God.
Please stop!
What are you doing?
Oh, God, no!
Please!
For some reason, I thought of my first fight with Tyler.
No!
Under and behind and inside, everything this man took for granted... something horrible had been growing.
Now, look.
Give me the paychecks like I asked, and you won' t ever see me again.
And right then, at our most excellent moment together...
Oh... thank God.
Telephone, computer, fax machine, 52 weekly paychecks, and 48 airline flight coupons.
We now had corporate sponsorship.
This is how Tyler and I were able to have Fight Club every night of the week.
Now nobody was the center of Fight Club except the 2 men fighting.
The leader walked through the crowd, out in the darkness.
Tyler was now involved in a class- action lawsuit with the Pressman Hotel over the urine content of their soup.
I am Jack' s wasted life.
There you are, sir.
Tyler dreamed up new homework assignments.
He handed them out in sealed envelopes.
Did you know there' s a Fight Club up in Delaware City?
Yeah, I heard.
There' s one in Penn' s Grove, too.
Bob even found one up in Newcastle.
Yeah.
I thought you did.
Nah.
Stop for a second.
Hey, what are we doing?
Turn around.
What are we doing?
Homework assignment.
Human sacrifice.
Please.
Please tell me that' s not a gun.
What are you doing?
Meet me in the back.
Hey, don' t fuck around.
Meet me in the back.
On a long enough time line, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.
What are you doing?
Hands behind your back.
Give me your wallet.
Raymond K. Hessel, 1320 Southeast Banning, apartment A.
Small, cramped basement apartment, Raymond?
How did you know?
letters instead of numbers.
Raymond... you' re going to die.
Oh, my God, no...
Is that your mom and dad?
Mom and dad are going to have to call up kindly Dr. So- And- So to pick up your dental records.
You want to know why?
- Aw, come on.
- [Crying]
An expired community college student I. D.
What' d you study, Raymond?
S- S- S- Stuff.
Stuff?
Were the midterms hard?
I asked you what you studied.
Biology, mostly.
Why?
I -- I don' t know.
What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel?
The question, Raymond, was what did you want to be?
Jesus!
Veterinarian!
Animals.
Yeah, animal s- s- s --
Yeah, I got that.
That means you have to get more schooling.
Too much school.
Would you rather be dead?
No...
Would you rather die, here, on your knees, in the back of a convenience store?
No...
I' m keeping your license.
Gonna check in on you.
I know where you live.
If you' re not on your way to becoming a veterinarian in 6 weeks, you will be dead.
Now run on home.
Run, Forrest, run!
I feel ill.
Imagine how he feels.
Come on, this isn' t funny!
What the fuck was the point of that?
Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day of Raymond K. Hessel' s life.
His breakfast will taste better than any meal you and I have ever tasted.
You had to give it to him.
Come on.
And it started to make sense in a Tyler sort of way.
No fear.
No distractions.
The ability to let that which does not matter truly slide.
You' re not your job.
You' re not how much money you have in the bank.
You' re not the car you drive.
You' re not the contents of your wallet.
You' re not your fuckin 'khakis.
You' re the all- singing, all- dancing crap of the world.
I' il be out of your way in a sec.
You don' t have to go.
Whatever.
No, I mean, uh...
It' s OK.
Are you still going to groups?
Yeah.
Chloe' s dead.
Ah, Chloe.
When did that happen?
Do you care?
I don' t know.
I haven' t thought about it in a while.
Yeah, well...
I think it was a smart move on her part.
Hey, listen, uh... what are you getting out of all this?
What?
I mean, all this.
Why do you keep...
Is this making you happy?
Yeah, well, sometimes.
I don' t know.
I don' t understand.
Why does a weaker person need to latch on to a strong person?
What is that?
Well, what do you get out of it?
No -- It' s -- It' s not the same thing at all.
It' s totally different with us.
Us?
What do you mean by "us"?
I' m sorry, do you hear this?
Hear what?
You' re not hearing all that noise? just -- Hold on a second.
What were you saying?
I want to talk about this.
No.
What?
That day you came over to my place to play doctor -- what was going on there?
Nothing.
I don' t think so.
Come on, what do you want?
- Look at me.
What?
Look at me.
What is that?
It' s nothing.
Don' t worry about it.
Who did this?
A person.
Guy or girl?
What do you care if it' s a guy or a girl?
This is none of your business.
You' re afraid to say it.
I am not afraid to say.
Let me go.
No!
Talk to me.
Leave me alone.
This conversation...
This conversation... is over. is over.
I just can' t win with you, can I?
Hey, this is getting a little old.
[Doorbell]
What is -- What is all this?
What do you think?
Hey, why do we need bunk beds?
Too young.
Sorry.
What' s all that?
If the applicant is young, tell him he' s too young.
Fat, too fat.
Applicant?
If the applicant then waits for 3 days without food, shelter or encouragement, he may then enter and begin his training.
Training for what?
You think this is a game?
End of story.
Get the fuck out of here.
Bad news, friend.
It' s not gonna happen.
I' m sorry if there was a misunderstanding.
It' s not the end of the world. just go away.
Go.
You' re trespassing, and I will have to call the police.
Don' t you look at me.
You' re never getting in this fucking house.
Never.
Get off the porch!
Sooner or later, we all became what Tyler wanted us to be.
I' m gonna go inside and I' m gonna get a shovel.
Sir.
2 pair of black pants?
Yes, sir.
Sir.
2 pair of black socks?
Sir.
One black jacket?
Sir. $300 personal burial money?
Yes, sir.
All right.
You' re too old, fat man.
Your tits are too big.
Get the fuck off my porch.
Bob.
Like a monkey ready to be shot into space.
Space monkey.
Ready to sacrifice himself for the greater good.
You are too fucking old, fatty!
And you.
You' re too fucking... blond!
Get out of here, the both of you!
Narrator:
Listen up, maggots.
You are not special.
You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake.
You are the same decaying organic matter as everything else.
Tyler built himself an army.
We are the all- singing, all- dancing crap of the world.
We are all part of the same compost heap.
Why was Tyler Durden building an army?
To what purpose?
For what greater good?
In Tyler we trusted.
No, when he was like, "You are not your job," I was like...
Hey, what' s all this?
[Laughing]
OK!
Go on in and celebrate.
What are we celebrating?
Go on.
Hey.
Let me get that for you.
Investigators are on the scene right now.
Police Commissioner Jacobs has just arrived.
Commissioner, Commissioner, could you please tell us what you think has happened here?
We believe this is one of many recent acts of vandalism around the city somehow related to underground boxing clubs.
We' il be coordinating a rigorous investigation.
That was Police Commissioner Jacobs, who just arrived on the scene here of a 4- alarm fire that broke out about an hour ago.
Live from the Parker Morris Building,
Back to you in the studio.
- [Laughter]
- Yeah!
Holy shit.
Yeah!
What the fuck did you guys do?
News Anchor:... how the blaze started, but arson investigators are on the premises...
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem is you do not ask questions, sir.
The victory in the war against crime will not come overnight.
It will take dedication and commitment, and most of all, cooperation.
The streets are safer now.
There is hope in the inner city.
However, this is only the beginning.
These are the first steps in a long journey.
That is why we have created Project Hope...
Project Hope will be a joint effort between the police and community leaders.
It will be a powerful new weapon in the war against crime.
Wrap it around the top of his hacky sack, Bob.
His balls are ice cold.
Hi.
You' re gonna call off your rigorous investigation.
You' re gonna publicly state that there is no underground group, or... these guys are gonna take your balls.
They' re gonna send one to the New York Times, one to the L. A. Times press release style.
Look... the people you are after are the people you depend on.
We cook your meals.
We connect your calls.
We drive your ambulances.
We guard you while you sleep.
Do not fuck with us.
Fooled ya.
[Dialogue Drowned Out By Noise]
Let' s go.
I am Jack' s inflamed sense of rejection.
Hey!
Yeah!
I felt like putting a bullet between the eyes of every panda that wouldn' t screw to save its species.
I' d never see.
I wanted to breathe smoke.
Where' d you go, psycho boy?
I felt like destroying something beautiful.
Get him to a fuckin 'hospital.
Yeah.
Don' t worry, Mr. Durden.
Airport parking, long term.
After you, Mr. Durden.
After you.
Something on your mind, dear?
No.
Why wasn' t I told about Project Mayhem?
First rule of Project Mayhem is you do not ask questions.
Why didn' t you include me in the beginning?
Fight Club was the beginning.
Now it' s moved out of the basement, it' s called Project Mayhem.
Do you remember that?
It' s as much mine as it is yours, you know.
Yeah.
I thought we were doing this together.
This does not belong to us.
We are not special.
You should' ve told me.
Hey, Tyler!
Goddamn it, Tyler!
Statement of purpose?
Should I e- mail you?
Should I put this on your action item list?
You decide your own level of involvement!
I want to know certain things first.
The first rule of Project Mayhem --
Shut up!
Fuck what you know.
That' s your problem.
Forget about what you think you know about life, about friendship, and especially about you and me.
What...
What are you doing?
Guys, what do you wish you' d done before you die?
Paint a self- portrait.
Build a house.
And you?
I don' t know.
Get in the right lane.
I have to know the answer to this question.
If you were to die right now, how would you feel about your life?
I wouldn' t feel anything good about my life.
Is that what you want to hear me say?
- Come on!
- [Honking]
- Stop fucking around!
Tyler!
Jesus Christ!
Goddamn it!
Goddamn it!
Fuck Fight Club.
I' m sick of all your shit.
OK.
Quit screwing around.
Take the wheel.
Look at you.
Take the wheel!
You' re fuckin 'pathetic!
Why?
What are you talking about?
Why do you think I blew up your condo?
What?
Hitting bottom isn' t a weekend retreat.
It' s not a goddamn seminar.
Stop trying to control everything and just let go.
Let go!
All right.
Fine.
Fine.
I' d never been in a car accident.
This must have been what all those people felt like before I filed them as statistics in my reports.
Goddamn.
We just had a near- life experience.
In the world I see, you' re stalking elk through the damp canyon forest, around the ruins of Rockefeller Center.
You' il wear leather clothes that will last you the rest of your life.
You' il climb the vines that wrap the Sears Tower.
laying strips of venison on the empty carpool lane of some abandoned superhighway.
Feel better, champ.
Narrator:
Tyler was gone.
Was I asleep?
Had I slept?
You are not a beautiful unique snowflake, do you understand me?
Narrator:
The house had become a living thing, wet inside from so many people sweating and breathing.
So many people moving, the house moved.
Planet Tyler.
I had to hug the walls.
Trapped inside this clockwork of space monkeys.
You can' t be smoking in here.
Do you know how much ether we have in this fucking house?
Cooking, working, and sleeping in teams.
Hang on a second.
It' s under control, sir.
Where is Tyler?
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem is you do not --
Right, uh...
I' m all alone.
My father dumped me.
Tyler dumped me.
I am Jack' s broken heart.
What comes next in Project Mayhem, only Tyler knows.
The second rule is you do not ask questions.
Get the fuck away from me.
Get the fuck away from me!
Who are all these people?
Paper Street Soap Company.
Can I come in?
He' s not here.
What?
Tyler isn' t here.
Tyler went away.
Tyler' s gone.
[Shouting]
Gunshot wounds comin 'through!
Clear some fucking room!
What happened?!
We were on assignment.
We were supposed to kill 2 birds with one stone.
Destroy a piece of corporate art...
Operation Latté Thunder, go.
and trash a franchise coffee bar.
We had it all worked out, sir.
Police!
Freeze!
Until what?
They shot him in the head.
Those fuckin 'pigs!
- Son of a --
Those motherfuckers!
You morons.
You' re running around in ski masks, trying to blow things up.
What did you think was gonna happen?!
OK, quick, we gotta get rid of the evidence.
Bury him.
What?
Take him to the garden and bury him.
Come on, people!
Let' s go!
Hey, get the fuck off!.
What are you talking about?
This isn' t a fucking piece of evidence, this is a person!
He' s a friend of mine, and you' re not gonna bury him in the fucking garden.
He was killed serving Project Mayhem, sir.
This is Bob.
But sir, in -- in Project Mayhem we have no names.
And it' s Robert Paulson, OK?
Robert Paulson?
He' s a man and he' s dead now because of us, all right?
I understand.
In death, a member of Project Mayhem has a name.
His name is Robert Paulson.
His name is Robert Paulson.
His name is Robert Paulson.
His name is Robert Paulson.
Come on, guys, please, stop it.
His name is Robert Paulson.
Shut up!
This is all over with!
His name is Robert Paulson.
[Telephone Rings]
No, this is Detective Stern at the Arson Unit.
I need to see you in my office --
I went to all the cities on Tyler' s used ticket stubs, barhopping.
I didn' t know how or why, but I could look at 50 different bars and somehow I just knew.
It' s very important that I talk to him.
Sir.
Every city I went to... as soon as I set foot off the plane,
Hey!
Taxi!
Look at my face.
I' m a member.
Now, I just need to know if you' ve seen Tyler.
I' m not exposed to... speak any such information to you, nor would I, even if I had said information you want at this juncture, be able.
You' re a moron.
Setting up franchises all over the country.
Was I asleep?
Had I slept?
Is Tyler my bad dream, or am I Tyler' s?
What kind of stories?
Like, nobody knows what he looks like.
He has facial reconstructive surgery every 3 years.
That' s the stupidest thing I' ve ever heard.
Is it true about Fight Club in Miami?
Is Mr. Durden building an army?
I was living in a state of perpetual déjà vu.
I felt I' d already been there.
It was like following an invisible man.
The smell of dried blood, dirty, bare footprints circling each other, that aroma of old sweat, like fried chicken.
The feel of a floor still warm from the fight the night before.
I was always just one step behind Tyler.
His name is Robert Paulson.
Welcome back, sir.
How have you been?
Do you know me?
Is this a test, sir?
No, this is not a test.
You were in here last Thursday.
You were standing exactly where you are now, asking how good security is.
It' s tight as a drum, sir.
Who do you think I am?
Are you sure this isn' t a test?
No, this is not a test.
You' re Mr. Durden.
You' re the one who gave me this.
Please return your seat backs to their full, upright and locked position.
[Rings]
Marla, it' s me.
Have we ever done it?
Done what?
Have we ever had sex?
What kind of stupid question is that?
Is it stupid because the answer' s yes, or because the answer' s no?
Is this a trick?
No, Marla, I need to know --
You mean you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
We did make love.
Is that what you' re calling it? just answer the question,
Marla, please!
You fuck me, then snub me.
You love me, you hate me.
You show me a sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole.
Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler?
We have just lost cabin pressure.
What is wrong with you?
What did you call me?
Tyler Durden.
Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.
I' m coming over.
No, wait, Marla, I' m not there --
You broke your promise.
Jesus, Tyler.
You fuckin 'talked to her about me.
Tyler, what the fuck is going on here?
I asked you for one thing, one simple thing.
Why do people think that I' m you?
Answer me!
Sit.
Now answer me.
Why do people think that I' m you?
I think you know.
No, I don' t.
Yes, you do.
Why would anyone possibly confuse you with me?
I...
You got it.
No.
Do not fuck with us.
Say it.
Because...
Say it.
Because we' re the same person.
That' s right.
We are the all- singing, all dancing --
I don' t understand this.
You were looking for a way to change your life.
You could not do this on your own.
All the ways you wish you could be, that' s me.
I fuck like you wanna fuck,
I am smart, capable, and most importantly, I am free in all the ways that you are not.
Oh, no.
Tyler' s not here.
- Tyler' s gone.
- What?
This is impossible.
- No.
People do it every day.
They talk to themselves.
They see themselves as they' d like to be.
They don' t have the courage you have, to just run with it.
Naturally, you' re still wrestling with it, so sometimes you' re still you.
We should do this again sometime.
Other times, you imagine yourself watching me.
If this is your first night at Fight Club, you have to fight.
Little by little, you' re just letting yourself become...
Tyler Durden.
You are not your job, or how much money you have in the bank!
No, you have a house.
Rented in your name.
You have jobs, you have a whole life.
You have night jobs because you can' t sleep.
Or you stay up and make soap.
Marla -- You' re fucking Marla, Tyler.
But it' s all the same to her.
Oh, my God.
Now you see our dilemma.
She knows too much.
I think we' re going to have to talk about how this might compromise our goals.
Wh -- What are you saying?
This is -- This is bullshit.
I' m not listening to this.
You are insane.
No, you' re insane.
And we simply do not have time for this crap.
It' s called a changeover.
The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea.
Woman:
Sir!
Are you checking out?
Yeah, uh, b- bill me.
I need you to initial this list of phone calls, please.
When were these made?
Have I been going to bed earlier every night?
Have I been sleeping later?
Have I been Tyler longer and longer?
Is anybody here?
Déjà vu all over again.
Yeah, with enough soap, we could blow up just about anything.
Oh, my God.
Man On Telephone:
I' m sorry, who am I calling?
This is Maintenance.
Hello?
Yes.
Can I help you?
Hello?
Uh, I need to talk to your supervisor right away.
Speaking.
OK, listen to me.
You have got --
It' s under control, sir.
Excuse me?
Don' t worry about us, sir.
2160.
Marla!
Marla!
Hey -- Fuck!
Wait, I gotta talk to you!
Marla, Marla!
Your whacked- out bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom!
They were burning their fingertips with lye, the stink was unbelievable.
Look -- Look, listen, it' s gonna take a tremendous act of faith on your part, but you' ve got to hear me out.
Oh, here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
A little more faith than that.
No, listen, I don' t want to hear anything you have to say.
You have every right to be...
Um, I' il just have a coffee, thanks.
Sir, anything you order is free of charge, sir.
Why is it free of charge?
Don' t -- Don' t ask.
Whatever.
I' il have the clam chowder, the fried chicken with the baked potato with everything, and a chocolate chiffon pie.
Clean food, please.
In that case, sir, may I advise against the lady eating the clam chowder?
No clam chowder, thank you.
You' ve got about 30 seconds.
Marla, I know that I' ve been acting very, very strange.
OK, I know that it' s got to seem
like there' s 2 sides to me -- 2 sides?
You' re Dr. Jekyil and Mr. Jackass.
I' ve come to realize something very, very important.
What?
The full extent of our relationship wasn' t really clear to me up until now, for reasons I' m not going to go into, but the important thing is, I know that I haven' t been treating you so nice.
Yeah, whatever.
15 seconds, please, please.
15 seconds, don' t open your mouth.
I' m trying to tell you that I' m sorry.
Because what I' ve come to realize is that I really like you, Marla.
You do?
I really do.
I care about you and I don' t want anything bad to happen to you because of me.
Marla, your life is in danger.
What?
You need to leave town for a while.
Get out of any major city and just go camping or something.
You' re an insane person.
No, no, I' ve involved you in something terrible that' s about to happen.
No.
Shut up, shut up!
Listen, I tried, Tyler.
I know you did.
There are things about you I like.
You' re smart, you' re funny, you' re spectacular in bed.
But you' re intolerable.
You have very serious emotional problems.
Deep- seated problems for which you should seek professional help.
I know, and I' m sorry.
But...
I can' t do this anymore.
I can' t.
And I won' t.
I' m gone.
You can' t leave, Marla, you' re not safe!
No!
Marla, I' m trying to protect you.
I don' t ever want to see you again!
That' s fine, if that' s what it takes...
Wait right here.
Hold it right there.
- Shut up!
Take this money and get on this bus.
And I promise you
- [Honks]
Please get on the bus!
Why are you doing this?
Because they think you' re some kind of a threat.
I -- I can' t explain it right now, just trust me.
If I see where you' re going, you will not be safe.
I consider it asshole tax.
That' s fine.
Remember, stay out of major cities for at least a couple of days, OK?
Tyler.
You' re the worst thing that ever happened to me.
Hello.
I need you to arrest me.
I am the leader of a terrorist organization responsible for numerous acts of vandalism, and assault all over this city.
... in the metropolitan area, with probably a couple hundred members.
Chapters have sprung up in 5 or 6 other major cities already.
This is a tightly regimented organization, with many cells capable of operating completely independent of central leadership.
Look, look, go to that house, OK?
1537 Paper Street.
That' s our headquarters.
In the back, buried in the garden, you' il find the body of Robert Paulson.
In the basement, you' re gonna find some bathtubs that have been used very recently to make large quantities of nitroglycerin.
I believe the plan is to blow up the headquarters of these credit card companies, and the T. R. W. building.
Why these buildings?
Why credit card companies?
If you erase the debt record, then we all go back to zero.
It' il create total chaos.
Keep him talking.
I need to make a phone call.
I really admire what you' re doing.
What?
You' re a brave man to order this.
You' re a genius, sir.
You said, if anyone ever interferes with Project Mayhem -- even you -- we gotta get his balls.
It' s useless to fight.
Mr. Durden.
It' il set quite an example.
You' re making a big mistake, fellas.
You said you' d say that.
I' m not Tyler Durden!
You told us you' d say that, too.
All right, I am Tyler Durden.
I' m giving you a direct order.
We are aborting this mission, right now.
You said you would definitely say that.
You' re police officers!
Somebody timing this?
Keep your mouth shut!
Shit.
Hey, you know, some of this information checks out.
Let' s go over to that house on Paper Street.
Hey!
I got him.
Sir, we have to do this, sir.
Stop fighting.
Where' s the rubber band?
Get away from me!
Drop that fucking knife!
Back up.
Face down on the floor, both of you, right now!
Get down on the floor!
First person comes out this fucking door gets a -- gets a lead salad, you understand?
Get away!
I ran.
I ran until my muscles burned and my veins pumped battery acid.
Then I ran some more.
What the fuck are you doing?
Running around in your underpants.
Man, you look like a crazy person.
No, I' m onto you.
I know what' s going on here.
Well come on, then.
[Grunting]
It' il be like pay- per- view.
Oh, Christ.
I' m stopping this.
Why?
Greatest thing you' ve ever done, man.
No, I can' t let this happen.
You know there are 10 other bombs in 10 other buildings.
God damn it, since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
The buildings are empty.
Security and maintenance, all our people.
We' re not killing anyone, man, we' re setting 'em free.
They shot him in the head.
You wanna make an omelet, you gotta break some eggs.
No, I' m not listening to you.
You' re not even there.
Wouldn' t do that.
Not unless I knew which wires were what.
If you know, then I know.
Or... maybe I knew you' d know, so I spent the whole day thinking about the wrong ones.
You think?
Oh, heavens no, not the green one.
Pull any one but the green one.
I asked you not to do that!
Tyler, get away from the van.
Tyler, I' m not kidding!
Get away from the van!
God damn it!
Whoa!
Whoa!
OK, you are now firing a gun at your imaginary friend near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin!
Look, Tyler, Tyler!
Aw, come on.
Don' t go.
What?!
3 minutes.
This is it.
The beginning.
Ground zero.
I think this is about where we came in.
Would you like to say a few words to mark the occasion?
I' m sorry?
I still can' t think of anything.
Ah, flashback humor.
It' s getting exciting now.
2 and 1/ 2.
Think of everything we' ve accomplished, man.
Out these windows, we will view the collapse of financial history.
One step closer to economic equilibrium.
Why is she here?
Tying up loose ends.
Put me down, you bald- headed fucks!
I' m begging you, please don' t do this.
I' m not doing this.
We are doing this.
This is what we want.
No, I don' t want this.
Right, except you is meaningless now.
We have to forget about you.
Jesus, you' re a voice in my head.
You' re a voice in mine.
You' re a fucking hallucination, why can' t I get rid of you?
You need me.
No, I don' t, I really don' t anymore.
Hey, you created me.
I didn' t create some loser alter ego to make myself feel better.
Take some responsibility.
I am responsible for all of it, and I accept that.
So please, I' m begging you, please call this off.
Have I ever let us down?
How far have you come because of me?
I will bring us through this.
I will carry you, kicking and screaming, and in the end, you will thank me.
Tyler.
Tyler, I' m grateful to you for everything that you' ve done for me.
But this is too much.
I don' t want this.
What do you want?!
Want to go back to the shit job, fucking condo world, watching sitcoms?
Fuck you.
I won' t do it.
Oh, God, this can' t be happening.
It' s already done, so shut up.
60 seconds.
Can you see alright?
I can figure this out.
I can figure this out, this isn' t even real.
You' re not real, that gun isn' t --
That gun isn' t even in your hand.
The gun' s in my hand.
Hey, good for you.
Doesn' t change a thing.
Why do you want to put a gun to your head?
Not my head, Tyler.
Our head.
Interesting.
Where are you going with this, IKEA boy?
Hey, it' s you and me.
Friends.
Tyler...
I want you to really listen to me.
OK.
My eyes are open.
What' s that smell?
Where is everybody?
I don' t know, what' s goin 'on?
Mr. Durden!
Oh, my God.
Are you, uh...
Are you alright, sir?
Oh, yeah, I' m OK.
You look terrible, sir.
What happened?
It' s no problem.
Oh, no, no, sir, he' s not kidding.
You look really awful.
You need medical assistance.
Look, I' m fine.
Everything' s fine.
[Marla Shouting]
Let -- Let her go.
Christ almighty!
You!
Hi, Marla.
Leave her with me, get your stuff,
Are you sure?
Yes, I' m sure.
You fucker!
What kind of sick fucking game are you playing now, putting me on a fucking bu --
Oh, my God, your face!
Yeah, I know.
What happened?
Don' t ask.
You' re shot.
Yes, I' m shot.
Oh, my God.
I can' t believe he' s standing.
One tough motherfucker.
Who did this?
I did, actually.
Find some gauze.
You shot yourself?
Yes, but it' s OK.
Marla, look at me.
I' m really OK.
Trust me.
Everything' s gonna be fine.
You met me at a very strange time in my life.
The world is changed.
I feel it in the water.
I feel it in the earth.
I smell it in the air.
Much that once was...... is lost.
For none now live who remember it.
It began with the forging of the Great Rings.
Three were given to the Elves.:
Immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings.
Seven to the Dwarf- lords:
Great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls.
And nine...... nine rings were gifted to the race of Men...... who, above all else, desire power.
For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race.
But they were all of them deceived.
For another ring was made.
In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom...... the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a Master Ring...... to control all others.
And into this Ring he poured his cruelty, his malice...... and his will to dominate all life.
One Ring to rule them all.
One by one...... the Free Lands of Middle- earth fell to the power of the Ring.
But there were some who resisted.
A Last Alliance of Men and Elves marched against the armies of Mordor.
And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle- earth.
Victory was near.
But the power of the Ring...... could not be undone.
It was in this moment...... when all hope had faded...... that Isildur, son of the king, took up his father' s sword.
Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples of Middle- earth, was defeated.
The Ring passed to Isildur...... who had this one chance to destroy evil forever.
But the hearts of Men...... are easily corrupted.
And the Ring of Power has a will of its own.
It betrayed Isildur...... to his death.
And some things that should not have been forgotten...... were lost.
History became legend...... legend became myth.
And for two and a half thousand years...... the Ring passed out of all knowledge.
Until, when chance came...... it ensnared a new bearer.
My precious.
The Ring came to the creature Gollum...... who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains.
And there it consumed him.
It came to me.
My own.
My love.
My own.
My precious.
The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life.
For 500 years it poisoned his mind.
And in the gloom of Gollum' s cave, it waited.
Darkness crept back into the forests of the world.
Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...... whispers of a nameless fear.
And the Ring of Power perceived...... its time had now come.
It abandoned Gollum.
But something happened then the Ring did not intend.
It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable.
What' s this?
A Hobbit.
Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.
A ring.
Lost!
My precious is lost!
For the time will soon come...... when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.
The 22nd day of September...... in the year 1400...... by Shire- reckoning.
Bag End, Bagshot Row, Hobbiton, West farthing...... the Shire...... Middle- earth.
The Third Age of this world.
There and Back Again:
A Hobbit' s Tale.
By Bilbo Baggins.
Now...... where to begin?
Ah, yes....
"Concerning...... Hobbits."
Hobbits have been living and farming in the four Farthings of the Shire...... for many hundreds of years...... quite content to ignore and be ignored...... by the world of the Big Folk.
Middle- earth being, after all, full of strange creatures beyond count...... Hobbits must seem of little importance...... being neither renowned as great warriors...... nor counted among the very wise.
Frodo!
Someone at the door.
In fact, it has been remarked by some...... that Hobbits' only real passion is for food.
A rather unfair observation...... as we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of ales...... and the smoking of pipe- weed.
But where our hearts truly lie...... is in peace and quiet...... and good, tilled earth.
For all Hobbits share a love of things that grow.
And, yes, no doubt to others, our ways seem quaint.
But today of all days, it is brought home to me.:
It is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.
Frodo, the door!
Sticklebacks.
Where is that boy?
Frodo!
Down from the door where it began
The road goes ever on and on
Now far ahead the road has gone
- And I must follow if I can - You' re late.
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.
Nor is he early.
He arrives precisely when he means to.
It' s wonderful to see you, Gandalf!
You didn' t think I' d miss your Uncle Bilbo' s birthday?
How is the old rascal?
I hear it' s going to be a party of special magnificence.
You know Bilbo.
He' s got the whole place in an uproar.
Well, that should please him.
Half the Shire' s been invited.
And the rest of them are turning up anyway.
If it comes at all.
For things are made to endure in the Shire...... passing from one generation to the next.
There' s always been a Baggins living here under the Hill...... in Bag End.
And there always will be.
To tell you the truth, Bilbo' s been a bit odd lately.
I mean, more than usual.
He' s taken to locking himself in his study.
He spends hours poring over old maps when he thinks I' m not looking.
Where' s it gone?
He' s up to something.
- All right, then.
Keep your secrets.
- What?
But I know you have something to do with it.
Good gracious me.
Before you came along, we Bagginses were very well thought of.
Indeed.
Never had any adventures or did anything unexpected.
If you' re referring to the incident with the dragon, I was barely involved.
All I did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the door.
Whatever you did, you' ve been officially labeled a disturber of the peace.
Oh, really?
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
Fireworks, Gandalf!
- Gandalf!
- Fireworks, Gandalf!
Gandalf?
- I' m glad you' re back.
- So am I, dear boy.
So am I.
No, thank you!
We don' t want any more visitors, well- wishers or distant relations!
And what about very old friends?
Gandalf?
- Bilbo Baggins.
- My dear Gandalf!
Good to see you.
Who would believe it?
You haven' t aged a day.
Come on, come in!
Welcome, welcome.
Oh, here we are.
Tea?
Or maybe something a little stronger?
I' ve got a few bottles of the Old Winyard left.
1296.
Very good year.
Almost as old as I am.
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?
Just tea, thank you.
I was expecting you sometime last week.
You come and go as you please.
Always have and always will.
You caught me a bit unprepared.
We' ve only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle....
There' s some cheese here.
No, that won' t do.
We' ve got raspberry jam, an apple tart....
But not much for afters.
Oh, no, we' re all right.
I' ve just found some sponge cake.
I could make you some eggs if you' d --
- Just tea, thank you.
- Oh, right.
- You don' t mind if I eat, do you?
- No, not at all.
Bilbo Baggins!
I' m not at home!
It' s the Sackville- Bagginses.
- I know you' re in there!
- They' re after the house.
They' ve never forgiven me for living this long.
I' ve got to get away from these confounded relatives, hanging on the bell all day...... never giving me a moment' s peace.
Mountains, Gandalf!
And then find somewhere quiet where I can finish my book.
Oh, tea.
- Yes, yes.
It' s all in hand.
All the arrangements are made.
Oh, thank you.
Frodo suspects something.
Of course he does.
He' s a Baggins...... not some blockheaded Bracegirdle from Hardbottle.
You will tell him, won' t you?
- Yes, yes.
- He' s very fond of you.
I know.
He' d probably come with me if I asked him.
I think in his heart, Frodo' s still in love with the Shire.
The woods, the fields.
Little rivers.
I am old, Gandalf.
I know I don' t look it, but I' m beginning to feel it in my heart.
I feel thin.
Sort of stretched...... like butter scraped over too much bread.
I need a holiday.
A very long holiday.
And I don' t expect I shall return.
In fact, I mean not to.
Old Toby.
The finest weed in the South farthing.
Gandalf, my old friend...... this will be a night to remember.
Hello, hello.
Fatty Bolger.
Lovely to see you.
Welcome, welcome.
Go on, Sam.
Ask Rosie for a dance.
- I think I' il just have another ale.
- Oh, no, you don' t.
Go on!
So there I was...... at the mercy of three monstrous trolls.
And they were all arguing amongst themselves...... about how they were going to cook us.
Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit on us one by one, squash us into jelly.
They spent so much time arguing the whithertos and the whyfors...... that the sun' s first light crept over the top of the trees...... and turned them all to stone!
Quickly.
Up they go!
No, the big one.
Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you.
Welcome, welcome.
Are all these children yours?
Good gracious, you have been productive.
Bilbo?
Sackville- Bagginses!
Quickly, hide!
Thank you, my boy.
You' re a good lad, Frodo.
I' m very selfish, you know.
Yes, I am.
Very selfish.
I don' t know why I took you in after your mother and father died...... but it wasn' t out of charity.
I think it was because...... of all my numerous relations...... you were the one Baggins that showed real spirit.
Bilbo, have you been at the Gaffer' s home brew?
No.
Well, yes, but that' s not the point.
The point is, Frodo...
... you' il be all right.
- Done!
- You' re supposed to stick it in the ground.
- It is in the ground.
- Outside!
This was your idea.
Bilbo.
Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!
Nonsense.
There hasn' t been a dragon in these parts for a thousand years.
- That was good.
- Let' s get another one.
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.
I might' ve known.
Speech, Bilbo!
Speech!
Speech!
My dear Bagginses and Boffins...... Tooks and Brandybucks...... Grubbs, Chubbs...... Hornblowers...... Bolgers...... Bracegirdles...
-... and Proudfoots.
- Proudfeet!
Today is my 111th birthday!
Happy birthday!
But alas, eleventy- one years is far too short a time to live among...... such excellent and admirable Hobbits.
I don' t know half of you half as well as I should like...... and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve.
I have things to do.
I' ve put this off far too long.
I regret to announce this is the end!
I' m going now.
I bid you all a very fond farewell.
Goodbye.
I suppose you think that was terribly clever.
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?
There are many magic rings in this world, and none of them should be used lightly.
It was just a bit of fun.
Oh, you' re probably right, as usual.
- You will keep an eye on Frodo, won' t you?
As often as I can spare them.
- I' m leaving everything to him.
- What about this ring of yours?
- Is that staying too?
- Yes, yes.
It' s in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece.
No.
Wait, it' s...... here in my pocket.
Isn' t that odd, now?
Yet, after all, why not?
- Why shouldn' t I keep it?
- I think you should leave the ring behind.
Is that so hard?
Well, no.
And yes.
Now it comes to it, I don' t feel like parting with it.
It' s mine.
It came to me!
- There' s no need to get angry.
- Well, if I' m angry, it' s your fault!
It' s mine.
My own.
- My precious.
- Precious?
It' s been called that before, but not by you.
What business is it of yours what I do with my own things?
I think you' ve had that ring quite long enough.
- You want it for yourself!
- Bilbo Baggins!
Do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks.
I am not trying to rob you.
I' m trying to help you.
All your long years, we' ve been friends.
Trust me as you once did.
Let it go.
You' re right, Gandalf.
The ring must go to Frodo.
It' s late.
The road is long.
Yes, it is time.
Bilbo, the ring is still in your pocket.
I' ve thought up an ending for my book:
"And he lived happily ever after to the end of his days."
And I' m sure you will, my dear friend.
Goodbye, Gandalf.
Goodbye, dear Bilbo.
The road goes ever on and on
Until our next meeting.
It' s mine.
My own.
My precious.
Riddles in the dark.
Bilbo!
Bilbo!
My precious.
Precious.
He' s gone, hasn' t he?
He talked for so long about leaving...... I didn' t think he' d really do it.
Gandalf?
Bilbo' s ring.
He' s gone to stay with the Elves.
He' s left you Bag End.
Along with all his possessions.
The ring is yours now.
- Put it somewhere out of sight.
- Where are you going?
- There are some things that I must see to.
- What things?
- Questions.
Questions that need answering.
- You' ve only just arrived.
I don' t understand.
Neither do I.
Keep it secret.
Keep it safe.
Shire!
Baggins!
"The year 3434 of the Second Age.
Here follows the account of Isildur, High King of Gondor...... and the finding of the Ring of Power. "
"It has come to me.
The One Ring.
It shall be an heirloom of my kingdom.
All those who follow in my bloodline shall be bound to its fate...... for I will risk no hurt to the Ring.
It is precious to me...... though I buy it with great pain.
The markings upon the band begin to fade.
The writing, which at first was as clear as red flame, has all but disappeared.
A secret now that only fire can tell. "
Shire.
Baggins.
There' s no Bagginses around here.
They' re all up in Hobbiton.
That way.
To heal my heart and drown my woe
Rain may fall and wind may blow
But there still be
Many miles to go
Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain
And the stream that falls From hill to plain
Better than rain or rippling brook
Is a mug of beer inside this Took
There' s been some strange folk crossing the Shire.
Dwarves and others of a less than savory nature.
War is brewing.
The mountains are fair teeming with goblins.
Far- off tales and children' s stories, that' s all that is.
You' re beginning to sound like that old Bilbo Baggins.
Cracked, he was.
Young Mr. Frodo here, he' s cracking.
And proud of it.
- Cheers, Gaffer.
- Cheers.
It' s none of our concern what goes on beyond our borders.
Keep your nose out of trouble, and no trouble' il come to you.
- Good night, lads.
- Good night.
Good night, sweet maiden of the golden ale.
Mind who you' re sweet- talking.
Don' t worry, Sam.
Rosie knows an idiot when she sees one.
Does she?
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night, Mister Frodo.
Is it safe?
What are you doing?
Hold out your hand, Frodo.
It' s quite cool.
What can you see?
Can you see anything?
Nothing.
There' s nothing.
Wait.
There are markings.
It' s some form of Elvish.
I can' t read it.
There are few who can.
The language is that of Mordor, which I will not utter here.
Mordor!
In the common tongue, it says:
"One Ring to rule them all...... One Ring to find them...... One Ring to bring them all...... and in the darkness bind them."
This is the One Ring...... forged by the Dark Lord Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom.
Taken by Isildur from the hand of Sauron himself.
Bilbo found it.
- In Gollum' s cave.
- Yes.
For 60 years, the Ring lay quiet in Bilbo' s keeping...... prolonging his life, delaying old age.
But no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor.
The Ring has awoken.
It' s heard its master' s call.
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.
No, Frodo.
The spirit of Sauron endured.
His life force is bound to the Ring, and the Ring survived.
Sauron has returned.
His Orcs have multiplied.
His fortress at Barad- dur is rebuilt in the land of Mordor.
Sauron needs only this Ring to cover all the lands in a second darkness.
He is seeking it.
All his thought is bent on it.
For the Ring yearns above all else...... to return to the hand of its master.
They are one...... the Ring and the Dark Lord.
Frodo...... he must never find it.
All right.
We put it away.
We never speak of it again.
No one knows it' s here, do they?
Do they, Gandalf?
There is one other who knew that Bilbo had the Ring.
I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum.
But the enemy found him first.
I don' t know how long they tortured him.
But amidst the endless screams and inane babble, they discerned two words:
Shire!
Baggins!
Shire.
Baggins.
But that would lead them here!
Who goes there?
Take it, Gandalf!
- Take it!
- You must take it!
- You cannot offer me this ring!
- I' m giving it to you!
- Don' t tempt me, Frodo!
I dare not take it.
Not even to keep it safe.
Understand, Frodo...... I would use this Ring from a desire to do good.
But through me, it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine.
- But it cannot stay in the Shire!
No, it can' t.
What must I do?
And leave quickly.
Where do I go?
Get out of the Shire.
Make for the village of Bree.
Bree.
- What about you?
- I' il be waiting for you...... at the inn of the Prancing Pony.
- And the Ring will be safe there?
- I don' t know, Frodo.
I don' t have any answers.
Trust me, Frodo.
He' il know what to do.
You' il have to leave the name of Baggins behind you.
That name is not safe outside the Shire.
Travel only by day.
And stay off the road.
I can cut across country easily enough.
My dear Frodo.
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.
You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month.
And yet, after a hundred years...... they can still surprise you.
Get down.
Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee!
Have you been eavesdropping?
I haven' t been dropping no eaves.
I was cutting the grass under the window.
A little late for trimming the verge, don' t you think?
- I heard raised voices.
- What did you hear?
Speak!
Nothing important.
That is, I heard a good deal about a ring, a Dark Lord and the end of the world but --
Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don' t hurt me.
Don' t turn me into anything unnatural.
No?
Perhaps not.
I' ve thought of a better use for you.
Come along, Samwise.
Be careful, both of you.
The enemy has many spies in his service:
Birds, beasts.
Is it safe?
Never put it on...... for the agents of the Dark Lord will be drawn to its power.
Always remember, Frodo...... the Ring is trying to get back to its master.
It wants to be found.
This is it.
This is what?
If I take one more step...... it' il be the farthest away from home I' ve ever been.
Come on, Sam.
Remember what Bilbo used to say:
- "It' s a dangerous business, Frodo."
- "Going out your door.
You step onto the road, and if you don' t keep your feet...... there' s no knowing where you might be swept off to. "
Sam.
Wood- elves.
They' re going to the harbor beyond the White Towers.
To the Grey Havens.
They' re leaving Middle- earth.
Never to return.
I don' t know why...... it makes me sad.
Everywhere I lie there' s a dirty great root sticking into my back.
Just shut your eyes...... and imagine you' re back in your own bed...... with a soft mattress and a lovely feather pillow.
It' s not working, Mr. Frodo.
I' m never going to be able to sleep out here.
Me neither, Sam.
Smoke rises from the Mountain of Doom.
The hour grows late.
And Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard...... seeking my counsel.
For that is why you have come, is it not?
My old friend.
Saruman.
- You are sure of this?
- Beyond any doubt.
So the Ring of Power has been found.
All these long years, it was in the Shire.
- Under my very nose.
- Yet you did not have the wit to see it.
Your love of the halfling' s leaf has clearly slowed your mind.
Time enough to counter Sauron if we act quickly.
Time?
What time do you think we have?
Sauron has regained much of his former strength.
He cannot yet take physical form...... but his spirit has lost none of its potency.
Concealed within his fortress, the Lord of Mordor sees all.
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth and flesh.
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.
A Great Eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.
The Eye of Sauron.
He is gathering all evil to him.
Very soon, he' il have summoned an army...... great enough for an assault upon Middle- earth.
You know this?
How?
I have seen it.
A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman.
Why?
Why should we fear to use it?
They are not all accounted for, the lost Seeing- stones.
We do not know who else may be watching.
The hour is later than you think.
Sauron' s forces are already moving.
The Nine have left Minas Morgul.
The Nine?
They crossed the River Isen on Midsummer' s Eve...... disguised as riders in black.
- They' ve reached the Shire?
- They will find the Ring.
And kill the one who carries it.
Frodo!
You did not seriously think that a Hobbit could contend with the will of Sauron?
There are none who can.
Against the power of Mordor...... there can be no victory.
We must join with him, Gandalf.
We must join with Sauron.
It would be wise, my friend.
Tell me...... friend...... when did Saruman the Wise abandon reason for madness?
I gave you the chance...... of aiding me willingly...... but you have elected the way of pain!
Mr. Frodo?
Frodo?
Frodo!
- I thought I' d lost you.
- What are you talking about?
- It' s just something Gandalf said.
- What did he say?
"Don' t you lose him, Samwise Gamgee."
And I don' t mean to.
Sam, we' re still in the Shire.
What could possibly happen?
Frodo.
- Merry, it' s Frodo Baggins.
- Hello, Frodo.
Get off him.
Come on, Frodo.
What' s the meaning of this?
You' ve been into Farmer Maggot' s crop!
You get back here!
Get out of my field!
You' il know the devil if I catch up with you!
It' s only a couple of carrots.
And some cabbages.
And those three bags of potatoes that we lifted last week.
- And then the mushrooms the week before.
- Yes, Pippin.
My lord, it' s time, you have to leave.
They will have you arrested.
Bring me some candles, I' m working late tonight.
But, my lord..
- And a glass of wine, as usual.
The world had no choice but to change..... but the revolution has become terror and me myself will be taken with away.
The certainties make people blind and mad.
They can tear their hearts apart and make a beast of themselves.
In the year 1764...... the Beast appeared on our grounds and made it his.
One year later it was known far beyond our region...... and people began to think nobody could ever defeat it.
By his attacks the Gevaudan sunk deeper and deeper into the darkness.
Stop...
Who are you?
What did he do?
- He' s a thief.
And she?
A witch.
I healed their horses and they refuse to pay.
A word has no meaning here.
- Yes.
Go on.
Welcome in the land of the Beast.
And watch out for wolf- traps.
Knight Gregoire de Fronsac...... en the man called Mani were hunters nor soldiers.
As taxidermist of the king..... the Knight in Paris the reputation of a free minded and... intellectual person.
The one who was following him..... as his shadow was a stranger nobody knew of.
When evening fell...... they offered themselves to the castle of marquis Apcher...... who gave them shelter as long as their mission in Gevaudan would last.
Our people are not afraid of an ordinary wolf.
The Beast is different.
It flees from men like it knows it has to.. but it spares neither women nor children.
Have you seen it?
- No.
How do you know it' s an animal then?
Those who survived gave that description.
It' s much bigger then a wolf and it doesn' t fear bullets.
I understand your scepticism.
I don' t believe in monsters either...... but I had a report made for you..... of the crimes of the Beast.
You can judge yourself.
Grandfather said you were fighting the English in Canada...
Yes.
I went there to study the animals and nature.... but I came back hurt and with the grade of captain.
In an old abbey.
She came back from a party... when the Beast attacked her.
The Beast vanished...... but it deformed her face...
Tell me, Knight, how is Mr Buffon?
And how are things in Paris?
Read about it already?
It is kind of late for philosophy.
You' re right.
How about the theatre?
Do you know actresses?
What are they performing this winter?
Put it right there.
People say she is courteous.
I' m not sure if it' s true, but they offered their charms.
Tell me.
With this your curiosity will be satisfied.
Mercurius of France.
We only have the Post of Avignon.
I will show you the sleeping room.
He is sleeping over here.
- Good.
Good night, Knight.
It' s not Versailles, but the wine is good.
Fat as a pig...
What attacked him, was not a wolf.
The snout was longer and the teeth were like knifes.
If it' s not a wolf, what is it then?
A devil.
- Knight.
The Beast attacked a women in Saint- Alban.
There.
Don' t worry Knight, nobody is here.
Stop.
Son of a whore.
Good day, captain.
Sir Marquis.
I greet you.
There are traps everywhere.
This is Gregoire de Fronsac, of the garden of the King.
He wants to see the body of this unlucky soul.
With your permission of course.
You treated my men merciless
I did not know they were acting in your command.
They were not.
You did good and I apologize.
My soldiers are made for war, not for hunting.
The intestines were emptied and now there is poison in it.
What kind of gardener are you?
When the Beast is dead, the king wants it examined...... and save it in Paris.
I have to stuff it after the hunt.
Now I try getting familiar with it.
With such jaws the animal should weigh 250 kilos( 55 lbs).
This time I will catch it.
Before the first snow I will have it.
If everybody helps, it can' t escape.
Did you see it already?
- Once now.
I shot it and hit it.
It collapsed but got up instantly again.
We lost it south of the Mouchet.
Did it look like this?
It had some sort of black bar... with stings Do you understand?
Friends, let me introduce you the maker of the drawings.
Knight Gregoire de Fronsac...... the man comes from Paris to.. catch the Beast.
His Eminence, the bishop of Mende.
His Eminence, the duke of Moncan
His Eminence, the count of Morangias..... and Mrs. Count and their son Jean- Francois...... who has traveled a lot too...
Good, my lord.
Thank you, my lord.
My lord Laffond, our intendant.... and the priest of Saint- Alban, Henrie Sardis.
Are people talking a lot about the Beast in Paris?
People even sang about it.
- They should prey.
Would Captain Duhamel need Gods help?
Who can without god' s help?
Duhamel disguises his soldiers in women.
To get the Beast.
- Duhamel does all he can.
Duhamel is incapable.
But the Beast is still there.
Like taxes are meant to be for paying Duhamel...... I rather give it to my servants.
What do you think?
My lord Duke likes carp at, but he is a good Christian.
When you arrived, they were boring me...... with the good God and all that holy talk.
The pope would even have sent a spy...... to see if the Beast has anything to do with the devil.
Excuse me.
Marianne de Morangias.
Difficult, very difficult.
Everybody was breaking their minds about it.
Who is next?
- Maxime des Forets.
That will be easy.
- Be careful.
He' s a Morangias...
Mrs..
- Hello, my lord, we were talking..
Are you Maxime des Forets?
What a pleasure.
Good actors are rare.
- The Marquis?
He' s thinking about you.
He is in a good mood.
But act like you don' t know and let him start talking about it.
Mrs. excuse me....
Aren' t you ashamed?
No.
So, Mr. stuffer... do you like our region?
Until now I only saw beauties.
Or at least one of them.
Do people talk about girls this way in the court?
Something like this you should save for the innocent farmers.
I would go to the court if there were women like you.
Let' s eat.
I' il follow you.
We were in Saint- Laurent for 12 days already when we found the most..
.. bizarre animal in our nets I ever saw
The indians told me about holy fish...... but I was convinced it was a legend.
I saw a fish with the looks and size of a trout.... but it' s body was completely covered with a hairy skin as black as poison.
A hairy trout?
You' re joking.
- No, my lord.
Salmo Truta Dermopilla, from Canada.
That is really strange.
- As soft as fur.
Nature is extraordinary.
The water will be cold...
It proves the impossible is possible sometimes.
With this discovery you earned a lot of respect.
I doubt he deserves that.
But I admit, Knight, you got talent as an actor.
If I would have two hands, I would give an applause.
Jean- Francois.
Please excuse him, my lord.
Your son is right, Sr. Earl, that animal doesn' t exist.
My embalmer in the garden of the King is very handy.
So you say the Beast does not exist..... and we are idiots?
I only say that... people only used dragons or squirrels in books or poems.
Lies are sometimes true if they are being told correctly.
Watch out, my lord.
We might not understand you anymore now.
By the way, are you a philosopher?
Or worse... an actor?
I think the Knight is mainly someone from Paris.
Enough about that Beast.
Shall we do some riddles?
I just made a poem.
If Mrs. Earl allows...
- Immoral?
No, no.
It' s not far- fetched.
Just popped into my head.
It' s called "The Wolf".
"I didn' t pay any attention to it.
Without thinking of evil, I look at you
Your secret glance strikes me.
The wolf, the wolf, the wolf "
Will I see you again soon?
Do you have any other mystical animals?
Allow me to change that.
- Try it.
Will you be attending Duhamel' s battue?
I forbid you.
It' s far too dangerous.
Obedience is the first virtue of young women.
That young man is right.
It was on that day the biggest battle ever to be held in Gevaudan took place.
The King promised 6. 000 pound to the one who killed the Beast.
Thousands of peasants and soldiers joined the hunters.
During a few hours we forgot we were hunting the Beast.
Everyone got a map and a place to assemble.
We start at 7.
Go ahead.
My people have other things to do.
Your generosity matches your courage and...
Enough.
I hope for your sake that we catch it this time.
That' s a certainty, Sir Duke.
What kind of racket is that?
A beautiful weapon, not?
I had it made by a weapons blacksmith in Mende.
You understand that I wanted it custom made.
I mold them myself.
Silver?
You fear werewolves?
No, but I want to leave a signature.
Its a passion that has cost me a lot.
What happened to you?
I' ve learned that some predators need more then a bullet.
There' s more to curing gangrene then a prayer.
- A lion.
2 years in the marine made me travel a lot.
You don' t know Africa, Fronsac.
Gentlemen... my daughter is to blame.
Punish her accordingly.
A witch.
The daughter of the devil.
Look at her, a demon.
She' s sick, she' s not possessed.
She' s not possessed.
Bewitched.
She will suffocate.
She' s not possessed.
She' s not possessed - I know
And even a healer.
Congratulations.
She didn' t come.
Marquis.
And the people?
Superstitious.
Nothing different than this place.
The Indians eat the heart of their prey, for its strength.
Is that why they are savages?
In Africa they eat the heart of their enemies.
Sir Duke, Jean- Francois, move your people eastwards.
There you are.
- Your mother will be worried.
If I had listened to her, i wouldn' t be in the convent.
I know you don' t believe me, you' re a free thinker.
Not when one is in love.
- Are you in love?
Ridiculous.
We hardly know each other.
You think that its about you?
Marianne.
She has to learn to ride like a woman.
Practice never hurt anyone.
My father never sees any evil.
- My son sees evil in everything.
People died here.
How do you know that?
I hear their screams.
- Mani, stop that.
He' s right.
There was an army camp here.
When it was torched, 25 heretics died.
Is he psychic?
That' s not needed.
To observe is sufficient.
When I was little, i came to play here with my brother.
Weren' t you afraid?
He would protect me against the ghosts.
Don' t you like the hunt?
- Is that a crime around here?
According to indian custom, you steal someone' s soul if you draw them.
Does my soul interest you?
Do you want to get mutilated?
It' s my fault.
- I ask nothing of you.
What was that?
- Only a wolf.
And what if it was the Beast?
- I don' t think it was, Marianne.
Thanks.
I hope the Beast is one of the wolves.
They wont be eating anyone.
What a special person.
Where did you find him?
- In Canada.
An Acad?
An Indian.
An Irok, from the tribe of the Mohawks.
An Indian?
A real one?
He doesn' t look like an Indian.
Make sure that you' re in Saint- Alban tonight.
We' il entertain ourselves with your servant.
He' s not my servant.
What is he then, cursed?
- My brother.
How can you mix your blood with that of a savage?
He who shares my discomfort, is no savage.
Because of Mani I was able to escape from the English.
I thought those animals were cannibals.
As you can see, Sir Intendant, Mani is no animal.
Would you be able to procreate with a woman of our race?
All women are equal once the candles are extinguished.
Yes, they' re clear of mind.
The Indians slept with white men and had children.
We are equals.
That' s said hasty.
It' s a bit like with black men...
What do you think of it, Sardis?
Your blood- brother must be a child of God.
You had him baptized?
Good.
You follow times closely.
- Mani has his own believe.
He was some sort of priest in his tribe.
They are lost.
What is their believe?
A totem
Nice, but I don' t understand.
Would you mind?
It won' t hurt.
U...
Caribou... thats some kind of deer.
Yes, a deer.
Am I a deer by the horns or by somebody else?
What is his..... totem?
- Worm.
A book- worm.
A snake?
- Snake?
With the Indians, Snakes stand for wisdom
Wise snake.
And you, my lord Intendant?
A pig.
Away with those wrinkles.
With those barbarians the pigs may represent nobility.
Who is next?
Sardis?
No
And me?
What am I?
Half a lion, half an eagle?
Change me in a lizard, so my arm will grow back on.
Enough.
What' s wrong?
Am I going too far?
Let me, let me.
Mrs., would you?
Excuse me, but your tricks bore me.
Good evening.
That will relax you.
It' s not Paris, but it' s the best Mende offers.
And it sleeps better than in an inn.
They are all for you, gentlemen.
And we have a new...
My dear Marquis, come.
I' m expensive, Gregoire de Fronsac.
Do we know each other?
- From here Gevaudan looks small.
Italian?
A passage in this beautiful country.
I got some money.
Thats not the only issue.
And?
Who did that?
An Irokese arrow.
Your heart was not far away..
Maybe I am.. a man with luck.
And that?
A bear.
And he didn' t love me.
You haven' t seen anything yet.
I have a dangerous job.
Not all men have manners like you.
That' s a recollection on me.
That is a scandal in my house.
What is this?
- I don' t sleep with wizards.
What does it mean?
- He got snakes on his body.
Our reputation is at risk.
It' s nothing, it is an Indian.
Not a wizard.
I don' t want Indians.
- You hookers are difficult.
And, girls?
Who' s going with the Redskin?
I double the price.
- Well, everything is gonna be alright...
Are you a wizard?
Are you going to sketch me?
If your not honest.
Several weeks passed...... and the soldiers couldn' t find the Beast.
It was the 3th winter under his lordship...... and we knew the snow and the cold...... just like our weapons, would not make it stop.
Think about the threatens God announced through Moses' mouth..
"I will come to you like a bear lost her whelps"
I shall tear your children like a lion.. and send the Beast that will consume you.. and your cattle, and will make... deserts of your roads. "
How long will you stay angry, Lord?
One candle per victim.
Do you really think we live in a rational time?
Mercy.
I ask forgiveness.
Mercy.
Bless me.
What is it, my son?
God punished me.
I' m doomed.
We' re all doomed.
Gather your men, we leave at once.
Warn Mani, I see you on the way.
Good evening, friend of the wolves.
I' ve got something for you.
I would like to speak with you, Marianne.
Alone.
In 10 days my mother and father will both go away.
10 days?
I am not as free as you are.
Bring me the torch.
Bring the torch.
The storm starts and they are tired.
We' d better go home.
Let' s find the girl.
I found the child.
Captain, those traps you set catch more farmers than wolves.
Your men are leaded by misuse of power.
And since your chase the wolf has killed 12 times.
It shouldn' t have escaped.
What?
- It shouldn' t have escaped.
And you, Knight, do you know what kind of wolf it is?
The only certainty I have, is that it' s not a wolf.
A wolf does not attack people.
I observed them in Canada.
Maybe there the wolves are different.
A wild wolf would attack anybody.
If it gets frantic, it will die in 2 weeks.
And still it' s running around here for 2 years now.
By the way, I saw wounds a wolf could never have made.
And I found, in a body of a victim, a piece of iron.
And?
- And?
No animal has iron teeth.
Is the Beast not an animal then?
Well, how do we catch it?
As we are talking, it kills people.
I think we should listen carefully to Fronsac.
So, Knight, you think The Beast is not an ordinary animal.
I' m glad you admit its something extraordinary.
I don' t admit anything Sir.
I only have my doubts.
Knight, do you have something left to say?
No gentlemen.
Gentlemen, I received this from Paris.
Captain Duhamel, His Majesty was informed about your mistakes..... and I was asked to get you off this case.
You and your men leave at once to your regiment in Langogne.
Sir Beauterne is already on his way to Langogne.
His Majesty gave orders to kill the wolf.... and he is the only one who is allowed to hunt in the district.
Gentlemen.
Have you forgiven me?
Do I say that properly?
I would say...... a mermaid.
You are never serious.
I will ask your Red- skinned man.
And the Beast?
No.
- Don' t you want to talk about it?
I could only make some absurd suppositions.
When I say the Beast is made of flesh and iron...... that it can think and disappear when it wants to.
What would you think?
- That our air would make you talk nonsense.
People would think that it hides for me.
You haven' t been long here and you already want to be finished.
Did you think the Beast would surrender that easily?
Maybe it' s scared of you.
- Am I so scary then?
You enjoy a lot more from a difficult victory.
Jean- Francois said you wanted to go to Africa.
It' s a dream of a taxidermist who is fed up with the winter.
Don' t you want to discover other regions?
The women have more duties then desires.
Do you see Sardis on the walls?
Does he keep an eye on you?
It watches me.
Who knows what will happen.
Come, the priest will catch a cold.
Good night, Knight.
Good night, Knight.
You' re in love.
- I don' t know.
I know.
The maps?
I didn' t need them for you.
Let us drink.
To Mrs. Morangias.
Why?
Her brother was there too that night.
Did you sleep with him?
With him?
He is not to be touched.
He looks, he drinks...... and when he' s drunk, he talks in his sleep.
What do I say then?
Do you know how Florentine women keep their men at home?
They give their husbands slowly working poison each morning.... and each night an antidote.
Men who sleep elsewhere will have a bad night because of that.
A women like you doesn' t need that.
And by the way, we' re not married.
Make room for Antoine de Beauterne..... carrier of His Majesty, who will release the region..... of the Beast.
- Oh I remember.
The servant of Buffon.
The taxidermist and embalmer.
He sleeps with the intendant.
We have an appointment at 2 exactly.
His Majesty asked me your opinion about your report.
Complicated fables...
I think the Beast is a wolf.
Tomorrow I will leave to investigate.
I don' t want you to join me.
Why not?
The King wants me to do it..... and me alone..
I don' t need you to complete this.
You' il find a letter signed by Buffon on the table..... and our beloved King.
But believe me, it' s not...
I read your report.
Don' t waste energy for the Beast anymore.
I will take care of it.
You can go.
Come, come, come.
She came back from a party.
We lost it south of the Mouchet.
It just disappeared.
Knight, the Beast attacked a women in Saint- Alban.
God punished me, my children are gone.
His snout was longer and the teeth are like knifes.
It' s not an animal?
No animal has iron teeth.
Knight, you have to come at once.
I saw it.
He poured poison and said satanic words.
God knows how long this has been going on.
Let him be.
It' s an Indian remedy.
Only our prayers can save her
A miracle.
Tell me.
What happened to your brother?
A man with the Beast.
- She doesn' t know what she is saying.
The Beast is dead.
It didn' t survive.
We brought the necessary.
Start at once.
Mr. Beauterne is coming.
Ridiculous.
This is not the Beast.
- Like I said, Mr. Beauterne is coming.
I don' t like the way you work.
- Bye, Knight.
Leave us.
Don' t you like my Beast?
What' s the meaning of this?
You know this is not the Beast.
His jaws are twice as big as these.
- You got everything to fix that.
I must bring the Beast to Paris, and I got this wolf.
You should make a Beast for me.
Do you want the King to believe..
- No, Fronsac.
I carry out his will.
That would be wise.
- Are you threatening me, my lord?
You know who I am.
If you do your job, the king will be grateful.
If you don' t do your job he will be very disappointed.
Do you have everything you need?
Previously on "Alias"...
Someone now has the ability to detonate six nuclear weapons, and I am responsible.
So I am going to be part of the team that finds and disarms those warheads.
I need your help.
There are two things you need to know about this necklace.
It' s layered with C- 4.
If you remove it while it' s armed, you' il break the circuit, and it' il detonate.
I' il activate this remote trigger and blow your head off myself.
Back up now!
We' d like the warheads you' ve acquired.
Thank you for the supplies.
The necklace has been deactivated.
I' il have to call you back.
When?
- Just now.
- You' ve confirmed this?
Yes.
Combat?
What just happened?
It' s over.
Can we tell if there' s survivors?
Not with this bird.
We need new satellites.
Even if they survive, sending in a team is out of the question.
They' re on an authorized mission.
A clandestine mission.
Pakistani- supported rebels have acquired nuclear weapons.
I' m gonna get called in front of committees demanding to know why we screwed up!
The only thing we' re interested in is how to make this problem disappear.
I want an options paper from you in two hours.
After that, I' d like to look for the Bristows.
I shouldn' t have to define your priorities.
I don' t think we should cut them loose.
Alive or dead, the mission failed.
Hey, man.
Check this out.
Nothing like more bad news?
Maybe they were a roving patrol.
No, PRF rebels would never be this deep into Indian territory without being dispatched.
Your father' s right.
Now that' s gone.
Just a second.
Can' t stop.
More patrols could be in the area.
Nothing.
I just scraped my leg.
Dad, I can do it.
I got it.
You need to stop the bleeding.
Where are you going?
They have Myrtus Communis berries.
Their juice soothes the skin, helps healing.
You should put this on first.
- Seriously, I' m fine.
- You' re not.
No, you' re not fine.
Jack, I know you' re determined to get to Srinagar, but my contact in Jaipur is much closer.
He has good equipment.
I have operational control.
You' re a prisoner.
Your only function, sole reason you' re breathing air, is to use your knowledge of the rebels' base to help us steal the suitcase nukes and leave.
That' s why we' re using people I know and trust.
I' m not having this conversation again.
- You okay?
- Thanks.
This is not a power play.
The facility we' re headed for, security' s tighter than the NSA.
If I don' t have the right equipment, it' s pointless.
We should move.
I know what you' re thinking.
Do you?
The toaster.
What are you guys talking about?
We used to have this toaster at home.
I started a small fire.
We had something like this to drink, and we both had a little too much.
I forgot about the toast I was making.
When was this?
You were 4 years old.
There was so much smoke, we had to move out for a week.
We stayed in that hotel.
Summit.
Was that the hotel with the sundaes?
I think you had one every night.
You should get some sleep.
I would have called.
I need your help.
Yes, of course.
No one can see you dressed like this.
It is good to see you again.
You too.
You look well.
Imagine how bad I looked before.
Are you who I think...
- Yes.
He always brags about you.
He showed me a picture once...
We need to penetrate a class- A target outside Muzaffarabad.
We' il need aliases, papers, transpo, ammo, sat phone, and security penetration.
- Would you like some tea?
- No, thank you.
We also need tactical gear and night vision goggles.
Yes... except no.
My main supplier died two months ago.
Heart attack.
We are old men, Jack.
We don' t live forever, especially in Kashmir.
What kind of security?
Biometric sensors.
- Fiber optics on the fence.
None.
We' re behind schedule.
Well, I can do what I can do, but it might not be enough.
We' il take whatever you' ve got.
Thank you.
You need to be looking not like you.
Hi.
Sydney.
We saw the blast.
What happened?
We were compromised.
I' m glad you' re okay.
What about your parents?
Some people go miniature golfing.
We go to India and look for nukes.
We intercepted a communication.
The rebels say they' re activating the nukes tomorrow.
- We don' t know.
Deploy, detonate?
Activate.
It might mean delivery, detonation.
We don' t know, but we have to assume the worst since they got the control codes through SD- 6.
I can deactivate the nukes.
If you get there in time.
Perfect.
My truck is on the other side of the market.
I owe you.
What kind of air filter does it have?
- A foam filter.
It' il clog up in the desert.
We' il return the truck as soon as we can.
It' il never get us there.
This is my decision.
It is not negotiable!
Listen to me!
We have a job to do.
Please excuse us.
Right now we have six suitcase nukes that are going to be activated tomorrow.
Is that confirmed?
They want us to deactivate the nukes.
ClA needs to get authorization for a strike now.
They need confirmation the nukes are there.
- It' il be too late.
- Not if we work together.
This is the way it' s gonna be.
It' s his call.
Once we arrive, Mom takes over.
You know your way around.
You' il lead us to the nukes and back out.
Then you' il resume control and get us home.
There will be no objections to and no deviations from this plan.
Irina, you' il be in the fourth.
You can' t be serious.
She' s the most likely to be recognized.
We have a better chance of avoiding detection if we alter our configuration.
You sure she can breathe in there?
Dad, we need to get moving.
I know.
I' m just... preparing myself to let Irina out.
It' il be fine.
- Dad, my point was...
The truth is...
I needed to hear it.
That' s all.
Thank you.
What are we doing here?
This is not the drop.
The filter got clogged, didn' t it?
We' re still 10 miles away from the base.
We need to hike to the field, where we' il access a sewage tunnel.
That' il lead us into the facility.
I thought you said security was heavy.
It is, on the other side of the facility.
At the entry point we' re using, the rebels rely on land mines to keep intruders away.
We don' t have the equipment to detect land mines.
We don' t have the equipment because your contact didn' t come through.
I know where the mines are.
You' il walk through a minefield you haven' t seen in 19 years?
- And assume no new mines?
I just spent five hours in a grain bin.
It' s my turn now.
Let' s get to it.
I spoke with Gerard Cuvee, leader of the PRF.
He' s quite charming.
More like a banker than a rebel leader.
But you' re a money man, too, aren' t you?
Is everything in place?
The nuclear cores will be activated at 1700 hours.
As soon as it' s done, they' il upload the results to our server.
Sir, I have someone calling regarding your wife.
- They won' t identify themselves.
- Record the call.
I need some privacy.
Your wife' s ring finger.
And now I have her.
What do you want? $100 million in bearer bonds.
This is about money?
Everything is about money.
Instructions for the drop have been electronically mailed to you.
You' ve got 24 hours.
Fail to deliver the bonds, and the next delivery will go to The Alliance.
Where did the PRF get all these mines?
You Americans have the worst inventory controls in the world.
So, Sydney, how' s school?
Supposedly.
Quiet.
Behind the tree!
To your left, Jack!
Jack, I need a gun.
Don' t move.
You' re on a mine.
Sydney, don' t move!
Five steps forward.
Three to your left... and straight towards us.
Are you hurt?
The bullet hit my vest.
It' s an M- 26 anti- personnel mine.
We' il need to pry off the panel and remove the blasting cap.
Her knife' s not coated.
If she cuts with metal, she' il complete the circuit and set it off.
I can do it.
It' s okay.
We should hurry.
Follow closely.
I have no way of initiating.
Why?
The Indians found out the rebels have acquired nukes.
They' re launching air strikes in 24 hours.
We have to get them to back off.
They' re angry we knew and kept it from them.
They' re insisting on going forward.
Then let me make a personal appeal.
State, NSC, DOD.
You' re probably gonna say no to this... but I want to go to India.
- I have relationships with...
- Go.
Go?
I' il have a military aircraft waiting.
This is totally back- channel.
You' re just gonna...
Are you trying to get rid of me?
Clear.
We' re here.
The nukes will either be in a sealed R& D lab or a vault located in the sub- basement.
The lab' s security system is more sophisticated.
So check the vault first?
Not if we only get one shot.
The lab has thermal sensors to detect intruders through their body heat.
If we raise the room to body temperature, 98. 6 degrees, the sensors won' t be able to distinguish between us and the thermostat level of the lab.
Sydney, you' il get to the central heating control panel.
It' s located in a room near the stairwell in the sub- basement.
- Find the panel for Zone 3.
- Got it.
Jack, the lab door is controlled by a voice- recognition system.
Only Cuvee' s voice is programmed to open it.
We need to break into the main computer system here to access his file.
You' il erase his voice and substitute your own.
I' il be in Cuvee' s private office.
Not in here.
Jack, listen to me.
No.
I' m not blind to that.
But I' m also far from trusting you.
If you want those nukes for yourself, this is a perfect setup.
You were an officer in this facility.
Friends?
Know what this place was when I was here, Jack?
Where the KGB interrogated suspected traitors.
And, no, I wasn' t an officer here.
I was a prisoner.
Why do you think I learned the sewage tunnels or memorized the mine locations?
So I could escape, you idiot.
We' re out of time.
We either split up and meet at the lab in five minutes, or we' re going back.
It' s your choice.
Dad, she' s right.
We don' t have any more time.
I' il be in the lab in five minutes.
I promise.
You better be.
Thank you for agreeing to this emergency meeting.
Despite my best efforts to comply with your orders to kill my wife after she learned the truth about SD- 6, someone interfered.
And this person is now extorting me for her return.
Her ring finger.
Lab tests confirmed Emily was alive when they severed the finger.
Blood coagulation tests are not 100% accurate.
Yes, but they are reliable.
Then, two days ago, Security Section obtained those.
Those are photographs of airport security in Santiago and London.
And we have confirmed that Emily was on flight manifests last week.
Any idea on the men with her?
No, but the blackmailer wants $100 million in bearer bonds for her return.
Who else knew about your instructions to kill Emily?
Only the people in this room.
You believe one of us may be behind this?
No.
But someone has infiltrated our secure communications.
No.
It' s not quite that simple.
We have to eliminate this leak before more damaging information about The Alliance gets out.
That we follow the blackmailer.
You understand, Arvin, after all this, if you get your wife back, she will still have to be eliminated.
I understand.
The thermal sensors are neutralized.
- Where' s your mother?
- I haven' t seen her.
We got this far.
She must have gotten to Cuvee' s office and disabled the system.
She' il be here.
We' re not waiting.
Use the control codes to begin deactivation.
The plutonium core is gone.
Hi, Mr. Sloane, it' s me.
Marshall.
But... sorry.
You probably already know that.
We planned this.
Anyway, the tracer on the bonds is working perfectly.
I' m turning off my comm.
I see you.
Leave the briefcase on the bench and keep walking.
Proceed toward the corner while we verify the authenticity of the bonds.
Come on.
Go to the row of vending machines.
Take the "City View." Fifth from the top.
Magic Marshall' s invisible liquid tracer.
I say, come on!
Wait a minute.
No.
Where did...
Oh, God, no.
Not to brag, but I' m kind of responsible for matchmaking you and Irina.
Didn' t she tell you?
I was a supervisor at the KGB.
And marry a ClA officer.
You weren' t the only prospect, but you had the most potential.
I actually thought it would dawn on you that a woman like this would never go for someone like you.
Luckily for me... your ego was too big for that.
You' re a dead man!
I want what we came for.
Sark' s made a deal with us.
What kind of double cross is he planning?
We know Sark has a new partner.
Who is it?
And meet me in my office.
I was caught.
I had to do this, or we' d all be killed.
They' re not detonating the nukes.
Here' s what you have to do.
Is everything on target?
We ran into a few problems, but...
What kind of problems?
We' ve got it under control.
We' il proceed as planned.
I' il expect your report within the hour.
Trust me on this.
If you don' t make it out, I' m sorry this happened.
Mr. Vaughn, good to see you again.
But I' m afraid you came a long way for nothing.
We have people at the PRF base stealing the nukes.
If they fail, we' il be the Pakistanis' target.
- They won' t fail.
- You can' t guarantee that.
If you launch those strikes, you will be killing some of our best assets.
They said nothing.
They place our country at risk.
At least delay a few hours until we get our people out.
I' m sorry.
The air strike goes as planned.
You look more like your father every time I see you.
My father wrote about you... in his journal.
He wrote that he trusted you and respected you, and that is why I came such a long way.
I cannot call off the strike.
But I will give you a head start.
Meaning what?
Meaning a chopper and a pilot.
But if you' re going to try to rescue your friends, you' re doing so at your own risk.
Dad!
- How did you get free?
Your mother is helping us.
What about Cuvee?
She was torturing you.
She was putting on a show for Cuvee.
Before she left, she put these in my hand.
She told me they' re using the cores to activate a Rambaldi artifact.
They' re not detonating the nukes?
Rambaldi experimented with self- sustaining cell regeneration.
This artifact they' re opening is reported to be Rambaldi' s proof of endless life.
We have no time to make any meaningful assessment.
Your mother claims to have provided us the opportunity to contact the ClA for extraction, and we should act on it.
We' re going against the wind.
- Operations.
- This is Mountaineer.
Voice I. D. Number Alpha Charlie 7- 1- 10.
I need to speak with Agent Vaughn.
Vaughn' s not available.
Let me give you Kendall.
Agent Bristow, do you have the package?
We' re in process.
We' il need extraction.
Abort.
The Indians have launched air strikes.
Air strikes?
We' re not finished.
Fighter planes are in the sky.
You have to leave now.
I am ordering you out.
This is Jack.
You' il either hear from us again, or you won' t.
That' s our job.
A flower?
That' s what this is all about?
We need to get the cores and get out of here.
It' s Vaughn!
We' ve got the cores.
Tell them to call off the air strikes.
Abort the air strikes.
Abort the air strikes.
You must have a lot of questions.
One thing that should not wait any longer is why I shot you in Taipei.
The rebel leader, Gerard Cuvee, when you were in Taipei... he was in the next room watching to see if I would betray him or you.
It was the only way I could think to maintain his trust... and keep him from killing both of us.
We' re both tired.
You should get some rest.
You too...
... Mom.
Any word on the flower?
Preliminary analysis indicates that it' s anywhere from 400 to 600 years old.
Like I said, preliminary.
What' s this?
The future has not been written.
There is no fate but what we make for ourselves.
I wish I could believe that.
My name is John Connor.
They tried to murder me before I was born.
When I was 13, they tried again.
Machines from the future.
Terminators.
All my life, my mother told me the storm was coming.
- Connor!
The beginning of a war between man and machines.
Three billion lives would vanish in an instant.
And I would lead what was left of the human race to ultimate victory.
It hasn' t happened.
No bombs fell.
Computers didn' t take control.
We stopped Judgment Day.
I should feel safe...... but I don' t.
So I live off the grid.
No phone, no address.
No one and nothing can find me.
I' ve erased all connections to the past.
But as hard as I try...... I can' t erase my dreams...... my nightmares.
I feel the weight of the future bearing down on me.
A future I don' t want.
So I keep running...... as fast as I can.
Anywhere.
Nowhere.
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?
Do you want me to call 911?
I like this car.
Slow down and pull over immediately.
Lady, have you any idea how fast you were going?
Let me see your license and registration.
I like your gun.
What?
This stupid thing' s not working.
What' s wrong with this thing?
I hate machines.
- Hello?
- Kate, it' s your father.
You' re blowing me off again.
You know how much I wanted to see you this weekend.
- But we' re having computer problems...
- I know, you can' t talk about it.
It' s just...... Scott was really looking forward to this.
I really do.
You' re bound to run into him at the wedding.
I' m still in a state of denial about that.
- You' re not the only one.
You don' t need me to pass judgment on this guy.
You' ve done the right thing your whole life.
You never do.
I' m the luckiest father in the world, you know?
I' ve never had to be afraid for my daughter.
Listen, I hate this.
I promise I won' t cancel.
We will.
- Bye, Dad, I love you.
- Love you too.
- Okay, what have we got?
- This new computer virus is tricky.
It' s infected half the civilian Internet as well as secondary military apps.
- Payroll, inventory.
- Primary defense nets are still clean?
So far the firewalls are holding up.
Sir, the Pentagon has proposed we use our Al to scan the infrastructure.
Search and destroy for any hint of the virus.
I know, Tony, but that' s like going after a fly with a bazooka.
Once the connection' s made, it should only be a few minutes.
During which we' ve put everything under the control of a single computer system.
The most intelligent system ever conceived.
I still prefer to keep humans in the loop.
I' m not sure Skynet' s ready.
Yes, sir.
Thanks.
You' re supposed to go around to the back.
Hey, I said you' re supposed to go...
- Take off your clothes.
- Patience, honey.
Bitch.
Wait your turn.
- Your clothes.
- Talk to the hand.
Now.
Welcome to Jim' s Burgers.
Can I take your order?
- Jose Barrera?
- Yeah, that' s me.
Growing concern over widespread outages in the global digital network...... have prompted rumors of a new computer super- virus.
- Shit!
My mom' s home.
Hide the beer.
Take that.
Elizabeth and William Anderson?
My sister' s upstairs.
Is there something wrong?
What' s going on?
It' s an emergency.
Well, I' il be back before you get up.
Cool it, guys, it' s just me.
We' ve got a sick cat coming in.
Great.
Junkies.
Please, don' t do that.
I suppose it was you who ripped us off last week.
Put the phone down.
I needed some medicine.
There' s an emergency clinic half a mile away.
Can' t do that.
- Enough.
- Well...... this is the stuff we use to chemically neuter dogs.
Take a look.
You didn' t have to do that!
Next time bring a clue, not a paintball gun.
- No, this isn' t what you think.
- Yeah, right.
I think he' s got pneumonia.
He started coughing and wouldn' t stop.
- Betsy, I' ve got a problem in the back.
- A problem?
This is an emergency!
- It sounds like a hairball.
- I know what a hairball sounds like.
- Where' s Dr. Monroe?
I' m sure he' s home sleeping.
He' il come in if he has to.
Just wait in here with Hercules and I' il be a few minutes, all right?
Mike Kripke' s basement.
What?
What does that mean?
You' re John Connor.
I' m Kate Brewster.
We went to West Hills Junior High together.
- Jesus.
- What happened to you, John?
Middle of eighth grade, you just disappeared.
And there was that thing about your foster parents.
Yeah, they were murdered.
I didn' t do it.
What the hell?
Is somebody with you?
Katherine Brewster?
No.
John Connor was here.
Where did he go?
Tell me.
Where did he go?
Katherine Brewster?
What are you doing?
Let me down!
Let me down!
Where is John Connor?
If I tell you, will you let me go?
Yes.
He' s...... in the kennel, in a cage.
You said that you' d let me go.
I lied.
Please, please, please.
John Connor.
It is time.
You here to kill me?
No.
You must live.
- Why are you here?
Where are we going?
- Keep moving.
Get out of here.
Now!
- No pulse.
- See if you can get him down.
I can' t.
This guy weighs a ton.
Yes.
I' m being kidnapped.
- Where are you now?
I' m in my truck.
It' s a Toyota Tundra.
It says "Emery Animal Hospital" on the side.
I' m locked inside the back.
Hello?
Hello?
Shit!
Get off.
Let me out!
What are you doing here?
You got me into this.
- Stop the car.
Not yet.
Stop the car!
- Shut up!
Goddamn it.
Look what you did to my car.
This is my company car, asshole.
Get your ass out here.
Now!
What are you doing?
If you don' t have insurance, I' m gonna rip your balls off.
- I don' t want any problems, okay?
- Shut up!
Help!
Who' s talking back there?
- Calm down.
- I' m being kidnapped!
- Well, I' il be goddamned.
Help, please!
Get back here, asshole!
That' s the cops!
You have to pull over!
Yeah, first chance I get.
Hold on!
Stop it!
I' il drive.
Get out.
Excuse me.
Move over.
No sign of brain trauma.
Yeah, I' m fine, thanks.
Do you even remember me?
Sarah Connor?
Blowing up Cyberdyne?
"Hasta la vista, baby."
Ring any bells?
That was a different T- 101.
What, do you come off an assembly line or something?
Exactly.
I' m gonna have to teach you everything all over again.
Katherine Brewster, have you sustained injury?
Drop dead, you asshole!
I' m unable to comply.
Where are you taking me?
To a safe location.
Let her out.
Negative.
Katherine Brewster must be protected.
- I thought I was the one they were after.
So a T- X was sent back through time to eliminate your lieutenants.
So she' s gonna be in the Resistance?
No, you shouldn' t even exist.
I mean, we took out Cyberdyne over 10 years ago.
- We stopped Judgment Day.
- You only postponed it.
Judgment Day is inevitable.
I require a cutting tool.
Here, take the wheel.
- What are you doing?
- I am powered by two hydrogen fuel cells.
My primary cell was damaged by a plasma attack.
T- X is designed for extreme combat, driven by a plasma reactor...... and equipped with onboard weapons.
Its arsenal includes...... nanotechnological transjectors.
- Meaning?
- It can control other machines.
Its body chassis is heavily armored and hardened to withstand external attack.
- You' il find a way to destroy her.
- Unlikely.
I' m an obsolete design.
T- X is faster, more powerful and more intelligent.
It' s a far more effective killing machine.
Oh, great.
That' s great.
My presence in this timeline has been anticipated.
T- X is designed to terminate other cybernetic organisms.
So she' s an anti- Terminator Terminator?
You' ve gotta be shitting me.
No, I am not shitting you.
When ruptured, the fuel cells become unstable.
Relax.
- Relax!
Man, this is wack.
Every goddamn station.
Hey.
Are you gonna pay for that?
Talk to the hand.
Help!
Help me!
I think we better go.
Jerky?
You' re kidnapping me.
- God, you were always a delinquent.
And look at you now, sitting there like the bad boy thing still works.
What are you, some kind of gang member?
How do you live with yourself?
What?
Tell her who I am.
John Connor is leader of the Worldwide Resistance and last hope of humankind.
Right.
And him?
He' s a robot from the future.
Living tissue over a metal skeleton, sent back in time to protect me.
Go to hell.
He doesn' t mean you any harm.
I have a fiancé.
He' s gonna be looking for me.
What is it that you want?
Just...... imagine...... if you knew you were gonna do something important with your life.
Something amazing.
Maybe the most important thing anyone has ever done.
But there' s a catch.
Something terrible has to happen.
You couldn' t...... live with yourself if you didn' t try to stop it, but...
What are you talking about?
It' s just...
The life you know...... all the stuff that you take for granted...... it' s not gonna last.
Mike Kripke.
Back there, why did you say "Kripke' s basement"?
Because Mike Kripke' s house...... that' s where the kids used to go make out, right?
So you and me...
Wait, did we...?
Holy shit, we did.
We made out in Kripke' s basement.
I cannot believe you remembered that.
I must have made some kind of impression.
Give me a break.
I only remembered because the next day you were in the news.
Wait a second.
You and me hooked up the day before I first met him.
And now again, 10 years later.
We were supposed to meet.
Coincidence.
Yeah.
Hon?
Did you just get in?
Hi, I' m Detective Edwards, L. A. P. D. This is Detective Bell.
Is she here?
No.
- You' re her fiancé, Scott Mason?
- Yes.
There was an incident at the veterinary hospital where she works.
We' re concerned something may have happened to her.
Where is she?
We got a report from a gas station attendant near Victorville...... about a possible kidnapping and it might be related.
I' il help you find her.
Come with me.
Go.
Your mother?
I never even knew where she was buried.
I hit the road the day she died.
Why did you bring me here?
Hey, stop!
Stop!
Her friends scattered her ashes in the sea.
They stored these weapons in accordance with her will.
What happened to her?
Leukemia.
I' m sorry.
We were living in Baja when she was diagnosed.
They only gave her six months.
But she fought for three years.
Long enough to make sure.
To make sure?
That the world didn' t end.
"Every day after this one is a gift."
She told me, "We made it.
We' re free. "
But I never really believed that.
I guess she didn' t either.
You know you were about the closest thing to a father I ever had?
How pathetic is that?
Out of my way!
My mission is to protect you.
That' s enough.
I swear I will!
Go ahead.
See what happens.
Don' t do that.
Oh, my God.
This is the police.
We have the building surrounded.
Release your hostage!
Just leave me here.
I' m not the one you want.
You' re wasting your time.
Incorrect.
John Connor leads the Resistance to victory.
How?
Why me?
You are John Connor.
Christ, my mom fed me that bullshit since the cradle.
Look at me.
I' m never gonna...
Let go.
You' re right.
You' re not the one I want.
I' m wasting my time.
Fuck you, you fucking machine!
Better.
Oh, you were just dicking with me?
Anger is more useful than despair.
Basic psychology is among my subroutines.
Perps still holed up?
Gotcha.
Good news.
Your fiancée' s okay.
Where is she?
Greenlawn Cemetery, up off the 5 freeway.
It' s right by the desert.
But they' re gonna bring her back to the...
Oh, my God!
God!
You' re safe now.
They can' t hurt you.
Kate, my name is Dr. Silberman.
I' m a post- trauma counselor for the sheriff' s department.
How are you feeling?
He' s not human.
He' s really not human.
I know what it' s like to be in a hostage situation.
I' ve been there myself.
The fear, the adrenaline.
You find yourself imagining things.
Impossible things.
Crazy things.
Insane things.
Take years to get over it.
- Go, go, go!
- Move it!
Drop your weapon!
And the coffin!
Take him down!
Take him down!
Resume fire!
Why?
What makes her so goddamn important?
Through her, you contact remnants of the military and learn how to fight Skynet...... forming the core of the Resistance.
Later, your children will become important.
- What?
- She' s your wife.
Get in!
Come on!
- It was Scott!
How could it be Scott?
- Your fiancé?
The T- X is polymimetic, able to take the form of anything it touches.
Your fiancé is dead.
And so we' ve locked out the understanding of nations...... and we' ve locked in the poison.
Trojans jumping at every rumor...... pointing fingers at each other.
I tell you there' s only one solution.
Have your way.
Go to Sparta.
Go wherever you will...... but don' t try to drag the destiny of Troy with you.
What destiny, to live like a crab in a shell?
We live well.
That' s our blood.
Stupidity!
We' il choke on our own fat unless we sail our ships of trade.
But how can we, when every harbor is an enemy' s?
- Oh, I' m sick of your crazy dreams.
- Careful, brother.
Paris has always been able to crack your neck.
And you can thrash us both.
- Tell him he' s a fool, Hector!
- My sons...... the fool is the man who makes a quarrel of a debate.
Paris, I bless your plan to sail to Sparta.
I know I can trust you not to beg for peace.
I' il try to convince the Greeks our power makes a treaty advisable.
I' d take 100 ships of war and burn the soil of Sparta black!
I' m sure you would, Polydorus, and create endless war.
And you, Hector, do you aspire to anything...
- Yes, sire.
The javelin and the discus.
Hector' s a good son, Priam.
And a good husband, my lord.
Is that not sufficient glory?
By your leave, Paris' ship is ready to sail.
Do the gods approve the day and the hour?
The omens are good and also the prophecies, with but one exception.
One troubled priestess of the temple.
- My daughter.
- Don' t be angry, Priam.
- Cassandra is ill.
- Sick in the mind.
Arise, Paris...... and go.
The virgin Cassandra does make one point that causes me much concern.
Prince Paris, it appears, gives all his worship to one goddess alone.
- Aphrodite.
- I' m not sure I worship anything.
No.
Admiration is the better word.
Admiration for the beauty of a marble image.
It was not the goddess of beauty who taught us to arm against our enemies...... but Athena, the goddess of wisdom...... and the patroness of the horses of war.
Athena does not rejoice in this....
This solitary adoration of yours.
Neither is she delighted that you undertake a mission of peace.
And I suppose that evil horse of hers will spring out and trample me.
Let it come, my lord...... if that' s the price of living in a world of fables.
Do not say that, Paris.
Do not seek peace elsewhere, dear brother...... until first you have pacified Athena.
My little Cassandra, there can be no postponement.
Give me your blessing for a happy voyage.
I cannot bless what I see in your future.
- Cassandra, stop this.
- But, Father, it' s true.
What I see and feel is true.
Go, Paris.
Come, Cassandra.
- Come and rest a while.
- How can I, Mother?
Oh, I wish it hadn' t been given me...... this agony I live with.
Paris!
Please don' t go.
- I must sail at once.
- If you have any love for Troy...... don' t bring this dreadful thing upon us.
- And I thought you loved me best of all.
- I do, but...... the noise, the storm grows so great.
The screaming of horses, the cries of dying men.
- Take care of her.
- My dear, my dear.
Perhaps it could not be otherwise.
What must be, no one can change.
Where are we today?
Elysium?
Far from it.
We' re nearing Sparta...... a harsh military land, where a man will cut off his arm to prove he' s brave.
- I wonder what the women look like.
- My profound Cousin Aeneas.
To think deeply, Paris, one must think of women.
They bring all life into the world and much death.
- They sway the destinies of men.
- Not my destiny.
What' s the matter?
Oh, just a quickening of the breeze.
But I don' t like the hot breath of it.
Oh, it' s nothing.
Only one drifting cloud up there.
Up the mast with you!
- I command you!
- Drop the sail!
My prince, the ropes are fouled, and these men refuse to climb the mast.
- I' il flay them!
- No!
There' s only one way to cure these fantasies.
No!
Paris!
Paris!
Paris!
Paris!
Paris!
Paris!
Megas!
Aphrodite.
What?
Some ship had bad luck.
She does exist.
- Who?
- The fairest goddess.
This creature is crazy.
But with a nice sort of craziness.
What was your ship?
-... of Troy.
- A Trojan.
Cut him loose, Andros.
Maybe we can warm some life into him before we turn him over to the soldiers.
Women!
Why warm a man to cut his throat?
Cover him up, quickly.
We' re looking for our sovereign lady, the Queen of Sparta.
She came to the shore to visit a nurse of her childhood days.
- My lady.
- I left orders not to be disturbed here.
But there are certain developments which make this beach unsafe today.
A strange ship was sighted running out of the storm.
We couldn' t go after her.
Heavy seas.
It' s possible she left spies.
You see Trojan phantoms everywhere.
- This was no phantom ship.
- The emblem of the royal House of Troy.
The king would want me to insist that his queen return at once.
lnform King Menelaus that Cora is taking excellent care of me.
Go along now.
Very well, my lady.
Andraste!
- Andraste, help us carry this man.
- A man, my lady?
How interesting!
- I can' t risk hiding a Trojan.
- Yes.
What if he' s a warrior and only pretending?
You must be careful.
Women who are always careful miss much in life, Andraste.
He doesn' t seem to recover.
But his heart beats.
Give him some broth, and we' il turn him over.
- Good.
- Oh, no!
They' il kill him.
- I still say good.
- And I, too, would say so...
-... if he were as unattractive as you.
- Thank you.
To whom am I indebted for this gallant defense?
Nobody of importance.
I am only a slave.
Now tell us about yourself, Trojan.
Did I mention that?
My memory is clouded.
But I do recall I thought you a vision.
A goddess.
Dear Aphrodite...... allow me to present myself.
- Prince Paris of Troy.
- We' il dispense with impudence.
You' re a bit impudent yourself for whatever you are, a slave?
- Silence!
You' re addressing -- - A slave of the palace, Andros.
Of what importance is that?
I tell you truly, I am Prince Paris.
I come to offer a treaty of peace to King Menelaus.
But of course, you don' t believe me.
My articles of identity...... all the gifts I was bringing to the Court of Sparta....
My crew won' t come near a Spartan harbor now.
They' il swear the gods hurled lightning at me.
Perhaps I do believe you.
The sea has damaged your appearance, but not your manner.
You must leave here at nightfall.
Follow the coast.
You' il reach a cove where Phoenician ships put in.
I still have a mission.
- Do as I tell you!
Our soldiers have a habit of plunging a dagger into strangers.
And why should that worry you?
The feelings of a slave are of no importance.
They are to me.
In any place but Sparta, one so fair would be a queen.
In Troy, we' d make songs about you.
King Menelaus would not permit that here.
Because you' d make his queen look plain.
She would be pained to hear you say that.
Do you know her?
She owns me.
I' m her shadow.
And I always thought I knew her.
No, I don' t believe anyone knows Queen Helen very well...
-... including Helen.
- Not even the king?
Great power doesn' t need knowledge.
Wait.
I only ask these questions...
- Don' t chance it.
I intend to be discreet, so prepare me.
If Menelaus won' t help me, I' il ask the queen.
I --
Oh, if you were old and ugly, maybe then she could help you.
But you' re not old, nor ugly.
We must get the fish to market.
Gladly.
If the soldiers find him here, I don' t want to be involved.
I wouldn' t mind.
We must get back to the palace, Andraste.
I' ve stayed here too long.
Promise me...... we' il meet again.
You can go back now.
Supplies, for your voyage home.
So you still hope I won' t go to the palace?
More than ever.
The kings of Greece are gathering there to consider a war against Troy.
Then my mission was well- timed.
- When will they be in council?
- Tomorrow, perhaps.
But tonight...... there are only you and l.
Under the magic of the moonlight.
See what I brought you?
My dear little slave girl...... I don' t want what you steal from the palace.
I only want what I steal from the palace.
No, my prince.
Very well, then, I' il borrow you.
But we' il be quite honest about it.
- I' il offer to buy you from the queen.
That would mean death!
Nonsense.
I' il explain to her that you' re no slave to me...... but my future Princess of Troy.
Let me go, Paris.
Don' t you believe I could love a slave?
Yes, I believe.
My heart believes and loves you.
My heart is yours, Paris, but I can never be.
You must not seek out the queen, nor anyone at the palace.
And this moment must be our last.
Don' t ask me why.
Call it magic, call it a dream.
And never speak of it to anyone.
Hear our Spartan host, King Menelaus.
- Are you sure Ulysses is coming?
- His ship was not far behind mine.
This great Ithacan refused to leave his wife and farm.
He' s so sick of war, he wouldn' t let go of the plow.
Till his child was cast in front of it, to convince him Greece' s glory...... comes before contentment.
I' il take Troy' s gold.
Not my share, brother.
Ulysses, King of lthaca!
Greetings, friend.
You' re acquainted with everyone.
Ajax, Prince of Salamis.
Nestor, King of Pylos.
Diomedes, ruler of Aetolia.
And I think you know my brother, King Agamemnon of Mycenae.
Greetings, fellow pirates.
It is a righteous war we plan, Ulysses...... a war of defensive aggression.
A neat sort of righteousness.
You think the Trojans built a citadel for peace- lovers?
Have you heard of Priam' s sons?
Hector wants only a challenge.
Paris is anyone' s equal with a cestus, bow and javelin.
You believe they want peace?
All the more reason why we cannot plan without Achilles.
But he hates my brother and me --
He hates you almost as much as he loves war.
In order to lock himself from all temptation of joining with us...... he hid himself securely, in a house of women.
That' s where I found him, hiding from all persuasion...... dressed as a woman!
Did you persuade him?
He' s here at the stables, seeing to the care of his horses.
Achilles, a blushing girl.
I shall commend him for the beauty of his face and figure.
The man who blows his own horn.
Commend him, Menelaus.
I commend you, Achilles.
And I despise you.
And you, Agamemnon.
But it seems we must unite...... so I am here to lead you.
- Of course.
I and my good friend Patroclus.
Since we were boys, we could stand alone and defy an army.
- I question that.
- Who?
I, Ajax.
My imitator.
You disgusting glory- hunter.
To imitate him, I' d need to wear three layers of armor.
That' s where he gets his reputation for being invulnerable.
Silence this fool, Menelaus.
I would prefer not to be angered by him.
The truth of the matter is, his skin' s as tender as his vanity.
And especially his heel.
- He can' t even stand leather against it.
- I do not fight with my feet.
Take your ease, my prince.
I' il handle this buffoon.
Enough of this.
We must remain united.
lmpossible.
We' ve never been united, and we never will be.
Keep my horses ready.
Patroclus, we shall leave.
I see no ethical purpose for a raid on Troy.
- Nor I.
Wait.
Here.
You talk of ethics.
Here' s the sign of a Trojan ship prowling our shores.
No peaceful trader, but a royal ship of the House of Priam.
It was my ship, sire.
I am Paris of Troy.
- You are King Menelaus?
- Yes.
Sorry to present myself like this, I was swept overboard in the storm.
Fortunately, this gathering of the most royal of Greece...... makes my mission easier.
- How' d you know we were here?
- I beg my lord' s indulgence, I know.
So I' m saved from journeying to each king...... if you decide against offers of peace I bring from Troy.
- Troy does not plan war?
You are wrong, Menelaus.
Stop this or lose your Trojan plunder.
- Where' d you find this impostor?
- He came to the palace.
- I thought you' d question him.
- You interrupt council!
- Hear him.
- This is our business.
He' s only some wandering vagabond.
See the rags he wears.
These roving jesters come often to my palace.
And they never fail to have some nimble talent.
What do you do besides this royal imposture?
It seems I try to do the impossible.
The cesti.
If he' s Paris, he should have some skill with the cesti.
- Brilliant, brother, brilliant.
- You heard, Ajax, Achilles?
Achilles is weary from travel.
Achilles did not make his reputation fighting children.
This Sparta, my son, is a viper' s nest.
- I' il see you aren' t -- - If we offend the pretender...
-... I give him leave to go.
- No.
After all, part of my task was to spread civilization.
But I must exact an agreement.
If I come fairly out of this fight, will you believe that I am Paris...... and hear the Trojan peace terms?
If your head' s still on your shoulders, yes.
Paris!
My courage almost failed me at the thought of meeting Ajax.
You shall rest.
And tomorrow we shall talk.
About your adventures, your voyage...... and the secret charm that makes me call you "friend."
And Troy shall call Sparta "friend."
Alpheus, find quarters for our guest.
And, Alpheus...... they say the Trojans have great eyes for beauty.
Find him a slave and see that she is beautiful.
There is one slave in your palace for whom I' d gladly become a slave myself.
Menelaus!
You expressed a wish yesterday to present your guests to me.
A proud wish.
Helen, Queen of Sparta, wife to Menelaus...... I present Paris, Prince Royal of Troy.
Why are you here, Trojan?
To study our arts and culture?
Yes, my lady.
The art of self- preservation.
Trojan impudence!
By your leave, my lord...... I shall receive the Greeks at some happier moment.
I heard my lady was truly Spartan this afternoon.
My heart behaved like a fool.
I' m sure Menelaus could hear it beating.
You may go.
- When will you learn?
The man can neither speak nor hear.
What did you think of the Trojan?
- You saw what I thought.
- Yes, I saw what you thought.
Of this Trojan anyway.
What is this game you' re playing?
Helen, you reveal yourself.
So does he.
Speak plainly.
If I' ve given you some offense, punish me...... but don' t welcome a stranger with one hand and strike him with the other!
So now we' re fond of Trojans?
I might do many things with him.
I might send him home...... with his appearance altered.
I might hold him hostage to bleed tribute out of Priam.
I imagined once I had married a king.
- I married a robber.
Why did you marry him?
When a king takes spoils, he robs no one.
When he kills, he commits no murder.
He fulfills justice.
The way of a Spartan.
You do not.
I understand enough.
Then understand your place in the palace, nowhere else!
You' ve seen this man before.
Admit it.
Your silence condemns you.
You' ve been out of the palace secretly.
You know this man.
Silent as ever.
No words for me, your husband.
I am your husband!
- Don' t.
- Say "husband" to me.
Say "husband" to me.
I can think of many ways of dealing with your Trojan, Helen.
Andraste.
I am the slave sent to the Prince of Troy.
The queen' s handmaiden, eh?
The king commands me to entertain his guests.
A fine Greek custom, but guest?
He' s in a prison, if he only knew it.
Oh, I' m instructed that he shall not know it.
Must King Menelaus command you himself to admit me?
The royal temper' s already running a fever.
Shall I tell the king you said that?
Get to your business, you little troublemaker.
You should be in bed.
Yes, I should but --
But your mistress sent you to play another trick on me.
She sent me to help you escape.
Escape?
Those two soldiers on watch down there...... are they going to help me too?
You' re a captive.
The king plans tortures for you.
You must leave quickly.
Return to the fisherman' s hut.
I' il go a distance with you to point the way.
My good friend Menelaus.
- The door is also watched.
- Then what chance have I?
Helen thought to make you look like a merchant.
Any fool could see you' re a prince.
- Soldiers.
- Fisherman!
- Yes?
- Fisherman!
Yes?
- What do you want?
- A cup of wine.
- Oh.
Cora, the wineskin.
The captain' s an idiot.
Does he think the man will swim?
He' d be deep in the forest by now.
Here.
Take it with you.
Go, and remember, there will be soldiers above...... so you' d best try the rocks under the cliff.
Get to a cove beyond the tower.
There, a boat will send you to the ship.
Wings of Mercury speed you.
Why do you wait?
It was just a foolish hope.
- I half- imagined she' d come.
- Here?
She sent you garments...... arranged for a Phoenician ship to take you home.
What more, Trojan?
I didn' t really expect her to come.
- I only hoped.
- Don' t even breathe it.
If she should show her face here and be recognized....
I know.
And I wish I could repay you for your kindness.
And for the queen...... tell her she' il walk in all my dreams.
Wait!
The ship is not yet in the cove.
Helen.
Andraste, you are free.
- My lady.
You made clear to Adelphus what I said?
- He is far off by this time.
- Then be on your way.
Freedom is made of quicksilver sometimes.
Hurry.
Helen.
Helen is the queen.
The girl you thought you knew was quite nameless and without reality.
I can' t believe that.
- It was she who helped me to escape.
That was the queen who hates cruelty.
She would have done the same for any slave.
I see.
She is the queen who comes here to say this.
She will always remember the gentle Paris.
And she will do her small part to turn this nation from war.
- You' re not a Spartan.
- I am.
Daughter of a king who chose a Spartan husband for me.
A man you despised.
I despise oppression, as do many others here.
We need to be Spartan to endure it.
And we need to be understood.
You are.
You, not Menelaus, will be Sparta to me.
I' il tell my father there' s still hope.
I' il tell Troy what I' ve seen and heard.
The rulers divided, unable to find cause for war...... even the Spartan people.
Stop worrying.
The kings have been carousing all night.
And so she is real, that one I loved.
Yes.
The gods sometimes change the bravest of intentions.
They are kind.
I' il never doubt them again.
Oh, Helen.
Helen, you are a slave as long as Menelaus possesses you.
Come away to freedom.
Come to Troy with me.
And destroy the hope of peace you were taking home with you?
No.
If even one Trojan dies on the walls, I' m a failure.
Forgive me, Helen.
You are two women, both wise and good.
I am two men.
One fairly good, I try to believe.
The other, very bad indeed.
One is a man.
The other just a boy, I think.
Paris, let him be so always.
Never let him grow old.
Helen.
The ship.
And now I must go back.
It is a way the gods have...... to give with one hand and take with two.
This is not goodbye.
You shall still be with me across the sea.
And you with me.
And always young, Paris, remember?
What is remembered is forever young.
Halt!
Stand still, Trojan.
- My lady, I ask you remove yourself -- - Send your archers away.
I beg the queen to stand out of danger.
You wouldn' t dare.
You' il die.
I can no more than lose my own life, and it' s lost if I let him go.
Silence!
Helen!
Helen!
Helen!
She' s in there.
- No.
- She' s in there.
Break the locks!
- Break them.
Break.
It' s true.
The Trojan' s taken Helen.
He' s carried her away.
By force, against her will.
To think of her struggles, her fruitless cries for help.
We had our differences, but she was my wife.
It goes deeper than that.
This is the assault of all women in Greece.
Shame on every Greek nation.
Then man your ships.
Ulysses, why do you sit?
She must be restored to me.
Later.
- Yes.
Now, now, now!
Will you not stand with me?
Menelaus, we will reclaim her, and with her, all the loot of Troy.
But only if you wait.
We' il send out a call to every city in Greece.
All Greeks united in a war of honor.
Yes.
That' s what the future will call it.
I call it that now.
This Prince of Troy has asked for war, not peace.
Ulysses.
I' m sure you' il agree with me that it is my duty to become our leader.
Leader?
I' il see no one but Achilles as leader.
It is my consecrated duty to become our leader to avenge my dear brother.
Quite, quite, Agamemnon.
And I will follow you.
And tell you what to do, as usual.
And I will persuade the sensitive Achilles...... with certain fascinating facts...... about the great store of gold to be found in Troy.
I seek no treasure.
I will kill.
So shall we all, brother.
To defend your honor.
Who are they?
I don' t know, but I know the color of their gold.
Sparta is the past, Helen.
Troy is this way.
What will they call us there?
A woman who left her husband.
A prince turned thief.
What else can we ever be?
Two people in love.
Against the world, if need be.
If I could make a bargain with the gods...... we would escape the world...... never landing on any shore.
A lovely dream, but somewhere we must land.
Paris, there' s an island called Pelagos.
The sea can feed us.
And there are little houses near the village well.
Let' s go there.
I cannot.
I was born to an obligation.
Paris, son of Priam, heir to responsibility.
I could leave the kingdoms of the world and never miss them.
- But you -- - Helen...... our life together will fade if I run from this.
It will become a slight thing that any storm can tear apart.
No, Paris.
Forgive me.
I forget you are a woman, not a goddess.
Captain.
- You know the island of Pelagos?
- It' s far southward...
-... through the Cytherean straits.
- Sail southward.
- Captain.
- Yes?
We have decided otherwise.
Sail north to Troy.
- What is it?
- You' il have to see, Lord Aeneas.
Wait.
Aeneas, call the queen.
Paris!
Paris.
Come and meet my brothers.
Hector, Polydorus.
I told you about them.
You could fall in the black pit of Hades...... and come out with arms full of sunshine.
He' s always had a fine flair for surprises.
I' m happy to see that you diverted your mission...... to an enterprise more to your talents.
Come.
- Aeneas.
- Paris.
- Paris.
- I should have had faith.
The great god Zeus would never let him die...
-... and with him our hopes of peace.
- It' s a miracle.
Tell us what happened, Paris.
Here is your miracle.
I would never have seen Troy again but for her.
It would have taken a sea sprite to save you.
How could one so tender have managed it?
Postpone your questions.
She suffered an ordeal that I shan' t relate in her presence.
It' s enough that our son has been given back to us by you, my dear.
You are welcome, my child.
Paris, call the high steward.
See that she is made comfortable.
Later, you shall tell me of your adventures.
At your command, Father.
My brother seems to have forgotten his courtliness.
By what name, my lady, shall we know you?
- My name is -- - Her name is death.
- Cassandra!
- Forgive her.
She suffers an illness.
Wait.
You were going to say?
I am Helen, Queen of Sparta.
The wife of King Menelaus?
- His wife no more.
- The goddess of beauty, Aphrodite...... come down to Earth in mortal form.
She will bring the disaster I have prophesied.
Her name will be written in letters of fire.
Helen.
Helen of Troy.
And she saved my life again...... but at such risk to herself that I couldn' t leave her...... to the mercy of the Spartans.
I can see I' ve troubled you, sire.
But in your affection for me and mine for you...... I hope you will judge me fairly.
I would never have believed that this could happen...... not through this son of mine.
This son who shared my hope of everlasting peace.
And what have you brought?
Dishonor.
You have united the Greeks.
You have kindled a flame that will weld them together against us.
This will bring them to our very shores.
That should delight you.
You may have to answer for the death of many a good Trojan.
You have presumed too much upon our affection.
Paris...... send her back to Sparta and make your peace with Menelaus.
I' il never send her back.
- You reject every word of wisdom?
- My love has no logic.
It could only choose between Troy and Pelagos.
Helen wanted to go to Pelagos...... but I had to bring you the warning.
And she had the courage to come with me.
But she was right.
We' il seek it elsewhere.
The coward' s way to avoid the fight?
- You exceed the rights of a brother.
- And you....
You scorn every Trojan duty.
The damage is done.
Go or stay.
It matters not.
- I shall not see you again.
- Priam.
Bring to the council chamber the armory masters and the granary stewards.
Tell them I want an estimate of Troy' s ability to withstand a siege.
There were times when I almost forgot that I had other children, Paris...... others to die, perhaps.
Destiny, Paris.
Destiny.
Every Trojan woman with son or husband will curse you.
Well, don' t worry, brother, a war may clear the atmosphere.
War, the only thing that could make you happy.
Keep out of my way, or you' il never live to enjoy it.
- Lord Aeneas.
- You may go.
The ship that brought you to Troy is still in the harbor.
My charioteer will take you there.
I see.
Or if my lady prefers, I' il arrange for a royal escort.
No, I won' t delay.
Wait for us.
My chariot will be in the courtyard.
Athena wields much power, it seems.
- If I return to Menelaus -- - No.
Pelagos?
Yes, I' il take you to Pelagos.
You said our lives would fade if you ran away.
I also said that you' d be happy in Troy.
Paris, the word has spread.
- They are not armed with flowers.
- Quick, before they overrun the courtyard.
They won' t as long as they enjoy their carnival.
- Take Helen to the harbor.
- Don' t show yourself to them.
- See her aboard the ship.
- Paris!
Dog!
You expect us to fight a war for your amusement?
My brave Trojans...... will you show as much spirit against the Spartan army...... as against one Spartan woman?
Can you stand alone, each, in battle...... or do you need the cowardice of numbers to make you bold?
Go home and search your hearts, Trojans...... for all this must be answered soon.
- You can leave safely now.
- Without you?
I' ve gained a victory of a sort tonight.
I mustn' t lose it, Helen.
There' s no Pelagos if I' m there alone.
But there' s always one island where the storm can' t touch us.
It' s anyplace, Paris, where we' re together.
- Here?
- Oh, yes, even here.
The Trojans prepared for war.
Our signals have never warned of so many ships.
- That' s all right.
- Hundreds.
- Many more than we can count.
- Five, 600.
More.
- No less than 1000 ships.
- We' il make them pay a heavy price.
What shall we pay?
Let them see.
Yes, sire.
Faster.
Faster.
- See what you have brought upon us?
- Father.
The face that launched 1000 ships.
Now remember, these Trojan walls are our strength and our substance...... so let no eager fool attempt to charge this plain...... until these ramparts have served their purpose.
Well, to your posts.
Hector, where is my place?
Beside your Spartan woman.
Come with me, brother.
I' il share Spartan blood with you.
You can have my share.
No Trojans to greet us?
I had hoped they' d be foolish enough to scatter their forces.
- Where do we make camp, Agamemnon?
- Camp?
No, onwards.
Every moment of delay, my Helen suffers.
Our camp is the Trojan palace.
We must attack at once.
Against Troy' s walls, Achilles?
We must equip to take this fortress.
Ulysses is right.
We must prepare.
Follow Achilles!
Hector.
- To the ramps.
- We' re outflanked!
Fall back!
Return to your towers.
Back!
Back!
Polydorus.
It' s a good war, Paris.
Hector, the man of peace...... now our greatest warrior.
Thank Helen for your destiny.
- Thank Paris.
- I thank him for my life.
Oh, great Zeus, king of all...... we give to you Polydorus, Prince of Troy.
I pray you, judge him with compassion and understanding.
Let not Athena' s hatred feed on my defenseless son...... but on our sorrow here.
We, the living dead of Troy, shall pay his debt...... in the years of siege to come.
Take your hands off her!
- A warrior commanding his commander?
- She' s mine.
Great as you are, I' m still your chieftain, protector of all the spoils of war.
- Take her to my quarters.
- No.
Agamemnon, if you take this girl, I shall sail home.
Fly.
- Agamemnon!
Come on.
- Sail home, great warrior.
No, Achilles.
Out!
Out!
Out!
Achilles, Agamemnon does not speak for all our people.
Dogs!
Jackals!
I' il never fight his battles again.
But for Greece, you' il fight.
No more.
- Helen, how perfect.
- The girl you fell in love with?
Always keep that image with you, Paris.
I shan' t need to.
I have the source of its magic.
Right here, I hold its living warmth...... and its spirit is always with me on the ramparts.
Then it can' t be lost, can it?
What has been lived and shared is never lost.
- Never, Helen.
- But if you should lose me...... could you resign yourself to that?
Don' t worry, nothing will happen to you.
Nothing endures on Earth, Paris, neither sorrow nor happiness...... or people in love.
Dear Helen, she looks for shadows in the one bright place in Troy.
People in love should not be blind.
They should look to the future and prepare for separation.
But not so gloomily, my love.
I' il meet you in Elysium...... where an age of years is just a wink of time.
You charter a ship.
I' il take the flying horse, Pegasus.
To our island, Paris?
Oh, goddess come to Earth, make me immortal with your kiss...... and we' il live on nectar and ambrosia.
- Nor I.
How many years, fellow Trojans, shall we suffer?
Our only respite, a truce to burn our dead.
The holiday of a Troy that once knew happy times.
Must the Trojans always set their funeral pyre so near this house?
- How long will they accuse me?
- They lost many loved ones, my lady.
Lulled by the promises of peace forever.
I, for one, believe we might have had that peace....
I thought I could escape from it, but there is no place --
Leave me.
Paris commanded me to stay with you while he' s on duty.
Leave me, I tell you.
No, friends!
Hear me, Trojans.
Cast her to the Spartans.
Cast Paris out of Troy.
- If you haven' t the fiber for this....
- Helen, don' t go out.
Their mood is dangerous.
I' ve sent soldiers to disperse them.
- You' ve come to ask me to leave Troy.
- No, Helen.
No.
But for Paris, I would have lost Hector.
I must love my sons equally...... and whomsoever they love.
You are good.
The high priest says that even the gods fight each other.
Some for Athena and Greece, some for Troy and Aphrodite.
How, then, could I blame you for this war?
- I could stop it.
- No one could.
I could...... if I return to the Greeks, to Menelaus.
Go back to someone you so despise?
If it brings an end to war and restores Paris to the love of the Trojans....
- He' d never let you go.
- And could I ever leave him?
- You must help me to decide.
- Would you defy the Fates?
No mortal should attempt so much, Helen.
And yet I wonder...... is one so lovely quite mortal?
No.
I am everything I was determined not to be.
I have only been selfish.
All the despair, the pain and the tears I' ve brought.
How different from that island dream.
Return to your King of Troy...... and tell him we will receive Helen at the appointed place.
But warn him there must be no treachery or deceit.
I assure you, my lord, no deceit exists.
It is her wish to return to King Menelaus.
- It' s her wish.
You hear that, brother?
- I' ve heard it often.
Wait, herald.
Tell your master from Menelaus that we demand --
Nothing else.
Nothing else, only the return of Helen.
The Trojans wish to make peace.
As men of peace, we accept their offer.
Have we suffered to return empty- handed?
Empty- handed, Menelaus?
With Helen returned, integrity satisfied?
You are too outspoken, brother.
When the Trojans have handed over Helen, we' il teach them...... that we' re not easily bought off.
But I' d like Achilles with us, in case they prove troublesome.
He still refuses to fight so long as you' re in command...... and your lovesick jackass of a brother brays upon this beach.
Then he' il get not one obol of Trojan tribute.
Helen?
Helen.
- Where is she?
- She' s not here, Paris.
Where?
She' s gone to the camp of the Greeks.
To Menelaus?
She was determined to end the destruction...... and restore you to the hearts of the Trojans.
- And you conspired with her -- - She was not a captive here, Paris...... but a woman of self- determination, a queen with more courage...... than I would have had to sail against the tides of heaven.
- He shan' t take her.
- The hour has passed, Paris.
You can' t prevent it.
Wait, Trojans.
You' ve returned the wife of Menelaus, but that isn' t all your debt.
Debt?
- We recognize no claim of debt.
- No?
Then who pays for the Greek blood shed on this plain?
Trojan blood has paid in full.
Trojan blood is not valid currency in Sparta...... nor does it pay for launching 1000 ships.
The terms of this truce were clear.
The return of Helen, in exchange for which...... you agreed to sail from these shores.
- You trusting fools.
- Two things only will suffice:
Half the treasury of Troy before we depart...... and after that, 1000 talents every year.
Take these nobles as security!
- To the gates with her!
Bring her back to Troy!
Follow them!
After them!
After them!
Back!
Turn back!
Don' t go too close to the Trojan walls.
Not against Hector.
Patroclus!
Patroclus!
- Bring me my armor.
- Yes, master.
Thank you, Trojan, for bringing us the body of Patroclus.
Thank you very much.
My son, Greek treachery has proved that theirs is not a war of honor.
Helen, through you, we have learned that they seek plunder, not justice.
I ask forgiveness of you both.
Cassandra...... we have found there is great wisdom in you.
- What more can you tell us?
- New storms shall ride the sky...... but the guilt will be Athena' s, not Helen' s.
- Thank you, Cassandra.
- Such courage must not go unrewarded.
Helen, you will be a princess of Troy.
Where is Hector and Andromache?
They are to bestow the laurels.
Where is Hector?
By the Scaean gates, sire.
He anticipates a call to single combat for the death of Patroclus.
Any Greek challenge would come to me.
But Hector didn' t want you to be challenged by Achilles.
- He was devoted to Patroclus.
- Hector sent him his friend' s corpse...... with personal compliments.
No one can match Achilles, not even Hector.
This must not happen.
He cried like an animal in grief, my lord, and then called for his armor.
Ah, so he comes.
Hector!
Hector!
- It is done, Andromache.
- Achilles?
By his hand, my father and my brothers fell.
- While you live, I still have them in you.
- I intend to live, Andromache, for you...... and for our son.
This helmet always frightens him.
Let' s pray that he may never need one...... that he finds peace.
Arms to bear.
If Achilles wins, we move.
To the palace!
And if Achilles dies, we retire to consider a certain plan of mine.
- There' s an immortal shield around him.
- Mighty Zeus, help me find a weakness.
Achilles is dead!
So dies Greek courage, but not Greek cunning.
Defeated by men, deserted by the gods.
I used to number the months by a battle, a pestilence, a famine.
Now it' s all one long nightmare.
I fought wars since most of you were sucklings, but never one like this.
Let' s take our ships and sail back home.
That we shall do.
I have a plan that first required a Trojan victory.
- That much, at least, is accomplished.
- You speak treason.
As you will, but let' s be realistic.
The greatest army on Earth has lost its war.
What are you dreaming, Ulysses?
I' m dreaming of my wife, the good, constant Penelope.
And in my dreams, I see myself returning to her with all the treasures of Troy.
- But how?
- Has this anything to do with the work...... that Apagos and his men have been doing in the woodlands?
They' re building a monument to the triumph of Paris and Helen.
A gift from the goddess Athena.
A sacred horse, so big and so beautiful...... that Troy cannot help taking it to her heart.
Remember, blow the retreat loud enough for Troy to hear.
Let the ships sail but keep sufficient force in the woodlands.
The ships will return at dawn.
Are you sure the Trojans will take this monstrosity into the city?
I promise.
Their gratitude to Athena for her victory will be tremendous.
And they' il give a loving welcome to her wondrous horse.
And to Bacchus, the god of grapes.
Make ready, men of Greece!
First they sounded retreat, and now the call to man the oars.
Their torches are moving back to the sea.
- Aboard the ships?
- We' il soon know.
Lord Aeneas has gone to the shore with scouts.
Sire, they' ve sailed.
The last of their ships has gone to sea.
Sound the cry!
Light the victory torch.
Carry it through the streets.
Good, Priam.
Good.
- Our heroes would wish us to rejoice.
- Light the victory torch!
You' il see a Troy you' ve never known before.
I see it in your faces.
Open it!
Open it!
Let us look at the world again!
The night smiles on us.
Look, Priam.
I was trying to tell you of it, sire.
Some strange monument that the Greeks have left at our doorstep.
Beware the Greeks bearing gifts.
My sister speaks truly.
It is a thing of evil that should be burnt upon the plain.
I agree.
The enemy doesn' t give joyful presents.
My children, this is no gift from the Greeks...... but a symbol of worship they had to abandon.
Sire, the people beg permission to bring this amazing prize into the square.
They have fought long and bravely.
I cannot deny them.
Father, please hear me.
It is not the end of ruin, but the beginning.
We must not be ungrateful...... to a goddess who has proved herself our goddess.
Bring in her sacred horse.
It shall be a monument to Trojan valor.
Yes, sire.
It is a great and perfect thing.
How childish I was to have misgivings.
And I to be afraid of a wooden giant.
What was that for?
Athena.
So forgiving of a rival goddess.
Are you jealous, Aphrodite?
I' m only Helen...... who wonders if she' il ever be a Trojan, really.
When the Trojan people look upon that plain...... won' t they always think of Helen of Sparta?
There is peace everywhere now.
We' re not bound to remain here.
Wherever you wish to go, Helen, I' il take you.
Hail to Prince Paris and his Helen!
Hail to Helen!
- All hail to Paris!
- Hail to Helen!
Destiny, Paris.
Destiny.
There is no escape, it seems.
Not even from happiness.
No, and I am happy.
Very happy.
Men of Sparta!
Men of Sparta, to the palace!
Forward!
Troy is lost, but you must not die.
While the Greeks plunder, make for the north gate.
- Do you think I would leave you now?
- Or I?
Obey your king.
Aeneas, take care of Andromache and my grandson.
Paris, Helen...... I command you, go.
Magnificent leadership, Agamemnon.
Athena will reward you with all the glory.
All of you, break in!
Helen!
Take them!
The rest of you, search!
Find her!
- Don' t let me get lost, Paris.
- Never.
Paris!
Paris!
Paris!
Paris!
Oh, Paris!
Paris!
I thought I was lost!
The gods are with us.
Come.
Paris!
For a moment, I thought...
-... that you were that little slave girl.
- Oh, I am.
Whatever your love wishes me to be, whatever is in your heart.
You are my heart.
Paris.
No.
My ship has returned for you.
Go there.
Wash his blood from you.
That can never be.
It' s my blood.
- I never heard of him.
- Who?
The man you recommended.
The guitar fighter?
Wiped out a couple towns single- handedly.
Yeah.
You heard of him.
You just didn' t know it was him they were talking about.
You should meet him.
Me.
Me.
That' s me.
As Iong as I' m not the guy that has to make the introduction.
Were you in Mexico during the BariIlo carteI massacre?
No.
That' s when I first heard about him.
He was a Iegend.
They used to say he was the biggest Mexican they' d ever seen.
That was totaI buIlshit.
He was 5' 9 ", 5' 1 0", tops.
That' s no record, but bigger than most of us.
But Marquez, that' s a different story.
Marquez.
Marquez.
Gen. Marquez.
Powerful, dangerous.
Marquez, he really had it in for this Mariachi, see.
They called him "Mariachi" because he used to carry this guitar.
A guitar?
Believe me, he reaIly knew how to play it too.
Look, this story is weIl- traveled.
It might have picked up some embeIlishments along the way.
Just read between the Iines.
Now, he may not have been the biggest Mexican ever...
- AII right. -... but she was as deadly...... as she was beautiful.
- There' s a girl?
- Oh, yeah.
There' s a girl.
When he' d run out of ammo, she' d take over.
The most drop- dead gorgeous woman you' II ever see.
That' s where aII the trouble began.
She was with Marquez.
And when Marquez saw that she was with the Mariachi, weIl, he went crazy.
He hunted him down and fought Mariachi to the death.
And then she...... put a buIlet in his heart.
Only he didn' t die.
- I don' t know what happened after that.
- Would you Iike some?
No.
Maybe Marquez caught up with them, or the cartels.
But Iike I said, the man is a myth, a Iegend.
And if he' s stiII Iiving, he' s the one you want.
WeIl...... that is truly unbelievable.
WeIl, I' m not big on teIling stories.
Where' s the money?
That' s the reason I' m here.
I couldn' t find a briefcase smaII enough...... for $1 0, 000 in cash.
It' II do.
Just for my own edification, I offered you 50.
- Why' d you say no?
- I' m not a greedy man.
Not Iooking to get rich quick.
Besides, 50, 000 is a Iot for what you wanted me to find out, you know.
You may as just as weII put a buIlet in my head as cough it up, right?
But 1 0?
Ten thousand is civilized.
Ten is something we both can Iive with.
Ten might stiII be too much.
You' d kiII me over $1 0, 000?
You wouldn' t dare.
You wouldn' t dare.
Yes, I would.
Would you do me the honor?
You need to Iearn to play.
That' s why you' re here.
I hear this is a town of Gunmen.
We only make guitars here.
Mariachi.
Which one?
I don' t know who you mean.
I' m honored to be in your presence.
But there' s someone else who wants to meet you.
Keep it.
He made that for you.
You know, if I was you, son, I' d turn around and go back right now.
Go back to where I came from...... instead of seIling my mind and my souI to these cocksuckers.
You speak English?
I didn' t think so.
Attempts have been made on me and my family by the cartels.
The same cartels that are threatening our freedom... freedom which we must defend to the death.
I present to you Señor Blascoe.
Please sit.
We hear you want to work for us.
I too am ready to start a new Iife.
This is your Iucky day.
Did you order my pibil?
- Does it have a name?
- They caII him "El."
As in "The."
I know what it means.
Thank you.
Alert the BariIlo cartel...... that EI has come out of hiding.
- I don' t think we should -- - Are you a Mexican...... or a Mexi- can' t?
I' m a Mexican.
Good.
Then do as I say.
- Nice tune.
- Something my brother taught me.
I kiIled him.
Yes, I was privy to that information already.
How charming.
You know, El, if I may caII you that...... I' ve been doing a Iittle snooping around, and it seems that the cartels...... have quite a price on your head.
I wouldn' t want to be you.
TeII me, is there anyone who doesn' t want you dead?
You teII me.
I need you to kiII a man.
El, you reaIly must try this because it' s puerco pibil.
It' s a slow- roasted pork, nothing fancy.
It just happens to be my favorite...... and I order it with a tequila and Iime in every dive I go to in this country.
And honestly, that is the best it' s ever been anywhere.
In fact, it' s too good.
It' s so good that when I' m finished, I' II pay my check...... walk straight into the kitchen and shoot the cook.
Because that' s what I do.
I restore the balance to this country.
And that is what I would Iike from you right now.
Help keep the balance by puIling the trigger.
- You want me to shoot the cook?
- No, I' II shoot the cook.
My car' s parked out back anyway.
You...... wiII kiII Marquez.
Do you remember Gen. Marquez?
He' s being paid by BariIlo...... to kiII the president in an attempted coup d' état.
- Attempted?
The president wiII be kiIled...... because he' s that piece of good pork that needs to get balanced out.
I say "attempted" because we don' t want Marquez taking power.
- So why me?
- You' ve got nothing to Iive for...... and, in a way, you' re already dead.
And Marquez is the man who kiIled you.
So why not return the favor?
Go to the church.
And I wiII contact you afterwards if we have a deal.
Was I right?
I guess not.
The Iast shipment of guns that were seized at our border...... have not been accounted for, Sanchez.
You are now off that assignment.
Who wants to volunteer?
Okay.
You, Gomez, it' s yours.
With el presidente' s new campaign against the BariIlo cartel...... their activities are being pushed into the forefront.
Large payments, deliveries, whispers of a politicaI takeover.
I need new point men, strong and wiIling.
This is a top priority of el presidente.
Who wants this?
Romero, it' s yours.
Pick your secondary person.
A third, if you have to.
That' s aIl.
Dismissed.
I should take his Ieft nut.
You' re with us.
People of Culiacan.
I' ve come here to bring you a message of peace.
Peace that at this moment is being threatened by a group of people that is threatening our nation.
People Iike Armando BariIlo.
I invite you to gather our forces...... in order to prevent the destruction of our unity... and our peace.
El presidente, history teaches us no matter how great your armies are...... you wiII always need the favor of the inhabitants...... to take possession of a province.
How can you compete with a man Iike BariIlo?
He owns Culiacan.
He doesn' t own its people.
BariIlo purchased hundreds of homes and ranches...... in the northern part of Culiacan.
And then he has turned around and given these homes to the people.
- He' s a folk hero to them.
- He' s also a mass murderer...... and a drug kingpin.
He' s trying to make himself a martyr by drawing the people to his side...... but the people can see through that.
Men Iike BariIlo have stolen this country' s soul.
But my people wiII stand up for what is right.
I' m afraid they' re no Ionger your people, sir.
Then I wiII die fighting.
Are you with me?
To the death.
What' s wrong?
Everything.
This way!
Come on, come on, come on, come on!
Any suggestions, Miss "Let' s get a room on the fifth floor...... so we can see the beautifuI sunset"?
Jump.
Swing, swing, swing.
- Hang on!
- What do you mean, hold on?
Let go now!
Give me that!
Stop the bus.
Stop the bus.
A vow must be broken.
Forgive me... for what I am about to become.
- When was your Iast confession?
- An hour ago.
- And the name of your priest?
- Sands.
Okay.
You are expected to carry out your assignment to the Ietter --
- Yeah, I know.
- Failure to appear...... in Iocations at assigned times...... results in forfeit of protection, protection you wiII definitely need.
- Yeah.
- You' II be paid.
Coup d' états, Iike elections, don' t come cheap.
So there' s plenty of dough floating around.
There' s more.
You wiII be a free man...... from Marquez, the cartels, and even from the president...... who isn' t your biggest fan, Iet' s face it.
- When do I begin?
- Give me a moment.
It' s a church, hombre.
I' m sorry.
Are you stiII standing?
StiIl.
Good.
Well, the Barillo cartel aren' t the nicest of guys, are they?
However, you' ve passed the test.
You' re gonna do just fine.
Assemble your team, and I wiII caII you with further instructions.
Over and out.
I' m just walking my beat, friend.
Mexico' s my beat, I' m walking it.
I throw shapes, and they catch them.
I set them up and watch them faIl.
Have him meet me at the buIlfight at 5 p. m.
What?
Why would I want that?
Why would I want bubble gum?
AII right.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay, this should hold the both of us over for quite a Iong time.
So I don' t ever want to see you again.
Fuck off.
- Hi.
- HeIlo.
The ClA sharing a meaI with the FBl.
Now, if that isn' t interagency cooperation, I just don' t know what is.
- I' m retired FBl.
- A reaI agent never retires.
He just takes it a Iittle easier.
- Why are we talking?
- You tracked down Armando BariIlo...... for two years when he was running operations out of San Antonio.
Spinning wheels.
It never Ied to an arrest.
WeIl, he --
He is, in fact, sitting directly behind you.
I know.
He settled back in.
He' s been Iiving here for six years.
Can' t be touched.
Did you know that most agents never even see a top- 1 0 criminal...... for their entire careers?
You brought down two, didn' t you?
And now your third is sitting in very close proximity.
Now, retired or not...... that has reaIly got to tug on the old short and curlies.
I' m a civilian now.
Didn' t he kiII that agent friend of yours?
What was his name...... Archuleta?
Yes.
BariIlo is a Mexican citizen.
He cannot be extradited for crimes committed in the U. S.
Do you happen to know of a Dr. Guevera?
Worked for the cartel.
This doctor pumped your friend Archuleta fuII of drugs, day after day...... so that they could torture him for two weeks before he died.
You must have known that.
Dr. Guevera himself having dinner with your prey.
I wonder what it is they' re up to now.
Two weeks of torture, Jorge.
Think about that.
For your dead friend...... for the job you didn' t finish in San Antonio.
Now, are you reaIly going to Iet it slip away again?
I' d Iike you to have a bite of my pork because it' s...... the world.
(Announcer) It' s Mariachi Happy Hour!
Get your Mariachi song for 5 pesos.
A Mariachi kiss for 20 pesos.
And a Mariachi fuck for only 50 pesos!
Where the heII have you been?
Far away.
StiII fucking around?
Let me get Fideo.
I' m here for my guitar.
It' s his Iast night.
They' re firing him.
Hey...... Fideo, it' s me.
- StiII drinking.
- Like a fish.
I guess we haven' t changed so much.
I didn' t think you' d ever come back for this thing.
Neither did I.
Are we on?
I' II Iet you know.
I' II Iet you know.
Bring him sober.
We' re gonna need him, so...... coffee.
Lots of coffee.
Sometimes a revolution is exactly what' s needed to clean up the system.
One...... giant enema, which just so happens to be my area of expertise.
BuII hockey.
Do you Iike this?
The buII is stabbed, prodded, beaten.
The buII is wounded.
The buII is tired before the matador...... ever steps into the ring.
Now, is that victory?
Of course it is.
Wanna know the secret to winning?
Creative sportsmanship.
In other words...
... one has to rig the game.
Go coIlect.
El presidente is giving a speech on the Day of the Dead...... in the town of Culiacan.
He' s going to be isolated...... in the main edificio in the center of the plaza.
Very easy access to him if...... somebody can get you in.
You' re the man who can do that.
I am not the prince.
I am the man behind the prince.
- I see.
- He' s not the first prince I' ve served...... nor the first one that I' ve betrayed.
- You' re a good rat.
- I try.
The rest upon completion.
- Mucho gusto.
- Right.
Right.
Every goddamn time.
What do you want in Iife?
Belini...... how Iong have you and I done business together?
A Iong time.
And in a way...... I kind of, almost, could have the tiniest smidgen of respect for you.
Almost.
But you need to stop farting around.
Now, do you have the information that I need on BariIlo or do you not?
I have what you need.
I' m just enjoying this temporary position of power.
That make you nervous?
You know that withholding vitaI information from a federaI officer...... is a serious offense.
EspeciaIly when that officer has paid handsomely for it...... and wouldn' t think twice about ripping that patch off your eyehole...... and skuIl- fucking you to death.
No.
I' m fine.
Go away.
I am fine.
Go away.
You' re off the hook.
Leave me alone.
That spiII just cost you your Iife.
A Iittle help.
Okay.
I know it' s on you somewhere.
Somewhere.
AII right.
Time to get messy.
WeIl, I suppose I should thank you for not sticking it up your ass.
However.
You' re about a quart Iow.
You' re gonna pay for that, cop.
- Why doesn' t my key work anymore?
- It' s too smaIl.
- Stand back.
- I just -- I brought you a gift.
I' m stiII mad at you.
And trust me, it wasn' t easy to get.
So....
Come closer and I' II thank you.
- Are you trying to give me a boner?
- Closer, I said.
How about that Iittle tip- off?
Guarantees you a big arrest and an accommodation.
Even from your twisted Iittle agency.
I' m impressed.
- But then what?
- Want to hear my plan?
Either that or I start target practice.
Okay.
The new president is on a quest to clear out the BariIlo cartel.
And BariIlo has set up a counterattack...... by hiring a military generaI named Marquez.
He wants him to throw a coup d' état...... while the president' s visiting Culiacan.
Now, I have a man inside as insurance...... to make sure that Marquez never takes power.
The Iast piece of the puzzle...... is BariIlo.
Your tip- off assures...... that Barillo is out of the picture while the battle ensues.
In the aftermath of this very healthy revolution...... I will calmly waltz away with the 20 million pesos...... that Barillo is prepared to pay Marquez for the coup.
- You want me to go with you?
- You detain BariIlo...... with the information that you have, then you join me...... and share the spoils.
You meet me two nights from now...... at La Pileta, 1 0 p. m. sharp...... and bring only what' s important to you.
Oh, yeah.
It might get a wee bit dangerous there, sugar- butt.
So....
- Can you dig it?
- I can dig it.
I want my key back.
Testing.
One, two.
Testing.
HeIlo?
Can you hear me now?
Okay -- Fucking beIls.
Did you assemble your team?
You know I did.
- Why are you having me foIlowed?
- Oh, yeah, that.
Let' s just call that a...... guarantee of compliance, shaII we?
Because Cucuy also...
-... provides protection.
- From what?
Mosquitoes?
Oh, gosh, I really wouldn' t mess with him if I were you...... because he' s a bit of a Iive wire.
And he' s not the happiest that you killed his man.
Oh, yeah, by the way, I have your next assignment.
You the Mariachis?
This is the back entrance.
Make a note of it.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Who are they?
Musicians.
Why so heavy?
Built in amplifier.
Play something.
AII right.
Let' s go.
- I was afraid you couldn' t play.
- Are you kidding?
What we are Iooking for is support from the people of this state.
A man can do a Iot alone, but he can do better with his people backing him.
I wonder how much we' re getting paid for this shit.
A man who wants nothing is invincible, cabrón.
Hey.
Are you gonna teII him that this is his Iast meal?
Is there a particular song you would Iike to hear?
We just played for el presidente, I can' t buy half a tequila with this shit!
It was meant as an honor.
Fuck honor.
- We need money.
- The score' s tomorrow.
Enough for aIl.
Even for you, Lorenzo.
Why are you suddenly interested in the score?
What' s in it for you?
Only revenge.
Much delayed revenge.
Go practice.
Practice?
Playing or shooting?
What do you think?
I don' t think.
I drink.
- Yeah, heIlo.
- Been foIlowing BariIlo...
-... and the good Dr. Guevera.
- Oh, Agent Ramirez, no Ionger retired.
- Good man.
Welcome to the fold.
- I haven' t seen iIlegaI activities yet.
Only that Dr. Guevera is scheduled for a medicaI procedure...... on November 2.
The Day of the Dead.
That' s tomorrow.
Also identified a member of the group as BiIly Chambers.
A fugitive.
We' ve been wanting to pick him up for some time now.
BiIly Chambers?
You sure?
- Bet my badge on it.
- Well...... whatever they' re up to, I can guarantee you...... that it' s going to happen tomorrow.
- So I suggest you -- - What' s going down tomorrow?
If you see an opening, take it.
- What do you know?
- Not enough.
Get inside.
I' ve got nothing.
I gotta get in.
I got nothing.
Try to make a move.
I don' t have a move to make.
What are you gonna do, stupid?
BiIly Chambers is on the move.
Where are you going?
You' re buying a taco.
This is too easy.
Where are the other guys?
This is a setup.
It smeIls Iike a setup.
I' m making my move.
BiIly Chambers.
- WeIl, that depends who' s asking.
- I thought that was you.
- Here, Iet me pay for this.
- Oh, weIl, thanks.
Oh, goddamn it.
- Is that real?
- Yes, it is.
Goddamn.
What took you boys so Iong?
Whoa, hey, friend.
You ain' t gonna need that.
Believe it or not, man, I' m ready to go.
Let' s talk over there.
After you.
Man, I just wanna get out of here.
I' ve been on the run, hiding out here down in Mexico...... for the Iast eight goddamn years.
And I' ve been working for this here carteI for the Iast four.
I ain' t got shit.
AII I got is what I' m wearing on my back.
I can' t go nowhere.
Sort of got me by the baIls, you know?
Jorge Ramirez.
I' II take you in under the FBl' s supervision and protection...... untiI we can take you back, where you wiII be prosecuted for your crimes.
- In the U. S.?
- In the U. S.
The things that I' ve had to do for the goddamn carteI are...
-... unspeakable.
- You don' t know what BariIlo' s up to?
I' m close to the man.
I' m reaI close.
But he don' t Iet nobody in, that cocksucker.
Can you get him close to BariIlo?
Him?
I need your help.
Then you get me out of here.
Then I' II get you out of here.
Him too.
Him too.
There' s carteI on every corner.
Sands told me you handle protection.
I don' t work for Sands anymore.
And since I' m a Mexican, I can do whatever I want.
Then I guess I don' t work for Sands neither.
- Goodbye.
- There' s a price on your head.
I' m going to coIlect.
Why don' t you just teII BariIlo everything you know.
And then maybe he' II just cut off your hands.
And if I don' t?
You know that old man I kiIled in your viIlage?
What if your whole viIlage was next?
Would you kiII them?
Me?
They certainly would.
Then I guess I have no choice...... but to kiII you aIl.
You...... are Iast.
That should put him out for a few days...... and give him some nasty dreams.
You have to relax your fingers.
Music is pure, from one' s soul.
If the souI is pure, the music flows free.
And if the souI isn' t pure?
Then you must practice Iike a motherfucker.
I present to you...... Señor Cucuy.
Get this condescending ass out of here.
You want me to break his fingers?
No.
I want you to chop them off.
- I was just making a joke.
- I wasn' t.
Sit, please.
So...... you are the man who brought us...... the Mariachi.
The man I work for, Mr. Sands...... he is using the Mariachi to kiII Gen. Marquez.
So you want to join us...... here' s how it works.
There is the trade.
A favor for a favor.
So EI Mariachi is the trade?
You are.
This ain' t my Iine of work.
This guy' s aII fucked up.
GeneraI Marquez is arriving!
Bring out the Mariachi!
Bring him out to the General!
I didn' t kiII you before.
Enough blood had been shed.
But I see now... that blood wiII spiII again.
GeneraI Marquez, the Mariachi is not here.
He escaped.
You too wiII escape.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Lore --
Why?
Practice shooting, not drinking.
We are on.
By order of the President, they are searching aII vehicles for guns and drugs.
That fucker' s been blockading aII the roads.
Take us back another way.
By order of the president.
Who does this guy think he is?
He wants to get rid of me?
Fine.
I' il get rid of him.
Replace him, even.
Then I will simply disappear.
Hey, vámonos, man.
Don' t put me out completely.
Have my men wait outside.
BariIlo and Dr. Guevera must already be inside the building...... having entered through the back or basement.
They should be midprocedure.
FederaI agents.
This is going down now.
If BariIlo wanted to Iook unrecognizable to authorities...... he succeeded.
Massive tissue Ioss due to an only partiaIly- completed...... faciaI reconstruction wasn' t necessarily the cause of death.
They switched bodies.
BariIlo!
FBl.
He was anyway.
Bring him along.
Listen, I cannot do everything by myself.
I need someone to go in there with me.
No.
I Iost my inside man.
Probably dead.
And Cucuy, greedy turd that he is, ratted me out and has disappeared.
Plus, I' m pretty sure the carteI is shadowing me.
Now, Iisten, I have got a sweII bunch of guys intercepting Marquez' s army...... but they' ve got no guns.
I want you to understand me.
This is no time to screw the pooch...... because this is supposed to be the big dance number, aII right?
HeIlo?
HeIlo?
Are you there?
Okay, okay, I' m going to freak right out.
I would Iike the puerco pibil and a tequila with Iime.
Yeah, Iisten, I need a new Iine.
This one' s been compromised.
Okay?
Thank you.
I' II be waiting here at the La Vaca Volando.
That' s right.
The Flying Cow.
You reaIly didn' t see it coming, did you?
Sorry, baby, I told you I wasn' t interested in your scheme.
Too smaIl.
Oh, my Christ.
Is that BariIlo?
That' s the new BariIlo.
The old BariIlo died in surgery a few hours ago.
What kind of carteI would have you running its operation?
I' m his daughter.
You' ve been spying on my operation for some time.
I feeI it' s only fair to warn you that kiIling me is crossing the Iine...... and you wiII have every marine from here to Guantánamo Bay...... up your keister, mister.
So just know that.
Fortunately for you, nothing you did is worth dying over.
You have only seen too much.
We are going to make sure that doesn' t happen again.
I offer you a chance for a new Iife.
That sounded a Iittle extreme for a parade.
Troops are coming up from the south.
- Whose?
- Emiliano Marquez.
- WeIl, what do we do?
- We stay here.
This place is fortified.
It' s much easier to defend this place than to chance going out in the open.
Nicholas?
What are you talking about, "fortified"?
Come here!
Just stay clear of those windows, sir.
You Iet me handle it.
My name is Sheldon Jeffrey Sands.
I work for the CentraI InteIligence Agency.
I set them up.
I watch them faIl.
I' m Iiving la vida loca.
No!
I' m terribly sorry about your chewing gum, but Iisten.
I wiII give you this...
... if you' II be my eyes.
It' s a doIlar.
I meant...... this.
I need you to take me to the center of the city.
Is someone foIlowing you?
It' s difficult for me to teII right now because I' m having a bad day.
Do you see someone?
Yes, he' s getting close.
Listen, have you ever seen one of these?
Have you used one?
Don' t ever, because they' re bad.
But what I need for you to do is to aim this...... at the bad man who' s foIlowing us and shoot him in the head.
KiII him?
Oh, yeah.
Very mátalo.
Close?
Okay.
Smoke him.
Smoke the fucker.
Just send him straight to fucking Broadway.
What?
Okay.
Come here.
Right or Ieft?
Was that my right or your right?
Wrong man.
Sorry.
Look me in the eyes...... and then kiII me.
Good boy.
Now you' re thinking.
Take me to the center of the city, where there wiII be even more dough.
For you... for our daughter... for Mexico.
In my past, I' d take on eviI from the bottom.
Now I realize...... start at the top.
The president is a good man.
I' II go around back.
Meet me in five.
Watch him.
We could torture him.
He' s FBl.
He' s retired.
That doesn' t count.
I was tortured once.
I didn' t Iike it.
You know what the fucked up thing is?
They tore out my Ieft nut.
That sort of turned me off of the whole thing.
What should we do with him?
Let' s go eat about it.
Hey Snow White, watch that fucking pig.
Just Iay Iow.
They' II Ieave us alone.
What the fuck?!
I don' t Iike military.
Get out.
- Why are we stopping?
- We can' t go further.
- Why not?
- Look out there.
It' s a coup d' état!
I can' t see, fuck- mook!
I have no eyes.
WeIl, then Iisten to it, fucker!
The military' s throwing over the presidency.
AII heIl' s broken Ioose.
You guys have to get out now.
Keep your money because I' m not moving one inch.
Fuck!
Now what?
- Yeah.
These are much better.
What do you want in Iife?
Good choice.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
Okay, Iet' s go!
It' s no Ionger safe to be here.
Let' s go.
You have a meeting with Gen. Marquez, sir.
It feels Iike you need some protection, sir.
Who are you guys?
Sons of Mexico, sir.
Are we in front of the building?
Okay.
This is it, kid.
I don' t hear you running.
Why would they want me dead?
I' ve done nothing but help them.
What are you talking about?
Let me show you something.
Look out there!
You see?
WeIl, don' t Iook too close, presidente.
But your people are out there fighting for you, you understand?
Take off your jacket.
- This also?
- Yes.
Put this on.
What is this, payoff?
This is money someone paid to kiII you.
And now it' s money to save your Iife, presidente.
Here, get some tequila for yourself.
Leave here and Iock the door.
Carolina?
She died.
Your daughter?
She died.
and you?
Dead.
and I?
Alive and weIl.
In heIl.
Everything in its place...
You fucking Iittle monkey.
Stand up.
See anything you Iike?
No.
Do you remember a man named Archuleta?
Why?
I present to you SpeciaI Agent Jorge Ramirez.
You tortured and murdered Agent Archuleta.
He was my partner.
He was also my friend.
Agent Ramirez, you have to foIlow certain rules.
Oh, I' m retired.
Rules don' t apply to me any more than they do to you.
- Mr. Chambers.
- Yes, sir.
You' re just going to stand there?
I' m afraid anything but standing' s gonna cost you extra.
You Ieave me no choice.
Did you get your man?
One of them.
If that isn' t interagency cooperation, I just don' t know what is.
See you Iater.
Fuck you.
Are you okay?
I don' t know.
You wiII be.
What do you want in Iife?
To be free...
Simple.
No.
What is it that makes a man a man?
Is it his origins, the way things start?
Or is it something else, something harder to describe?
For me, it all began in 1944.
Classified mission off the coast of Scotland.
The Nazis were desperate.
Combining science and black magic...... they intended to upset the balance of the war.
I was 28, already a paranormal advisor to President Roosevelt.
I could never have suspected that what would transpire that night...... would not only affect the course of history...... but change my life forever.
All right, men, let' s go.
Move!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Let' s fan it out.
Your men...... they' il need these.
Are you a Catholic?
Yes.
Among other things.
But that' s hardly the point.
Well, you' re gonna need one of these.
I abhor the use of violence.
Thank you.
I wouldn' t want you to think me mad, Sergeant Whitman.
No, three days too late for that, Professor Broom.
All right, you guys, let' s move, move, move, move!
Come on boys, let' s go!
This way!
Left, right!
Come on, men, let' s get the lead out!
We' re close!
You' re wasting our time.
There' s nothing here but sheep and rocks.
- Ruins, not rocks.
- Hold it right here!
The remains of Trondham Abbey, built on an intersection of ley lines...... the boundaries between our world and the others...
What a load of crap!
Hell, a week ago, I never even heard the word "parabnormal."
Paranormal.
Move it!
Hold the line.
Come on!
Sweet Jesus.
They must be here for the sheep.
The freak in the gas mask...
Karl Ruprecht Kroenen.
Hitler' s top assassin and head of the Thule Occult Society.
If he' s here, this is worse than I thought.
No matter what happens tonight...... this book will guide you back to me.
I will not leave you.
I grant you everlasting life...... youth...... and the power to serve me.
Ilsa!
Grigori!
It' s time.
Five years of research and construction, Grigori.
Five years!
The führer doesn' t look kindly on failure.
There will be no failure, general.
I promised Herr Hitler a miracle.
I' il deliver one.
What I will do tonight can never be undone!
I will open a portal...... and awaken the Ogdru Jahad:
The Seven Gods of Chaos!
Our enemies will be destroyed!
And from the ashes...... a new Eden will arise.
Get down!
I was taking a picture.
You do that again and I' il carve you a new one.
Listen, the portal is open.
Do you understand?
We have to stop them.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Look out!
Get down!
It' s almost over.
No, it' s not.
The portal' s been open for too long.
Something may have come through.
Have your men search the area thoroughly.
Spread out over that way!
Sir!
Something up here!
He' s gone.
For now.
When you said something came through...
From where?
I don' t see them!
Do you really, really believe in hell?
There is a place, a dark place...... where ancient evil slumbers and waits to return.
- Grigori gave us a glance tonight.
- Grigori?
That' s Russian, right?
Grigori Efimovich Rasputin.
Rasputin?
- Come on!
- Occult adviser to the Romanovs.
In 1916, at a dinner in his honor...... he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed...... castrated and finally drowned.
And yet, we saw him here tonight.
Professor Broom.
Careful.
Be careful.
- What the hell is that?
An ape?
- No.
It was red.
Bright red.
Lower your light, you' re scaring it.
- What are you two shooting at?
- A red ape!
No, it' s not an ape.
It' s got a big stone in its hand.
I think that is its hand.
Look at the size of that whammer.
No, wait!
Wait!
A blanket.
Get me a blanket.
Come on.
Come on.
It' s safe.
Jump down.
Come on.
Jump down.
It' s a boy.
It' s just a baby boy.
Move to the left.
There we were, an unready father for an unwanted child.
The boys gave him a name that very night.
In retrospect, perhaps not the most fortunate.
But nevertheless, a name we all came to use.
We called him Hellboy.
Look at the birdie.
Speculation about the origins...
Evidence that Hellboy...
So, what is it exactly that you say this agency does?
I kid you not.
It hunts monsters.
The claim, of course, that this creature...... works for the FBI as a monster hunter.
What you seek is in there.
This is a sacred place.
Give me my gold.
We shouldn' t be here.
Master.
Your eyes.
What did they do to your eyes?
- Have you told him yet?
- No.
We should.
Malignant sarcoma.
In the lungs...... the spine...... liver.
- Approximately...... how long?
- Maybe six weeks.
I can arrange for hospitalization and pain management.
- Make the time more bearable.
- No.
I' d rather be at home.
I have some arrangements to make.
For my son.
You can always get a second opinion.
That won' t be necessary.
Hurry up!
- Hurry up!
- Wait right here!
Tom Manning is the head of special operations at the FBl.
He joins Pat in the studio tonight to go over the latest Hellboy sighting.
There.
That' s the tail.
And these are the horns.
I have a question.
In the pictures of aliens, UFO, the yeti, Hellboy...... why is it they' re always out of focus?
Why don' t you tell us...... about the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense?
I wanna tell you, I wanna tell the American public one thing.
Paranormal Research and Defense.
There is no such thing.
"Waste Management Services"?
What is it?
John Myers, FBl.
Transfer from Quantico.
Look at the birdie, son.
- Hello.
I' m John...
- You are late.
That' s what you are.
- Five minutes.
- Yes, I know.
- I' m going to...
- Section 51.
I know.
Watch your hands and elbows.
- Pardon?
- Watch your hands and elbows.
Hello?
Turn the pages, please, if you don' t mind.
Please.
The pages.
These?
You' re reading these?
Four books at once, every day...... as long as I' m there to turn the pages.
My name' s Broom.
Professor Trevor Broom.
Sir, I' m John...
Agent John T. Myers, Kansas City, '76.
T stands for Thaddeus, mother' s older brother.
Scar on your chin happened when you were 10.
You still wonder if it' s ever going to fade away.
- How did it...?
- He.
Not "it."
Abraham Sapien.
Discovered alive in a secret chamber...... of St. Trinian' s Foundling Hospital, Washington.
His name was taken from this inscription...... stuck to the side of his tank.
- "Icthyo Sapiens.
April 14, 1865. "
The day that Abraham Lincoln died.
Hence, Abe Sapien.
Rotten eggs.
A delicacy.
Abe loves them.
How does he know so much about me?
Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.
"Unique." That' s a word you' il hear frequently around here.
Sir, where am I, exactly?
As you entered the lobby, there was an inscription:
"In the absence of light, darkness prevails."
There are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.
Make no mistake about that.
And we are the ones who bump back.
1937, Hitler joins the Thule Society...... a group of German aristocrats obsessed with the occult.
1938, he acquired the Spear of Longinus...... which pierced the side of Christ.
He who holds it becomes invincible.
Hitler' s power increases tenfold.
1943, President Roosevelt decides to fight back.
The Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense is born.
1958, the Occult Wars finally come to an end...... with the death of Adolf Hitler.
1945, you mean.
Hitler died in '45.
Did he, now?
Myers, this is Agent Clay.
Take his lead.
He' il make the introductions.
You' re not coming?
I handpicked you from a roster of over 70 academy graduates.
Make me proud.
They' re not speaking.
Professor Broom had him grounded.
Grounded?
Who' s grounded?
Okay.
You saw the fish guy, right?
Oh, yeah.
That was weird.
Right.
Well, come on in.
Meet the rest of the family.
He gets fed six times a day.
He' s got a thing for cats.
You' il be his nanny, his keeper, his best friend.
He never goes out unsupervised.
Who?
I hate those comic books.
They never get the eyes right.
Hellboy.
He' s real.
60 years old by our count.
But he doesn' t age like we do.
Think reverse dog years.
He' s barely out of his 20s.
What' s with the hair, Clay?
Finally got them implants, huh?
It' il fill in.
Who' s the squirt?
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
I don' t want him.
What, you get tired of me, Clay?
The candy.
Give him the candy.
Oh, sir, I...
I have these for you.
Father' s back?
- He still angry?
- Well, you did break out.
I wanted to see her.
- Nobody' s business.
- It is.
You got yourself on TV again.
Myers, huh?
You got a first name, Myers?
Try not to stare.
He hates it when people stare.
John.
John Myers.
Well, John' il do.
- Stare at what?
- His horns.
He files them to fit in.
What you looking at, John?
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
Code red.
Hey, hey, hey.
Warning.
Code red.
They' re playing our song.
Come on, champ, let' s go fight some monsters.
We' re here at the Machen Library...... where just hours ago, an alarm was triggered.
The N. Y. P. D. has yet to issue a statement.
You name it.
And now here comes a garbage truck.
A large garbage truck.
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue.
One sheet of glass between them and us.
Story of my life.
Outside.
I could be outside.
You mean, outside with her.
Don' t get psychic with me, fella.
Nothing psychic about it.
You' re easy.
How am I gonna get a girl?
I drive around in a garbage truck.
Liz left us, Red.
Take the hint.
We don' t take hints.
Civilians in bedroom.
Okay, guys, let' s sync up our locators.
Seal the doors.
Red and Blue are coming in.
1900 hours, an alarm was tripped.
A large entity, type 5, reported.
Very aggressive.
Six guards dead.
I thought we checked this place.
Fakes and reproductions.
Apparently, not everything was fake.
Father.
The entity is still in there.
Video surveillance shows a 16th- century statue was destroyed.
St. Dionysius the Areopagite.
- Who wards off demons.
- Exactly.
The statue, however, was hollow.
A reliquary.
A prison.
The Vatican deemed its occupant dangerous enough...... to include it on The List of Avignon, of which, by the way, we hold a copy.
Perfect job for these babies.
Made them myself.
Holy water, clove leaf, silver shavings, white oak.
The works.
Behind this door, a dark entity.
Evil, ancient and hungry.
Oh, well.
Let me go in and say hi.
You better hit the books, Brother Blue.
We' il definitely need more info on this one.
Hey, no one goes with him?
Jesus.
No.
He likes it that way.
The whole "lonely hero" thing.
Hey, Stinky.
Kitchen' s closed.
What you having?
Six library guards, raw, plus belts and boots.
Man, you' re gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out.
Red, I found something.
This entity' s name is Sammael, the desolate one.
Son of Nergal, brother of...
Listen, Sammy...... I' m not a very good shot, but The Samaritan here uses really big bullets.
So, what do you say we work this out in a nice, peaceful...
Oh, crap.
That' s it for you, Sam.
Red, you need to hear the rest of the information.
No, he' s taken care of.
No, listen to this.
"Sammael, the desolate one, lord of the shadows...... son of Nergal, hound of resurrection..."
See...... I don' t like that.
What?
Hound of resurrection?
"Harbinger of pestilence.
Seed of destruc... "
Cut to the end.
How do I kill it?
Doesn' t say.
Go to the front.
Let' s go!
Move!
I' m going around the back.
Oh, crap.
Child.
All grown up, I see.
That voice.
It was the first lullaby you ever heard, my son.
I ushered you into this world.
I alone know your true calling, your true name.
Name this.
- That thing.
That thing.
- What do you think you' re doing?
- What do you think you' re doing?
- Helping you.
Nobody helps me!
It' s my job.
You want to help?
Here.
Load this.
It' s a tracking bullet.
Crack the pin.
Jesus, what' s that on your arm?
Oh, crap.
What the hell is that thing?
Let me go ask.
All right, keep coming.
Good.
Keep coming.
Why, you little...
Wait!
We' re heading toward civilians.
Crazy costumes, huh?
Trick or treat.
Red means stop!
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Stay here.
Sammy, you got a leak.
Waiting for me, chunk- face?
What the...?
- I' m on your side.
- Sure.
That' s right!
Open wide!
Son of a...
Yuck!
Screw this.
I' m fireproof.
You' re not.
Hey, Myers.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Yeah?
How' s your arm?
Yeah, my arm' s fine.
Where are you?
I just fried Stinky.
Listen...... tell Father I' il be home...... but he shouldn' t wait up.
No.
No, wait, wait.
Yeah, I gotta go with you.
- Hey, Myers.
- Yeah?
Bye.
Damn it.
Sammael has fulfilled his destiny.
Die in peace...... and be reborn again and again.
Only seven more days till the eclipse.
The child will be there, and so will we all.
Won' t we?
There' s a big, red man down there.
That' s fine, darling.
Santa' s not here for another month.
Not Santa.
Well, who, then?
I brought beer.
Oh, Red, your arm.
You better get that looked at.
I wanted to see you.
Every time the media gets a look at him, they run to me.
I' m running out of lies, Trevor.
- I thought you like being on TV.
So how many escapes this year alone?
Five.
Tom, he' s our guest, not a prisoner.
Your guest is 6- foot- 5, bright red, has a tail and is government- funded.
I know where to find him.
- I' il get him back.
- Hey, fish stick.
Don' t touch anything.
I need to touch it to see.
- See what?
- Past, future.
Whatever this object holds.
Is he serious?
Don' t worry about fingerprints.
Never had any.
Professor, they were here.
Who was here?
Nixon?
Houdini?
Jimmy Hoffa?
Who?
Show me, Abe.
Show me what happened here.
This is east- wing check- in.
We' re all clear.
Also, make sure it' s all locked up over there in the annex.
Roger that.
Kroenen!
Move.
Move!
There he is!
We' il cover him from here!
All right, don' t move!
Put that down.
Put down the weapon!
Get them.
Drop the weapon.
On the ground!
Last warning!
Take him out!
Now, ready the welcome, my love.
Salt gathered from the tears of a thousand angels.
Restraining the essence...... of Sammael, the hellhound.
The seed of destruction.
This I can promise, Sammael.
For each one of you that falls...... two shall arise.
- Professor.
- I' m all right.
Professor.
You...
You are very sick.
I don' t want Hellboy to know.
Sixty years ago, they tried to destroy the world.
They' re back.
In my lifetime, they' re back...... to finish the job.
We miss you at the bureau.
Abe' s crazier every day.
Father' s still mad at me.
Come back, Liz.
- Come back.
- No.
No, H. B.
No, not this time.
I don' t like it here...... but I haven' t had an episode in months.
And you know what?
I' m learning to control it.
I' m learning where it comes from.
For the first time in my life...... I' m not afraid.
- Looks like your ride is here.
- Have escort stand by.
The Nanny Squad.
Hey, stop.
Wait.
Wait.
Sir, may I go first?
Hang on a minute.
He barely knows him.
Then he should make it his business to change that.
Listen, H. B...... I' ve got a chance out here.
So if you really care about me...
... you won' t come back.
Yeah...... I gotta go too.
Lots to do.
What took you so long?
Come on, time to go home.
Tape you up.
What are you, a Boy Scout?
- Nope, I never was.
- Well, you could have fooled me.
Hey, Red.
Oh, God.
You' ve lost a lot of blood.
This is nothing.
You know what' il kill me, don' t you?
Okay, Red, let' s get you home.
Come on.
You were burned by some organic acid.
I' m lucky that way.
- I worry about you.
- Me?
Well...... I won' t be around forever, you know.
Damn!
Could you please be a little careful?
Big baby.
How long was it latched onto you?
I don' t know.
About five seconds.
- Professor, look.
- Is it bad?
Touched you five seconds, laid three eggs.
Didn' t even buy me a drink.
The stinger detaches itself from the tongue and injects the eggs.
They are very sensitive to heat and light.
They need a humid, dark environment to breed.
Did you ever lose track of him?
Well, let' s see.
There was that moment when I had the train on top of my head.
We can' t risk it.
Tomorrow you' il go back to the tracks with a group of agents.
Search the whole place top to bottom.
Find those eggs and destroy them.
"Elizabeth Sherman."
I don' t like the term "fire- starter."
I just don' t.
And "pyrokinesis" sounds like some psychosis or something.
I don' t know.
Maybe that' s right.
Not being able to let go.
It' s scary.
I black out after each episode.
Sometimes for hours.
You hear about so and so...... who just lost control and just exploded.
Well, they' re lucky it isn' t true.
With me, it is.
My master is calling your name now, my girl.
You must return to the child.
So once again...... dream...... of fire.
Hey, freak!
Get back here, freak!
- Let' s get her!
- Get her!
- Get her, guys!
- Watch this!
Freak!
Oh, no!
Not again.
Oh, no!
Somebody!
Help me!
Help me, somebody!
Help me!
How many buildings does she have to burn down?
She belongs here.
That' s not what she feels.
She may never feel it.
It' s her choice.
Professor, the girl you' re...
Professor, that girl you' re talking about...
Hey, Boy Scout...... think twice.
No, listen, I read her file.
- "Read her file." - She blames herself...... for that explosion in Pittsburgh.
Look, I think I can help.
I could talk to her.
I think I could bring her back.
Just what was it that landed you this job pushing "pamcakes," huh?
What was it?
Punctuality?
The way you part your hair?
What is your area of expertise?
He doesn' t want me with him.
I know that much.
- You' re doing fine.
- No, I' m not.
Look, he respects Clay, not me.
I' m really sorry, okay?
I' m not your guy.
I' m dying, Agent Myers.
Like any father, I worry about him.
In medieval stories, there is often a young knight...... who is inexperienced...... but pure of heart.
- Come on.
Look, I am not pure of heart.
Yes, you are.
Rasputin is back for him.
What I ask of you...... is to have the courage to stand by him when I am gone.
He was born a demon.
Can' t change that.
But you will help him...... in essence...... to become a man.
Pull that down.
She was making great progress...... and now this.
We' il be closed for months.
And it put a big dent in our Thorazine supply.
She' s been like this since it happened.
Are you sure you want to go in?
Miss Sherman?
I' m Agent Myers, FBl.
Miss Sherman?
Can I call you Liz?
It' s a beautiful name.
Sixty percent of all the women in the world are named Liz.
Well, it' s impressive by my standards.
My name' s John.
John T. Myers.
Dr. Broom asked me to invite you back to the bureau.
No special precautions, no security escorts.
Just you and me in a taxi like regular folks.
That doesn' t sound like him.
Well, Miss Sherman, he' s asking you back...... but it' s entirely your choice, you know?
Choice, huh?
That' s cute.
I' ve quit the bureau 13 times.
I always go back.
Where else would I go?
Over here.
You said those eggs need it dark and humid?
Well, they hit the jackpot.
The subway lines, they all converge right around here.
Right below us is the old Vandeveer reservoir.
It was abandoned in the mid- 30s.
There' s a pulse.
There.
A cistern on the other side.
Most of the eggs are there.
There' s no way in.
We should go back and request a special permit, type 2...
You guys coming or what?
We lead a charmed life.
Here you are, doctor.
This should cover your tail fin.
Reliquary.
Straight from the Vatican.
A bone from St. Dionysius.
Looks like a pinkie.
Remind me why I keep doing this.
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
This doesn' t really look like doll' s hair.
Be honest, Red.
What do you think?
I' m thinking about doing it myself.
Hey, you guys find anything?
No eggs yet, Red.
What, are you on a lunch break?
Nothing here.
Red' s on the move.
I' il cover him.
Damn it, Red.
Hey, it' s Abe.
Oh, God.
Bring your toy over here.
Oh, man.
Oh, Jesus.
There' s only one.
I' il fry him quick.
Two.
There were two.
Red?
Red.
Come in, Red.
What' s your 20?
I got no signal.
Where the hell are you?
It' s like Swiss cheese in here.
Sit tight, pal, I' m on him.
Fifteen hundred years ago...... most of Europe had abandoned its old beliefs...... and turned to the Christian faith.
Only in the North did the people hold on to the gods of their ancestors.
The most powerful of these gods was Odin.
He reigned among the stars in Valhalla...... and his ravens gave him wisdom and memory.
But whilst the fire of the ancient powers faded...... a wondrous tale arose that captured the hearts of the people.
It told of a blacksmith who slew a mighty dragon...... and won a legendary treasure.; The dragon gold.
- Where are we going?
- Quick!
My king!
We can' t hold the wall much longer.
Take our son and go.
I' m not leaving you.
Siegfried!
Xanten whelp!
Siegfried.
- My son.
Go!
My brother always watches out for me.
This way, my lady.
What do we do?
We must cross here, my qu ee n.
- Come on.
Get up on here.
Hold on.
Hold on tight.
Hold on.
My son.
A little early for a morning swim, isn' t it?
Who are you, boy?
What happened?
I don' t know.
I can' t remember.
12 YEARS LATER
What do you s ee?
Be patient, child.
Odin' s powers are in the runes.
They never lie...... but they won' t be rushed.
- Don' t k ee p me waiting.
Fire will rain down from the sky very soon.
Tell me more.
And the light of that fire will reveal your destiny.
So far from home.
What destiny could I have here?
After the fire, a man will come...... a man as strong as you.
The warrior' s strength will match your own.
He will even best you in battle.
No one' s ever done that before.
No one else ever will.
We should anchor for the night soon.
You work on this.
All right.
Gr ee tings.
How can I help you?
We' re looking for Eyvind the blacksmith.
That' s me.
They say your iron is the best around.
What can I do for you?
What swords have you got?
Well, right now, nothing at all.
I can s ee a lot of "nothing" right there inside.
They were made for King Gunther of Burgund.
Well, he' s not here, and we are.
Meaning that you plan to steal King Gunther' s property?
"Stealing," he says.
Just count yourself lucky we aren' t offended.
Eric, I think your iron is getting cold.
Good day to you.
I don' t like Saxons.
I do, once in a while.
For sword practice.
Look at that pale path of light.
That' s the road to Valhalla.
I wish I could s ee them sitting up there.
All the great heroes at table with the gods.
- And they' re watching over us mortals.
- But why do they care about us?
They n ee d us just as much as we n ee d them.
We' il fight on their side when the evil powers attack us.
But how do we know what they want us to do?
They map out our destinies.
They' ve given you all the signs in the sky.
They get furious.
The Christians say their god is all about forgiveness.
The Christians?
They are a strange lot.
Look.
It' s Ragnarök.
The gods go to war.
- I wanna take a closer look.
Don' t go.
Never.
You' re the woman from the longship.
And you' re the man from the smithy.
A tamer of fire and the elements.
Then maybe you can tell me what this is.
Some kind of strange metal.
I' ve never s ee n its like before.
Imagine the weapon one might forge from it.
- Is this metal the reason you came?
- No.
You are.
Never mind him, blacksmith.
Tell me something.
Why?
We were both sent a sign that would bring us together here.
That sign was big enough for the whole country to s ee.
The only ones here are you and me.
Today the runes promised...... to lead me to a man whose strength would be as great as mine.
And you defeated me.
I just wrestled you down.
No one has ever done that before.
Until now.
So you s ee, we were meant to m ee t.
- Why don' t you stay here with me?
- Oh, Eric, I would love to.
But like you, I have duties to perform.
But I will wait for you.
But where will I find you?
Iceland.
But there might be more than just one Brunhild in Iceland.
Not more than one who is qu ee n.
Yes.
Does that make a difference?
No.
- Not to how I f ee l about you.
- Good.
Because no matter what happens, I will love you forever.
I promise I will come.
Well, the gods wanted it to happen.
But I' m a blacksmith, and she is a qu ee n.
Up North are many tales about blacksmiths who became kings.
Really?
There have always b ee n things that were different about you.
Maybe she felt them too.
Father, take me with you on your journey to Burgund this year.
Why?
Maybe the river holds an answer to what happened before you found me.
You were never curious about that before.
It never really mattered before.
Maybe last night changed you.
I don' t know anything about myself.
I' ve never even left the smithy.
And now I f ee l I must.
Let' s get the boat ready.
We' il leave tomorrow morning.
Thank you.
Thank you, Father.
What' s that?
Is it a war?
It sure looks like that.
But who' s the enemy?
King Gunther is at peace with the Saxons.
Up here.
- Alberich.
- Lord Hagen.
I s ee you have not changed.
Nor have you.
I got your message.
What is it you want now?
Fafnir the dragon is awake.
You must convince King Gunther to gather his best warriors and kill Fafnir.
Why would I put their lives at risk, and mine?
I don' t care about the dragon.
You wouldn' t say that if you knew what was hidden in his cave.
Go on.
The ancient treasure hoard of the Nibelungs.
You' ve b ee n babbling about that...... ever since they cast you out for trying to thieve it.
Now you want me to believe the hoard is here?
The dragon was sl ee ping on it.
So you' ve wasted years of the mortal life they cursed you with...... and the treasure was under your nose the whole while.
That' s funny.
You won' t laugh so hard when you' ve s ee n it.
You' ve never dreamed of such a hoard of gold and jewels.
Why would I help you and not k ee p the whole hoard for myself?
We know each other too well, you and I.
Some of my blood courses through your veins.
Don' t ever dare to speak of it.
You know it' s true.
Hold your tongue!
I know that you' re ashamed of where you come from.
But remember how many times I' ve helped you with my magic.
We could help each other now.
Very well.
I' il choose the best of the king' s men.
Move fast.
There again, why do things by half?
- All right, Kriemhild, let it go.
Go.
So much for the pigeon.
I n ee d to work on that bird' s hunting technique.
If he ever comes back.
Good to s ee you.
Good to s ee you, my friend.
There he is.
Of course.
He knows I' m his lord and master.
Very well, lord and master, go get him back.
What a beautiful bird.
- Give him back.
He belongs to me.
- What' s its name?
Arminius.
Like the hero who chased the Romans out of the country.
Yes, now give him back to me, boy.
Who are you calling a boy, boy?
I' m the king' s brother, and I call common men what I please.
Did you hear that?
What?
What' s that?
He says I' m no common man, but the tamer of fire and the elements.
And that' s what you should call me.
Shall we try again?
Stop that nonsense, Eric.
Give back the hawk to Prince Giselher.
At once.
I hoped you wouldn' t give up so easily.
I' il get you a new one.
- Eyvind.
- Oh, Lord Dankwart.
We' ve b ee n waiting for you.
I' m glad you got here safely.
We saw the devastation coming up the river.
It' s a dragon.
Fafnir, they call it.
The monster came out of nowhere and started killing, destroying everything.
- Yeah.
Thank you.
Now, look at this.
This is even better.
You have a good eye for blades, my king.
Forged and tempered by my son here.
It' s well- balanced in order to make it move like an extension of your arm.
- You' ve learned your craft well.
- Thank you, my king.
I' ve always said there' s no better weapon- maker in the land.
I n ee d your best iron to help my men fight the dragon.
Brother, with this sword I could fight the dragon at your side.
- Let me come with you.
- You know my answer, Giselher.
It is not wise to put two princes of Burgund in danger at the same time.
You handle it very well, Prince Giselher.
The balance is perfect for you.
It' s yours.
A simple gift.
Thank you.
The creature should be hunted down.
I, too, ask to join your quest against the dragon.
That task is only for warriors most honoured and favoured by the king.
Please excuse his impetuous youth, my king.
I know exactly how you f ee l.
What did you think, Eric?
The king would be waiting for you to kill the dragon for him?
I can do it.
With your mouth you can.
Make sure it reaches the right temperature.
Aren' t you helping me with this?
It' s your sword.
Didn' t I teach you how to do it?
Yes, you did.
Then do it.
I will love you forever.
To the forest of Fafnir.
May God be with us, and grant us swift victory.
Open the gates.
Don' t stare at the princess.
It' s not polite.
I' m not staring.
She is, though.
Tamer of fire and the elements...... may I enter?
- You may.
And please do call me Eric.
I' m Prince Giselher.
Well, would you care to pump the bellows, prince?
Thank you.
I came to thank your father for the sword.
I neglected to do so earlier.
But I' il let him know you stopped by.
I' ve never met a blacksmith who knows how to use the sword so well.
Father says you can' t forge a sword if you don' t know how to use one.
- It' s good to have a father like that.
- What about your father?
My father was killed in a battle years ago.
My mother died soon after.
How do you know when the iron' s ready?
The f ee l.
The way it looks.
This one will n ee d hammering for days.
It must be wonderful to make things with your hands.
Do you have a talent or a craft?
I' m not allowed to work.
It would disgrace my brother, the king.
- Don' t you get bored?
- Yes.
If it weren' t for my sister, I' d go mad.
She' s quite a pretty girl.
She doesn' t want any of them.
Who does she want then?
Are you smitten by her too?
My heart is elsewhere.
I just hope my brother is able to kill the dragon.
The king!
The king is returning!
Gunther!
Gunther!
The dragon' s hide was hard as iron.
Our weapons were useless against it.
Take him in.
Careful.
He will be avenged, my lady.
I swear it.
This is your masterpiece, my son.
What will you call him?
I don' t know.
Why?
A sword as great as this des erve s a name.
Then I shall call you "Balmung."
Balmung?
Balmung was the sword of the last King of Xanten, destroyed in battle.
Why do you want to call him that?
I just like the sound of it.
Fafnir!
Come out!
Come out, you worm!
Fafnir, I' m right here!
That' s it.
Come out!
Come on!
Blood...
Bathe in the dragon blood.
In the dragon blood.
Bathe in the dragon blood.
If you are wise, you will leave empty- handed.
This gold is not for humankind.
It belongs to us.
I think it belonged to the dragon.
We are the k ee pers of the gold.
Gold that only we can hold.
The hoard was ours till Fafnir stole it from us.
H ee d our warning, or you too will pay.
Who are you?
The Nibelungs.
The people of mist and twilight.
You gave the gold back to us by slaying Fafnir.
And we thank you for it.
Thanks are all very well.
But I' m the one who risked my life to kill the dragon.
That should be worth something.
It is not worth a single coin of this treasure.
Not when it comes with a curse.
- I don' t believe in curses.
- The proof is outside.
Fafnir lies dead because of it.
I think he lies dead because of me.
And what' s this?
That is the ring of the Nibelung.
The oldest thing in the hoard.
Its heart.
The one who possesses it is the treasure' s owner.
- It' s beautiful.
- And as deadly to you...... as anything else here.
It' s gonna take more than just words to frighten me today.
I' il be back for it soon.
When the curse begins to bite, beware...... for it will find your weakness, and through it, destroy you.
- What sorcery is this?
- Give it back.
Who are you?
- What?
It' s made your skin impenetrable.
I killed the dragon.
What' s to stop me from killing you?
The magical Tarnhelm.
You can k ee p it.
It made me take your shape.
What do I n ee d that for?
I look like me already.
Yes, but with it, you can wear any shape you desire.
- Prove it.
- Put it on your head.
Listen, are you trying to...?
You must say the magical words:
Shadows and vapours, all the same.
And you must think who it is you want to turn into.
Shadows and vapours, all the same.
You look really ugly.
Then I must look like you.
Are you going to spare me?
Go.
Another mistake, young mortal.
Now you also own his enmity.
- And the curse.
- Why?
Who is he?
His name is Alberich, and he was one of us.
But gr ee d awoke in Alberich.
He wanted the treasure all for himself, like you.
When he tried to steal it...... we cast him out, and stripped his immortality away.
How about we make a bargain?
Would that be fair?
Half the treasure, all the treasure, or just that single ring.
It' s enough to bring the whole curse down on you.
It' s all mine now.
Lady, you set tests for your suitors.
Such tests are almost an insult to their rank.
These men who ask for your hand are royal kings and princes.
And I am a qu ee n, their equal.
I have a right in my own land to make whatever laws I please.
- Then tell them...... that the Qu ee n of Iceland will wed the man who passes the tests she sets.
And who can defeat her in single combat.
But no man can hope to succ ee d at such tasks, majesty.
And one man will marry me.
And I will know that man as soon as I s ee him.
You may go.
You are thinking of the man you met on the night the star fell, aren' t you?
The blacksmith?
I have thought of that man ever since.
And I will marry no one else, Hallbera.
Not a prince, not a king, not the Roman emperor himself.
And if your handsome sword- maker does appear, what then?
Are you sure he' s strong and brave enough to pass the tests you planned?
He has defeated me once already.
Only he will defeat me again.
The rune stones do not lie.
It' s Eric.
- Hunting.
Any luck?
- What is it?
- What does it look like?
It' s a dragon' s claw.
- Where did you find it?
- On a dragon' s foot.
You think you can fool your own father?
If you don' t like its claw, how about...... its head?
I don' t believe it.
It really is the dragon!
It' s wonderful.
Fafnir is dead!
Eric the blacksmith killed the dragon!
Yes, he' s dead, do you hear?
The dragon is dead!
Eric killed the dragon!
It' s true!
It' s over, it' s over!
Please, I' m fine.
Gunther.
Eric killed the dragon, alone.
This blacksmith must be blessed by God.
Or the devil.
He succ ee ded where you and 12 of your best warriors failed.
Whatever power he used against the dragon, he could use against you.
He did this for me.
Open your eyes, Hagen, and let your suspicious mind have a holiday.
People of Burgund.
I command that Eric the blacksmith be proclaimed a hero of the kingdom.
Long may he be honoured for his great victory.
Long live the dragon slayer.
Even the honour of guarding such a treasure...... would bring fame to Burgund, my lord.
And respect for its king will increase beyond measure...... once it' s known that you have b ee n entrusted with the safety of the hoard.
- My king, the dragon slayer' s outside.
- Send him in.
It sounds most attractive, Hagen.
But all of these benefits depend upon...... what our young hero has to say.
King Gunther, I am greatly honoured by your offer to hold the treasure...... in safek ee ping for me, but...
- You don' t trust the king?
I trusted him well enough to kill a dragon on his behalf, Lord Hagen.
Did you?
That was a fair hit, Hagen.
Now, Eric, the word "but" usually means some difficulty.
My king.
It' s only I' m not sure your treasury has enough room.
- Can I s ee your face?
- No, that would ruin everything.
He' s my only son.
I brought him up all by myself.
The father of our saviour.
I' m also a sword- maker, favoured by the king.
And still a pagan.
The hammer of Thor, the god of thunder.
The workingman' s god and my god.
- You' re baptized?
- Yes.
But tonight, I' m pagan again.
Let' s go get some water.
What does a dragon slayer do now that there are no dragons left to slay?
He goes home to his smithy.
With all the gold you brought back, you don' t n ee d to work.
My father taught me the art of changing charcoal and ore into iron...... and I enjoy doing it.
Defeat dragons with iron, but win maidens with gold.
How many?
One?
Two?
A dozen?
None.
My heart is pledged already.
Who is this fortunate lady?
Highborn or low?
High, I think.
Or fear.
Maybe too high.
Perhaps she doesn' t know you love her so d ee ply.
All sorts of arrangements might be made for so great a hero.
- Would I know her?
- No.
She lives far away.
So to whom is your heart pledged?
- Are you married?
- No, I' m not.
If I ever marry, it will only be for love.
Will you finally come to me?
I' m waiting for you, my love.
Do you know who you are at last?
They call me Eric the blacksmith, Eric the dragon slayer...... and Eric the hero of Burgund.
Ah, but these are just titles.
One honest, one honoured, one honourable.
But none of them are who you really are.
The Twin Kings have struck at Odinwood.
They' ve burned our towns and taken our people as slaves.
Even as we speak, Bonna is under siege.
Damn them.
Damn them both.
We' ve lived in peace with the Twin Kings for ten years.
But for most of those ten years...... Burgund' s treasury hasn' t b ee n filled to overflowing with Fafnir' s hoard.
Gr ee d will negate any treaty.
How strong is their army?
- Four, perhaps, 5000 men.
- We can match them in strength.
But they' re on the move.
Send messengers to all our towns.
We leave at once.
But my king...... Eric the blacksmith owes you no allegiance.
If he agr ee d to join our army...... I' m certain it would encourage our warriors.
And discourage the enemy.
To m ee t a man who slew a dragon single - handed...... would give anyone a pause for thought.
Command...
No, ask that he ride with the Burgund host.
- Brother, I...
- I honour your intention...... but this is not about glory.
If we don' t come back, you must live to defend Burgund.
And your sister.
Meanwhile...... we ride.
Go.
King of the Burgunds, my masters, Kings Thorkwin and Thorkilt...... do not wish for this battle.
Since we outnumber you, I believe that.
We will spare your lives, and spare Burgund its certain devastation...... if you yield up to us the dragon gold.
I am the wrong man to ask for the gold.
If your masters want the gold...... they must take it up with the man who slew the dragon.
- Let me talk to them, my king.
- No.
I will never allow this.
- We will fight them together.
- It is my treasure, my king.
And I f ee l enough blood' s b ee n spilled over it already.
My king, if the dragon slayer can help avoid more bloodshed...... then let him.
If he fails, we attack.
Another messenger.
I hear you want something of mine.
I' m the lord of the dragon' s gold.
If you want it, you' re welcome to try to take it.
But you have to fight me first.
Big words for a blacksmith.
It takes more than gold to make a man worthy to fight a king.
And it takes more than a crown to make a man be a king.
You' re nothing more than a Burgund whelp.
Xanten whelp!
You killed my father!
I am Siegfried, son of Siegmund, King of Xanten.
You' re beaten.
And your kingdoms will be divided...... betw ee n the Kings of Burgund and Xanten.
I should kill you both for what you did.
But that wouldn' t give me any satisfaction.
Just get out of my sight.
I want him tied to the house of Burgund forever.
What do you have in mind, my king?
My sister will marry Siegfried of Xanten.
And I' m sure you will not find this too difficult to arrange.
Go now!
Father, I' m awakened at last.
I finally know who I am.
And worthy, I hope, of a qu ee n.
Come to Iceland, my love, and find out.
Soon, my love.
But I' ve won a mighty treasure, and I wanna bring it home for you.
Siegfried, you are the only treasure that I wish for.
Hurry, my love, I' m waiting.
And now you send for me.
What do you want?
Siegfried means to take the treasure to his father' s castle in Xanten.
He must be stopped.
From what I hear, a whole army couldn' t stop him.
But there' s some other woman.
What do you have in mind?
One of your cantrips, spells or potions.
If he could forget his other love and find the princess attractive instead?
Then the gold stays where it is.
I think I can help you...... if the price is right.
- What do you want?
That boy took something from me.
It looks like a mask.
The man who knows its secret can look like anyone else.
- Siegfried knows that secret.
- Interesting.
Get me the Tarnhelm back, and the potion' s yours.
The potion first, thief.
Once I have proof that it works, you' il get your Tarnhelm.
You' il have it the day after tomorrow, my son.
Don' t ever call me that.
But my son you are.
If killing you could change it, I would' ve done so long ago.
Sweet memories dwindle, the heart grows cold.
Past love a memory, withered and old.
As the moon wanes, the heart wanders.
Father?
Father.
Father.
What' s the matter?
Are you sick?
If old age is a sickness, yes.
You' ve just b ee n working for a long time.
But there' s no n ee d to work anymore.
There' s all the gold we ever n ee d.
Don' t tempt me with gold, son.
Iron is my metal.
You' re just tired, Father, that' s all.
I' il get you something to eat.
"Father."
Can you still call me that?
Your true father was a king.
You knew?
I suspected it.
I saw the mark of the royal house on your tunic.
And later I learned that the Twin Kings were looking for the lost son...... but never found him.
Because you gave me another name to protect me.
It would be a lie to say that that was the only reason.
You s ee, I never had a wife.
But with you, I got a son.
And...
And it was such a joy to be a father.
Your father.
And I' ve always b ee n proud of you.
I wanted you to know that.
And whatever I am, it' s because of what you taught me.
The world around us is in the throes of great change.
And the new powers struggle with the old for domination.
And I' ve done my part in that struggle.
So when my time comes...... my body can descend to the gods in the old way...... the way of fire and water.
But you and your qu ee n are children of the old world too.
The gods gave you wondrous powers...... and you must fulfil your destiny together...... wherever it leads you.
I' il bring my love with me to Xanten as my wife.
I promise you.
But you' re gonna come with me.
I have no more travelling left in me.
I have hardly even breath anymore.
There' s still so much for you to do.
So many swords to make.
My best blade is forged.
There' s no n ee d to bother with lesser ones.
My throat is dry, son.
That drink you said you were going to get me, I could use that now.
Of course, Father.
I' il be right back.
Father?
Father!
Beasts die...... and men die.
All who walk the earth must die.
But the true hero never dies.
In our memory he will live forever.
My love.
So near to my heart and my mind.
Yet so far from my arms and my body.
How much longer?
How much farther?
Yes?
My lady Kriemhild.
May I please speak with you?
I wish to be alone, Lord Hagen.
It' s about Siegfried.
What about him?
I expect him back any day.
Of course he will come back, for the treasure.
And not because of you?
What are you implying, Hagen?
I have noticed you have f ee lings for him.
You speak of matters you know nothing about.
I know, my Lady Kriemhild...... that you have loved the dragon slayer since the first moment you saw him.
And I have come here to help you.
Once the treasure is gone, there is nothing to k ee p him here.
- What is that?
- Certain herbs...... with interesting properties.
Which, if correctly brewed, will make a heart grow warm.
That is wrong.
That is no Christian thing.
It is the old magic of spells and curses.
All he must do is to drink this mixed with wine...... and so long as it is you who gives him the cup...... any love for any other woman will be forgotten.
And only you will burn in his heart from that moment on.
But why?
In battle and in council...... I have always s erve d the house of Burgund...... and the best interests of the kingdom.
IN THE STORY SO FAR...
- My son.
- Go now.
Who are you, boy?
What happened?
I can' t remember.
Fire will rain down from the sky very soon.
After the fire, a man will come.
The warrior' s strength will match your own.
He will even best you in battle.
Do you believe in destiny?
We were meant to m ee t.
- You' re the Queen of Iceland?
- Yes.
Does that mak e a difference?
No.
Not to how I f ee l about you.
I will love you forever.
- Don' t stare at the princess.
- I' m not staring.
She is, though.
Lord Hagen.
Fafnir the dragon is awake.
You must convince King Gunther to gather his best warriors and kill Fafnir.
I ask to join your quest against the dragon.
That task is only for warriors most honoured and favoured by the king.
To the forest of Fafnir.
The dragon' s hide was hard as iron.
Our weapons were useless against it.
He will be avenged, my lady.
I swear it.
This gold is not for humankind.
It belongs to us.
That is the ring of the Nibelung.
The oldest thing in the hoard.
The one who possesses it is the treasure' s owner.
It comes with a curse.
Fafnir lies dead because of it.
Heed our warning, or you too will pay.
- What sorcery is this?
- The magical Tarnhelm.
With it, you can wear any shape you desire.
His name is Alberich, and he was one of us.
But greed awok e in Alberich.
He wanted the treasure for himself.
- Like you.
- It' s all mine now.
Eric the blacksmith killed the dragon!
Fafnir is dead!
I command that Eric the blacksmith be proclaimed a hero of the kingdom.
Even the honour of guarding such a treasure...... would bring fame to Burgund...... once it' s known that you have b ee n entrusted with the safety of the hoard.
Defeat dragons with iron, but win maidens with gold.
My heart is pledged already.
- Would I know her?
- No.
She lives far away.
And I will marry no one else, Hallbera.
Not a prince, not a king, not the Roman emperor himself.
I' il bring my love with me to Xanten as my wife.
- But you' re gonna come with me.
- I have no more travelling left in me.
I have hardly even breath anymore.
They call me Eric the blacksmith, Eric the dragon slayer...... and Eric the hero of Burgund.
I am Siegfried.
Son of Siegmund, King of Xanten.
You' re beaten.
Your kingdoms will be divided...... betw ee n the kings of Burgund and Xanten.
I want him tied to the house of Burgund forever.
My sister will marry Siegfried of Xanten.
And I' m sure you will not find this too difficult to arrange.
- What do you have in mind?
- One of your cantrips...... spells or potions.
If he could forget his other love and find the princess attractive instead?
Then the gold stays where it is.
So near to my heart and my mind.
Yet so far from my arms and my body.
How much longer?
How much farther?
All he must do is to drink this mixed with wine...... and so long as it is you who gives him the cup...... any love for any other woman will be forgotten.
And only you will burn in his heart from that moment on.
Fifteen hundred years ago...... most of Europe had abandoned its old beliefs...... and turned to the Christian faith.
Only in the North did the people hold on to the gods of their ancestors.
The most powerful of these gods was Odin.
He reigned among the stars in Valhalla...... and his ravens gave him wisdom and memory.
But whilst the fire of the ancient powers faded...... a wondrous tale arose that captured the hearts of the people.
It told of a blacksmith who slew a mighty dragon...... and won a legendary treasure.; The dragon gold.
King Siegfried of Xanten.
I came to thank you for your hospitality.
You are always welcome.
I know that the treasure has brought your kingdom...... misfortune and bloodshed, and for that, I apologize.
Please, Siegfried.
Many wars are fought over gold and treasure.
No army ever waged war with a hero such as you among them.
You didn' t destroy lives, you saved them.
You have done the kingdom of Burgund a great service.
- Thank you, my king.
- King Siegfried.
Would you join us in a toast before you leave?
This is a special wine of Burgund...... mixed with spices.
To Siegfried of Xanten.
To the hero who arrived a blacksmith...... and leaves a king.
- King Siegfried of Xanten.
Good wine.
Though the spices give it a strange flavour.
Where are Gunther and Hagen?
They left.
Will you make it again for me sometime...... only with less cinnamon?
Of course I will.
What?
At the dragon feast...... you told a masked girl that your heart was already pledged to somebody else.
So it was you.
Forgive me.
I couldn' t say anything because...
Please...... it doesn' t matter...
... because I love you.
I don' t know why it never occurred...
Nothing matters now.
Except that you love me.
And I love you.
Where might my raven be?
I' m proud that Burgund has won you as brother - in- law.
Nobody could bring more honour to our kingdom than you, Siegfried of Xanten.
I want to make your sister my qu ee n before I return to my kingdom.
Unfortunately, in our kingdom...... the law decr ee s that the king must marry before any of his siblings.
How long do we have to wait then?
It' s not that simple.
The qu ee n I desire is a beautiful and powerful woman...... who challenges her suitors to single combat.
Till now, nobody has proved strong enough to defeat her.
- And who is this powerful woman?
- Her name' s Brunhild, Qu ee n of Iceland.
I' ve met her once.
You know her?
Yes.
Her ship sailed by our smithy one day.
How could I forget?
She is of extraordinary beauty.
You said you' ve met her?
I did.
That night a star fell from the sky into the forest near our smithy...... and we met by the crater it made, and we fought.
But why?
I mistook her for a Saxon and wrestled her down.
You mistook the Qu ee n of Iceland for a Saxon?
How did she react?
She was a little surprised, that' s all.
Siegfried...... she is the woman I wish to marry.
Would you help me win her for Burgund' s qu ee n?
How?
By fighting her in my stead.
Wouldn' t she notice?
Not if you wear that magic helmet of yours.
- These powers shouldn' t be misused.
- You' re the man who could defeat her.
King Gunther has given you his only sister in marriage.
Will you not help him win a qu ee n for himself?
Think, Siegfried.
If Brunhild and I marry...... you and Kriemhild can be married the very same day.
I knew what the wagons were carrying when they came...... but I had no idea it could look so beautiful.
It' s yours.
Mine?
The treasure is my wedding gift to you.
But this ring...... is the symbol of our love.
Wear it till I come back from Iceland.
Every day without you will be an eternity.
Come back soon.
And bring my brother back safely.
My king, we found a stowaway hidden amongst the stores.
- Throw him over the side.
- I think you should s ee him first.
Giselher, are you insane?
I only wanted to s ee the Norse women, the great Valkyries who fight like men.
Why, Giselher?
Do you want a warrior woman of your own?
Why didn' t you ask me?
I always ask you, and you always turn me down.
Your place is at home, looking after Burgund.
- Besides, Kriemhild will be worried.
- Kriemhild knows.
I' ve half a mind to send you back in a barrel!
Oh, come on, Gunther.
What boy doesn' t crave an adventure like this?
Sit down.
And those are the Seven Silver Apples of the goddess of youth.
- You know a lot.
- Not as much as my father, Eyvind, did.
S ee over there?
That' s Orwandil, the Giant.
And next to it is Fearr, the bull that he hunts.
And s ee there?
That' s the Spirits' Road, the bright road to Valhalla.
The gods sit up there with the holy dead...... and decide what we should do to help them save the world.
How are we supposed to find out what they want us to do?
They send us signs.
In water...... fire, or in the sky.
What happens if we read those signs wrong?
I don' t know.
He' s coming.
Your future husband is coming.
Siegfried.
- Captain, hoist the mainsail.
- Yes, my king.
Raise the sail!
Qu ee n Brunhild, come quickly.
Welcome to my country, tamer of the fire and the elements.
At last you found your way to me.
The dragon slayer' s fame reaches even here.
It is not I who come to challenge you, great qu ee n.
It is King Gunther of Burgund...... who s ee ks your hand.
I only s erve him.
My qu ee n...... I come here to s ee k your hand in marriage.
We will fight a duel of double - bladed axes.
If you win...... I will wed you.
If I win...... it will cost you your life.
If I fail to make you my wife...... I will die gladly.
The contest commences in one hour.
Giselher, let' s wait outside.
Shadows and vapours, all the same.
Just stay hidden until it' s done.
What about Siegfried?
He' il follow us later.
The dragon slayer doesn' t join you?
He' s already preparing the ship for our return.
The axes.
You can still sail back to Burgund alive.
There!
Come on!
Here!
Come on!
Bow to my future husband...... the King of Burgund.
Now the King of Iceland.
Leave until I call you and close the door.
They make no sense, lady.
Look there.
That means a cloak or a mask.
Something or someone has b ee n hidden...... the way truth is hidden by lies, our eyes are covered by a blindfold.
Is that why Siegfried didn' t recognize me?
There is nothing here.
The gods are silent.
Noble Siegfried...... ever since you came to Burgund in the guise of a humble blacksmith...... many good things have happened in our kingdom.
Around this table are the two men I love most in the world.
Giselher is my brother by birth.
And it would please me...... if you would become our brother by blood.
The dragon' s blood made my skin impenetrable.
But I guess tonight is a night for trust.
This...... is the only place where I can be wounded.
And now both of you share the greatest secret I have.
This cup will hold no lesser drink than the blood of brotherhood.
It will be raised in no lesser toast.
And may those who betray that trust die, dishonoured and accursed.
People of Burgund!
Your qu ee n!
I present my sister, Kriemhild.
I' il be a sister to you as well.
We will celebrate two weddings on one day.
Where' s my Tarnhelm?
We' re not done with it yet.
You can have it in due course.
That wasn' t the deal, Hagen.
- We' re not sure if it worked.
- It worked!
It worked!
Now you' re trying to cheat me!
Perhaps I should find a way to have a little talk with the king.
No n ee d for that.
I' il do it!
Qu ee n Brunhild.
- Can I help you?
- I waited for you.
As I said I would.
Siegfried...... what happened?
Did you find you couldn' t love a qu ee n as well as you did a passing stranger?
Or was it the gold?
That has turned many hearts cold before.
I don' t know.
Who shall I ask why you loved me then, and you don' t love me now?
I didn' t.
Don' t lie to me.
You cannot claim you didn' t love me then.
It was your first time, blacksmith.
And mine as well.
And I knew then that the gods had sent you to me...... and me to you.
And you knew it too.
Does that mean nothing?
That' s not how I remember it.
And you never...... loved me?
Even though you said you did?
I was a boy then.
If this is what manhood brings...... I only wish I' d learned this lesson sooner.
But it' s too late now.
Perhaps I should pray...... that I, too, will remember our love so little.
Because I will never know joy again...... till I forget...... or you remember.
King Gunther...... do you take Brunhild as your wife and qu ee n?
I do.
And do you, Brunhild...... accept my king as your rightful husband and lord?
I do.
Do you, Kriemhild...... take Siegfried as your lawful wedded husband?
I do.
King Siegfried...... do you take Kriemhild as your lawful wedded wife?
I do.
I now pronounce you...... man and wife.
This warlike display...... shows our Burgund swords and warriors at their finest.
They could only be bettered by the great Qu ee n Brunhild...... and the extraordinary King Gunther.
Those few of us who were privileged to travel with King Gunther to Iceland...... witnessed a display of incomparable skills.
And King Gunther was the only man who could match...... his beautiful qu ee n in her challenge.
Siegfried could.
But Siegfried didn' t.
Would he like to try?
It would be an honour...... Qu ee n Brunhild.
What weapons shall we choose then?
Weapons that were forged from the same ore...... and have never b ee n crossed.
My spear...... and your sword.
Thank you...... for this chance to recognize my limits.
- What happened?
- I was tired.
- I decided to lie down.
- That' s not what I meant.
- Why did you leave without me?
- Siegfried.
- In front of everyone.
- But you won.
He let me win.
I know a feigned defeat from an honest victory.
He was lucky, that' s all.
He probably gave up so he didn' t go to his marriage bed covered with bruises.
You' re the only woman I' ve ever really wanted.
And you have me.
Or do you?
You want me, my strong husband?
I' m waiting.
No more of this, my qu ee n.
I' ve drunk too much tonight to deal with such foolishness.
- What?
Or maybe you had b ee n drinking.
Some magical potion to give you strength, perhaps?
Well, I' il let you in on a little secret:
My strength...... is a gift from the gods.
And it lies in this belt.
Once you' ve removed it, you' il find a yielding maiden in your arms.
Can the man who survived my challenge not survive his own wedding night?
Brunhild, stop.
Untie me.
Stop this.
Untie me.
Untie me right now.
- Be quiet now.
- Wife, are you mad?
Let me loose!
- Gunther' s a lucky man.
- Not as lucky as I am.
Don' t you think Brunhild' s beautiful?
What a question for such a time and place.
- Siegfried, answer me.
- All right, yes, she' s beautiful.
- But it' s a hard beauty.
- You noticed it then.
- What?
- That coldness.
The angry way she looks at us.
Well, she' s certainly angry about being defeated by Gunther.
I don' t think she likes me much.
Well, maybe because you won your husband without having to fight him.
Hear that?
That' s Thor swinging his hammer.
Probably to tell us about the war god who' s going to be conceived tonight.
Giselher...... you don' t really believe in all this pagan nonsense, do you?
I do.
And so does Siegfried.
And he' s the greatest hero Burgund has ever known.
I believe in what he does:
Living life by the sword.
And I' m going to do the same.
And when I die...... I' il be rewarded by sitting at the warriors' table...... next to Father Odin himself.
You should hear yourself.
- No, they don' t.
They scare me.
The powers in it are uncontrollable, dangerous.
Anyway, it' s not the way we were brought up.
Lena...... I didn' t mean to hurt you.
Brunhild...... please don' t let the servants s ee me like this.
- I' il never try to subdue you again.
- Then let this be a lesson to you.
I might be captive in this gilded cage, but I will never be your wife.
Gunther.
Siegfried.
What' s the matter?
Can I speak openly and know you won' t tell anyone?
Of course.
The qu ee n...
We haven' t...
What?
Siegfried, she won' t let me into her bed.
- I' m sorry.
- And Burgund n ee ds an heir.
I must have a son.
If there was anything I could do, I would.
- But this isn' t a battle I can win for you.
- But that' s not true.
You' ve proven that your strength is greater than hers.
And her strength doesn' t even come from her own body.
It comes from a pagan belt that she wears.
- Lf you can get it away from her...
- No!
No, Gunther.
I' m only asking you to take her belt, not substitute for me in some other way.
You' d refuse to help the man who gave you his own sister?
Your magic Tarnhelm worked for us in Iceland, blood brother.
But if you don' t use it here, tonight...... then all of that' s b ee n wasted, and my marriage is a joke.
Shadows and vapours, all the same.
Good night, my king.
Lena.
- Don' t be long.
I have to tell you something.
Come in here.
I love you too.
He just passed this way.
Something very strange is happening here.
I just want us to be happy together...... to be man and wife.
Look at you, my king.
You are a match for me, are you not?
After all, you defeated me in Iceland.
Well, well...... my king regains his st ee l.
Strange how it comes and goes without warning.
Listen, I don' t wanna fight.
- I love you.
- Prove it.
That' s what I n ee ded to know.
Siegfried?
Now you can be my husband.
Where are you going?
To get rid of this pagan witchery.
And when I return...... I expect you to be my wife.
Do you swear to k ee p this secret?
In Iceland, I saw two Gunthers too.
When my brother returned after his victory over Queen Brunhild...... it wasn' t Gunther who arrived in the room.
It was Siegfried.
Gunther had been hiding in there all the time.
I know it wasn' t my brother who defeated Brunhild.
It was Siegfried.
Where have you b ee n?
Kriemhild.
Why aren' t you in bed?
I woke up and you weren' t there.
I couldn' t get back to sl ee p without you, so I waited.
What' s that in your hand?
Nothing important.
Let me s ee.
A woman' s belt?
Why try to hide it?
It' s not what you think.
We' ve only b ee n married one day.
All I can tell you is...... your brother n ee ded me.
What for?
That I cannot tell you.
Why not?
I promised not to.
I swear before all the gods that I remain your true and faithful husband.
So why won' t you answer my questions?
What help did my brother n ee d that took you from your bed at this hour?
And what kind of help leaves a woman' s belt in your hand?
If I told you, I would be breaking a vow of the utmost secrecy.
Break it.
- Open the doors for us, please.
- I cannot do that, my lady.
Why not?
What?
No one may enter the church until the Qu ee n of the Burgunds does so.
- You must be joking.
- We cannot, Lady Kriemhild.
How dare you order the doors of this place closed to me?
I am the king' s own sister.
And I am his wife...... Qu ee n of all Burgund.
It is only right that I should enter before other lesser royals.
- Step aside and let your qu ee n pass.
- You' re no qu ee n of mine, Brunhild.
And how dare you refer to my husband as lesser than anyone?
He even introduced himself in Iceland as Gunther' s servant.
He s erve d your husband well when he defeated you last night.
- What did you say?
- You heard me.
And it was also my husband who conquered you in Iceland.
You insult the Qu ee n of Burgund in public with these lies?
So first I' m a servant' s wife, and now I' m a liar?
Do you recognize this?
- Who gave you that?
- My husband.
Do you believe me now?
He took it from you last night, in your own bedroom.
It surprises me that you couldn' t tell.
Now get out of my way.
I don' t understand how you could reveal my most intimate secret...... and your brother' s, in front of the whole of Burgund.
Kriemhild, I only broke my vow because I counted on your discretion.
I' m sorry.
Please forgive me.
I love you more than life.
Now I' m terrified something awful will happen, and somehow we' il be parted.
No more tears.
In two days, we' il be far away from this place...... far away from your brother and his marriage.
He was wrong to make you a part of it.
He took advantage of your loyalty.
But it' s over now.
I' il attend the hunt with him, and we' il part as friends.
Today, I' il give orders for the gold to be loaded onto our ship.
As soon as the hunt is done...... we can be on our way.
- Can' t it be done any sooner?
I wish...... but we cannot give your brother the impression...... that we leave bearing him ill will.
- Never mind that.
What justice can I administer to put this right?
The simple justice laid down in our books of law may not be sufficient.
Siegfried has used magic to help you, it' s true.
But what other use has he made of it?
You' ve heard the people praise him more than you.
Now he has your sister' s hand in marriage.
He has a legitimate claim to the throne of Burgund.
- Your downfall?
- You said the presence of that hoard...... in my chamber would bring me good.
Even if the qu ee n begets a child by you, every tongue in Burgund will wag...... with the gossip that it' s really Siegfried' s bastard.
The kingdom is already rife with the scandal.
It won' t go away.
It will taint you and your house till the end of your days...... unless something is done.
I' il end the alliance and send him away.
- Let him live out his days in Xanten.
- It' s not enough.
You may not care if men scorn you as a weakling and a cuckold.
I was betrayed by the dragon slayer and by you.
I am the Qu ee n of Iceland and Burgund.
I will not be dishonored.
I will be avenged.
There is only one punishment fit for such a crime.
What would you have me do?
It' s very simple.
Siegfried must die.
You can' t mean it.
He' s my friend.
More than my friend...... my blood brother.
I can' t just have him killed.
Either you kill him...... or I kill myself.
My king...... perhaps his punishment could come about accidentally at the hunt.
You know Siegfried is invincible.
And you know as well as I that he is not.
- King Siegfried, shall we ride together?
- Brother - in- law.
- May I join you as well?
- I' d be honoured.
Come on!
Qu ee n Brunhild?
Qu ee n Brunhild, please let me talk to you.
This trouble betw ee n us has to be settled.
Please, Qu ee n Brunhild.
I have something that' s rightfully yours which I must return.
Ind ee d you have something that is rightfully mine.
But it is far too late for you to return it.
You Christians make much of forgiveness.
- Don' t look for such in me.
- I don' t, Qu ee n Brunhild.
All I can do is say how bitter my sorrow is...... for the way I treated you in front of the cathedral.
I was jealous.
And when I thought of what s ee med to be happening, I couldn' t bear it.
Once I loved a man who I thought the gods themselves had sent me.
I loved the whole world because he was in it.
Long we were parted...... but I could bear it...... because I knew he would return one day.
But when he came again...... it was as if his heart had b ee n wiped clean.
I loved him as I had...... but he did not love me.
We were strangers...... as before we had b ee n...... Iovers.
Siegfried?
Siegfried.
Brunhild, I have done you a terrible wrong.
- I am not.
I speak of something far worse.
What are you talking about?
You have done me no other great harm.
Once I loved a man who did not love me.
And I could not bear it, for the world was an empty place without him.
So when Hagen came to me with an unholy thing...... that would banish the memory of old loves and plant a new one there...... I blinded myself to what was right and gave it to that man to drink.
It was Hagen' s magic.
Siegfried never knew.
And even if he did, there would be nothing he could do against it.
That is my great sin against you...... and him.
And I will do penance for it for the rest of my life.
So I' m not the only one who got lucky.
Well done, brother.
- Have a drink with us.
- I' il wash the blood off first.
Brunhild.
Is Siegfried not back?
We should leave before dark.
I' il go and get him.
Siegfried?
Siegfried?
Siegfried!
No.
Help.
Help!
Help!
Somebody help!
Arminius!
There was an ambush.
A group of Saxons.
Murderer.
How can you accuse me?
What reason do I have to kill a man who' s done us so much good?
Envy and guilt...... and gr ee d.
And with him dead, you could k ee p the hoard for yourself.
All of it.
The hoard.
I don' t want it anymore.
You wanted the gold for yourself.
That' s why you slew him.
- We planned it together!
- You' il never have the gold!
But the gold is my Nibelung birthright!
It' s mine!
You insolent son of a dwarf!
K ee p out of this, boy.
He murdered our king!
I order you to arrest him!
Those of you who ally with me...... will be rewarded with gold from the hoard.
And finally betrayed, as he betrayed me.
Hagen of Tronje...... face the fate my gods have chosen.
Your gods are dead!
Soon we will know.
Return this ring to its rightful owner.
Take it back to the Nibelungs.
Arminius.
Today the old gods live again.
No, Giselher.
Today the old gods will die with them.
By 300 AD, the Roman Empire extended from Arabia to Britain.
But they wanted more.
More peoples loyal and subservient to Rome.
But no people so important as the powerful Sarmatians to the east.
Thousands died on that field.
And when the smoke cleared on the fourth day, the only Sarmatian soldiers left alive were members of the decimated but legendary cavalry.
The Romans, impressed by their bravery and horsemanship, spared their lives.
In exchange, these warriors were incorporated into the Roman military.
Better they had died that day.
Father.
They are here.
For the second part of the bargain they struck indebted not only themselves...
The day has come... but also their sons, and their sons, and so on, to serve the empire as knights.
I was such a son.
There is a legend that fallen knights return as great horses.
He has seen what awaits you, and he will protect you.
Lancelot!
Lancelot.
I will return.
- How long shall we be gone?
- 1 5 years, not including the months it' il take to get to your post.
Lancelot!
(Lancelot) Our post was Britain - or at least the southern half, for the land was divided by a 73- mile wall built three centuries before us to protect the empire from the native fighters of the north.
So, as our forefathers had done, we made our way and reported to our Roman commander in Britain, ancestrally named for the first Artorius, or Arthur.
1 5 YEARS LATER
Ah, as promised, the bishop' s carriage.
- Our freedom, Bors.
I can almost taste it.
And your passage to Rome, Arthur.
Woads!
(uproar, swords clinking)
Save your prayers, boy.
Your god doesn' t live here.
Why did Merlin send you south of the wall?
Spill my blood with Excalibur and... make this ground holy.
Pick it up.
Pick it up.
- Bors.
- What a bloody mess.
That' s not the bishop.
God help us.
- What are they?
- Blue demons that eat Christians alive.
You' re not a Christian, are you?
Does this really work?
Nothing.
Maybe I' m not doin 'it right.
(man chuckling) Arthur!
Arthur Castus.
Your father' s image.
I haven' t seen you since childhood.
Bishop Germanius.
Welcome to Britain.
I see your military skills are still of use to you.
Your device worked.
Ancient tricks of an ancient dog.
And these are the great Sarmatian knights we have heard so much of in Rome.
I thought the Woads control the north of Hadrian' s Wall.
They do, but they occasionally venture south.
Rome' s anticipated withdrawal from Britain has only increased their daring.
- (man) Woads?
- British rebels who hate Rome.
Men who want their country back.
- Who leads them?
- He' s called Merlin.
A dark magician, some say.
Tristan, ride ahead and make sure the road is clear.
Please do not worry, Bishop.
We will protect you.
I' ve no doubt, Commander.
No doubt.
Dozens don' t worry me nearly so much as thousands.
Thousands?
Well, now that we' re free men, I' m gonna drink till I can' t piss straight.
- You do that every night.
- I never could piss straight.
Too much of myself to handle... down there.
Well, it' s a problem.
It' s a problem.
- It' s like a baby' s arm holding an apple.
I don' t like him, that Roman.
If he' s here to discharge us, why doesn' t he just give us our papers?
- Is this your happy face?
Galahad, do you still not know the Romans?
They won' t scratch their asses without holding a ceremony.
Why don' t you just kill him, and then discharge yourself after?
I don' t kill for pleasure, unlike some.
Well, you should try it someday.
It' s in your blood.
- No, no, no.
As of tomorrow this was all just a bad memory.
I' ve often thought about what going home would mean after all this.
It' s different for Galahad.
I' ve been in this life longer than the other.
It' s not so clear in my memory.
You speak for yourself.
It' s cold back there and everyone I know is dead and buried.
Besides, I have, I think, a dozen children.
Eleven.
When the Romans leave here, we' il have the run of all this place.
I' il be governor in my own village and Dagonet will be my personal guard and royal ass- kisser.
Won' t you, Dag?
First thing I will do when I get home is find a beautiful Sarmatian woman to wed.
A beautiful Sarmatian woman?
Why do you think we left in the first place?
What are your plans for home?
I expect to be spending a lot of time at Gawain' s house.
- I see.
And what will I be doing?
Wondering at your good fortune that all your children look like me.
Is that before or after I hit you with my ax?
Where you been, now?
And what will you do, Arthur, when you return to your beloved Rome?
Give thanks to God that I survived to see it.
You disturb me.
I want peace, Lancelot.
- Ah!
It' s a magnificent place, Rome.
Ordered, civilized, advanced.
A breeding ground of arrogant fools.
The greatest minds in all the lands have come together in one sacred place to help make mankind free.
And the women?
(guard) Open the gate!
- Welcome back, Arthur.
- Jols.
Bishop, please, my quarters have been made available to you.
I must rest.
- Where have you been?
- I' ve been waiting for you.
- Oh, my little flower.
Where' s my Gilly?
- You been fighting?
- Yes.
- You been winning?
- Yes.
That' s my boy.
(all cheer)
Pelagius.
Very kind of Arthur to give up his room.
But, of course, it is to be expected.
Sir, I' m here to escort you to the fortress hall.
When my master meets with your knights, he must be seated last and he must be seated at the head of the table.
Your master can plonk his holy ass wherever he chooses.
His Eminence, Bishop Naius Germanius.
A round table?
What sort of evil is this?
Arthur says for men to be men they must first all be equal.
I was given to understand there would be more of you.
There were.
We have been fighting here for 1 5 years, Bishop.
Oh, of course.
Arthur and his knights have served with courage to maintain the honor of Rome' s empire on this last outpost of our glory.
Rome is most indebted to you noble knights.
To your final days as servants to the empire.
Not days.
The Pope' s taken a personal interest in you.
He inquires after each of you, and is curious to know if your knights have converted to the word of Our Savior or...?
I have never questioned that.
They are pagans.
For our part, the Church has deemed such beliefs innocence, but you, Arthur, your path to God is through Pelagius?
- I saw his image in your room.
- He took my father' s place for me.
His teachings on free will and equality have been a great influence.
Ah.
Rome awaits your arrival with great anticipation.
You are a hero.
In Rome, you will live out your days in honor and wealth.
Alas, we are all but players in an ever- changing world.
Barbarians from every corner are almost at Rome' s door.
Because of this, Rome and the Holy Father have decided to remove ourselves from indefensible outposts, such as Britain.
What will become of Britain is not our concern anymore.
- Saxons?
- Yes.
In the north a massive Saxon incursion has begun.
- And only kill everything.
So you would just leave the land to the Woads.
Hm.
Gentlemen, your discharge papers with safe conduct throughout the Roman Empire.
But first, I must have a word with your commander.
- We have no secrets.
Let' s leave Roman business to Romans.
Let it go, Bors.
Rome has issued a final order for you and your men.
Final order?
You are to travel north to rescue the family of Marius Honorius and return, in particular, with Marius' s son, Alecto.
Alecto is the Pope' s favorite godchild and pupil.
It is his destiny to become a bishop, perhaps even pope one day.
On this day you ask this of my men.
On this day.
They have risked their lives for 1 5 years for a cause not of their own.
And now, on the day they are to be liberated, you send them on a mission which is far more dangerous than any other they have undertaken.
You tell me, Bishop, how do I go to my men and tell them that instead of freedom I offer death?
If your men are truly the knights of legend, perhaps some will survive.
If it is God' s will.
Your men want to go home, and to get home they need to cross the entire breadth of the Roman Empire.
Deserters would be hunted down like dogs.
Rome?
God himself?
Everything I' ve done has been for the Church and for Rome.
Do not mistake a loyal soldier for a fool, Germanius.
Would you leave a defenseless Roman boy, destined to lead our Church, at the hands of the Saxons?
Fulfill this mission, and your men will receive their discharge.
Their papers will be waiting here the moment they return.
You have my word.
You think very hard upon that vow, Bishop, for I will hold you to it.
Break it, and no Roman legion, papal army, nor God himself will protect you.
That is my word.
Best of three.
Who wants another drink?
When you gonna leave Bors and come home with me?
My lover is watching you.
You look nothing like him.
You' re all Bors.
- How do you do that?
I aim for the middle.
- Here.
- Oh, come here.
Dagonet, where you been?
We' ve got plans to make.
- No.
- Just a last one.
- No, I' m trying to work.
- Come sing.
Shut up!
Vanora will sing.
- (man) Sing about home.
- (Gawain) Don' t drop the baby.
Arthur!
Arthur!
Arthur!
You' re not completely Roman yet, right?
Knights... brothers in arms... your courage has been tested beyond all limits.
But I must ask you now for one further trial.
Drink.
We must leave on a final mission for Rome before our freedom can be granted.
Above the wall, far in the north, there is a Roman family in need of rescue.
They are trapped by Saxons.
Our orders are to secure their safety.
Let the Romans take care of their own.
Above the wall is Woad territory.
Our duty to Rome, if it was ever a duty, is done.
Our pact with Rome is done.
Every knight here has laid his life on the line for you.
For you.
And instead of freedom you want more blood?
Our blood?
Bors!
These are our orders.
We leave at first light, and when we return your freedom will be waiting for you.
A freedom we can embrace with honor.
I am a free man!
Yeah, yeah.
We' re all going to die someday.
If it' s a death from a Saxon hand that frightens you, stay home.
Enough!
- I' ve got something to live for!
The Romans have broken their word.
We have the word of Arthur.
That is good enough.
I' il prepare.
Bors?
- You coming?
- Of course I' m coming!
Can' t let you go on your own!
You' il all get killed!
I' m just saying what you' re all thinking!
Vanora' il kill me.
And you, Gawain?
I' m with you.
Galahad as well.
O merciful God, I have such need of your mercy now.
Not for myself, but for my knights, for this is truly their hour of need.
Deliver them from the trials ahead, and I will repay you a thousandfold with any sacrifice you ask of me.
I will gladly make that covenant.
I ask no more than that.
Why do you always talk to God and not to me?
Oh, pray to whomever you pray that we don' t cross the Saxons.
My faith is what protects me, Lancelot.
Why do you challenge this?
I don' t like anything that puts a man on his knees.
No man fears to kneel before the god he trusts.
Without faith, without belief in something, what are we?
- Them we' ve fought before.
- Not north of the wall!
How many Saxons?
How many?!
These people need our help.
- It is our duty to bring them out.
- I don' t care about your charge, and I don' t give a damn about Romans, Britain or this island.
If you desire to spend eternity in this place, Arthur, so be it, but suicide cannot be chosen for another!
- And yet you choose death for this family!
- No, I choose life!
And freedom for myself and the men!
How many times in battle have we snatched victory from the jaws of defeat?
Outnumbered, outflanked, yet still we triumph.
With you at my side, we can do so again.
Lancelot, we are knights.
What other purpose do we serve if not for such a cause?
Arthur, you fight for a world that will never exist.
Never.
There will always be a battlefield.
I will die in battle.
Of that I' m certain.
And hopefully a battle of my choosing.
But if it be this one, grant me a favor.
Don' t bury me in our sad little cemetery.
Burn me.
Burn me and cast my ashes to a strong east wind.
Don' t touch their women.
We don' t mix with these people.
What kind of offspring do you think that would yield?
Half people.
I will not have our Saxon blood watered down by mixing with them.
According to our laws, no man may deny me the spoils of our conquest!
He speaks the truth, Father.
O, my lord!
God' s thanks, my lord.
Thank you.
Kill her.
No!
(softly) Are you challenging me?
If you want to challenge me, you have to have a sword in your hand.
As long as my heart beats, I rule and you hold your tongue.
Or I' il cut it out.
We are three days' march from the Great Wall, if we camp at night.
We won' t camp.
The wall - what troops are stationed there?
Light Roman infantry and possibly Sarmatian knights.
Arthur?
Who is this Arthur?
It is said he has never been defeated in battle.
It is said he is a great warrior.
Why should I trust you?
You' re a traitor to your own people.
Tell my father of the Roman estate.
Speak up!
A very high- ranking family live there.
They are of great importance to Rome.
Father, their ransom could pay for the entire campaign.
I' il attack from the north with the main army.
You bring your men down here.
Cut off their retreat to the south.
Burn every village, kill everybody.
Never leave behind you a man, woman or child who can ever carry a sword.
Saxon.
How many?
Thousands.
(Tristan) Woads.
They' re tracking us.
(Arthur) Where?
Everywhere.
Get back!
This way!
What are you waiting for?
Devil ghosts.
- Why would they not attack?
- Merlin doesn' t want us dead.
We should have killed them, Merlin.
There might be a purpose for Artorius and his Knights.
No!
He is our enemy!
So is the Saxon!
Oh, I can' t wait to leave this island.
If it' s not raining, it' s snowing.
If it' s not snowing, it' s foggy.
The rain is good.
Washes all the blood away.
Doesn' t help the smell.
Hey, Bors, do you intend to take Vanora and all your little bastards back home?
Oh, I' m trying to avoid that decision... by getting killed.
Dagonet, she wants to get married and give the children names.
Women!
The children already have names, don' t they?
Just Gilly.
It was too much trouble, so we gave the rest of them numbers.
That' s interesting.
And I thought you couldn' t count.
You know, I never thought I' d get back home alive.
I don' t want to leave my children.
- You' d miss' em too much.
- I' il take them with me.
I like the little bastards.
They mean something to me.
Especially number three.
- He' s a good fighter.
- That' s because he' s mine.
I' m going for a piss.
- (guard) Who are you?
Commander of the Sarmatian Knights, sent by Bishop Germanius of Rome.
Open the gate.
(man) It is a wonder you have come.
Good Jesus.
Arthur and his knights.
You have fought the Woads.
Vile creatures.
Our orders are to evacuate you immediately.
But that... that is impossible.
- Which is Alecto?
- I am Alecto.
Alecto is my son.
And everything we have is here in the land given to us by the Pope of Rome.
- Well, you' re about to give it to the Saxons.
- They' re invading from the north.
- Then Rome will send an army.
Us.
- We leave as soon as you' re packed.
- I refuse to leave.
Go back to work!
- Get back to work, all of you!
If I fail to bring you and your son back, my men can never leave this land.
So you' re coming with me if I have to tie you to my horse and drag you all the way to Hadrian' s Wall myself.
My lord.
Lady, my knights are hungry.
Go.
Come!
Let us go, hm?
(man) Sir, you' re famous.
You' re Arthur, aren' t you?
I' d serve you proudly.
Are you from Rome?
From hell.
- Sir.
- Who is this man?
He' s our village elder.
What is this punishment for?
- Answer me!
- He defied our master, Marius.
Most of the food we grow is sent out by sea to be sold.
He asked that we keep a little more for ourselves, that' s all.
My ass has been snappin 'at the grass I' m so hungry!
You' re from Rome.
Is it true that Marius is a spokesman for God and that it' s a sin to defy him?
I tell you now.
Marius is not of God.
And you, all of you, were free from your first breath!
Help this man.
Help him!
Now hear me.
A vast and terrible army is coming this way.
They will show no mercy, spare no one.
Those of you who are able should gather your things and begin to move south towards Hadrian' s Wall.
Those unable shall come with us.
Get these people ready.
(Ganis) Right, you heard him.
You go grab enough food and water for the journey.
Let' s get a hurry on, else we' re all dead!
Come on, hurry.
They have flanked us to the east.
They' re coming from the south, trying to cut off our escape.
They' il be here before nightfall.
- How many?
- An entire army.
East.
There is a trail heading east across the mountains.
It means we have to cross behind Saxon lines, but that' s the one we should take.
They' re coming with us.
Then we' il never make it.
- Back to work!
Move.
Move.
- What is this?
- You cannot go in there.
No one goes in there.
This place is forbidden.
(Marius) What are you doing?
Arthur, we have no time.
Do you not hear the drums?
Dagonet.
- Key.
- It is locked.
From the inside.
- (whimpers)
Move!
- Gawain.
Who are these defilers of the Lord' s temple?
Out of the way.
The work of your god.
Is this how he answers your prayers?
See if there' s any still alive.
How dare you set foot in this holy place?
- There was a man of God.
- Not my god!
- (Arthur) This one' s dead.
- By this smell, they are all dead.
You even move, you join him.
Arthur!
You must not fear me.
Give me some water!
His arm is broken.
And his family?
She' s a Woad.
I' m a Roman officer.
You' re safe now.
- You' re safe.
- Stop what you are doing!
What is this madness?
- They' re all pagans here!
They refuse to do the task God has set for them!
They must die as an example!
You mean they refused to be your serfs!
You are a Roman.
You understand.
And you are a Christian.
You!
You kept her alive!
- (soldier) My lord!
No, stop!
When we get to the wall you will be punished for this heresy.
Perhaps I should kill you now and seal my fate.
I was willing to die with them.
Yes, to lead them to their rightful place.
It is God' s wish that these sinners be sacrificed.
Only then can their souls be saved.
Then I shall grant his wish.
- Wall them back up.
- Arthur.
I said wall them up!
Don' t you see it is the will of God that these sinners be sacrificed?
We' re moving too slow.
The girl' s not gonna make it, and neither is the boy.
The family we can protect, but we' re wasting our time with all these people.
We' re not leaving them.
If the Saxons find us, we will have to fight.
Then save your anger for them.
Is this Rome' s quest or Arthur' s?
- How is he?
He burns.
Brave boy.
Some of your fingers are out of place.
I have to push them back.
If I don' t do this, there' s a chance you may never use them again.
They tortured me.
With machines.
To make me tell them things that... that I didn' t know to begin with.
And then...
I heard your voice in the dark.
I am Guinevere.
You are Arthur... of the Knights from the Great Wall.
I am.
The famous Briton who kills his own people.
I found tracks coming from the south, but none going back.
Horsemen traveling light and fast.
Could be Roman cavalry.
Could be knights.
They know we' re after them.
They' il head east now, through the mountains.
I am a servant of God!
He says they walled him up in a building and took the family.
Someone who goes by the name of Artorius.
It' s him.
It' s Arthur.
Hunt them down.
I' il take the main army to the wall.
Bring the family there.
- (man) And the monks?
- Put them back where you found them.
I am a servant of God!
I am a servant of God!
Burn it all.
My father told me great tales of you.
Really?
And what did you hear?
Fairy tales.
The kind you hear about people so brave, so selfless, that they can' t be real.
Arthur and his knights.
A leader both Briton and Roman.
And yet you chose your allegiance to Rome.
To those who take what does not belong to them.
That same Rome that took your men from their homeland.
Listen, lady, do not pretend you know anything about me or my men.
How many Britons have you killed?
As many as tried to kill me.
It' s the natural state of any man to want to live.
Animals live!
It' s a natural state of any man to want to live free in their own country.
I belong to this land.
Where do you belong, Arthur?
How' s your hand?
I' il live, I promise you.
Is there nothing about my land that appeals to your heart?
Your own father married a Briton.
Even he must have found something to his liking.
We' il sleep here.
Take shelter in those trees.
- Tristan.
- You wanna go out again?
You betrayed me.
He means you no harm.
Peace between us this night, Arthur Castus.
The Saxon is come.
The world we have known and fought for is ended.
Now we must make a new world.
Your world, Merlin, not mine.
I shall be in Rome.
To find peace?
The Saxon will come to Rome.
My knights trust me not to betray them to their enemy.
Rome was my enemy, not Arthur.
We have no fight between us now.
You tell that to the knights you killed before my eyes, whose bones are buried in this earth.
We have all lost brothers.
You know nothing of the loss I speak!
Shall I help you remember?
An attack on a village.
The screams of an innocent woman.
Mother!
Artorius!
Mother!
Mother!
I ran to the burial mound of my father to free her.
T o kill you.
Father, please let loose your sword.
I feel the heat of that fire on my face even now.
I did not wish her dead.
She was of our blood, as are you.
If you were so determined to leave us to slaughter, why did you save so many?
My men are strong, but they have need of a true leader.
They believe you can do anything.
To defeat the Saxon we need a master of war.
Why do you think I spared you in the forest?
That sword you carry is made of iron from this earth, forged in the fires of Britain.
It was love of your mother that freed the sword, not hatred of me.
Love, Arthur.
Seize him!
No!
I have the boy!
- Kill him!
Let him go!
Kill him now!
Hah!
(Lancelot) Your hands seem to be better.
Artorius!
Do we have a problem?
You have a choice.
You help or you die.
Put down your weapons.
See the crows?
They never tasted prince before.
Is this what you left me for?!
Fight!
Fight me!
You coward!
Fight me!
We have a pact!
Fight!
Fight him, son.
Fight him.
- The Trojans have violated the agreement!
Prepare for battle!
This is not honor!
This is not worthy of royalty!
If he doesn' t fight, Troy is doomed.
The fight is over.
The fight is not over.
Stand back, Prince Hector.
I don' t care.
He is my brother.
Paris!
Go!
Get inside, Paris!
Archers!
- Our men are too close to the walls.
- Pull back, you fool!
For Troy!
- Now!
Get them in line!
Get the men back into lines!
Front line, push!
Forward.
Forward!
Apollonians!
Prince Hector!
We need to retreat!
My army' s never lost a battle yet!
You won' t have an army if you don' t fall back!
Back to the ships!
- Back!
- Halt!
Halt!
But we have them on the run!
We' re in range of their archers.
Have our men gather our fallen.
They can collect their dead.
Would they have done the same for us?
Go!
Back!
Fall back into line!
You think I' m a coward.
I am a coward.
I knew he would kill me.
You were watching.
My father.
My brother.
All of Troy.
Shame didn' t matter.
I gave up my pride...... my honor...... just to live.
For love.
You challenged a great warrior.
That took courage.
I betrayed you.
Menelaus was a brave man.
He lived for fighting.
And every day I was with him, I wanted to walk into the sea and drown.
I don' t want a hero, my love.
I want a man I can grow old with.
They' re laughing at me in Troy.
Drunk with victory!
They think I' il sail home at first light.
Maybe we should.
Flee?
Like a whipped dog?
The men believe we came here for Menelaus' wife.
Won' t be needing her anymore.
My brother' s blood still wets the sand, and you insult him!
It' s no insult to say a dead man is dead.
If we leave now, we lose all credibility.
How long before the Hittites invade?
If we stay, we stay here for the right reasons.
To protect Greece, not your pride.
Your private battle with Achilles is destroying us.
Achilles is one man.
Hector is one man.
Look what he did to us today.
Hector fights for his country!
Achilles fights only for himself!
I care about his ability to win battles.
He' s right.
The men' s morale is weak.
Even if I could make peace with Achilles, the man won' t listen to me!
He' s as likely to spear me as to speak to me!
I' il talk to him.
He' il want the girl back.
He can have that damn girl.
I haven' t touched her.
Where is she?
I gave her to the men.
They need some amusement after today.
Come on, give the bitch to me!
Who' s first?
Trojan whore!
A virgin' s robe?
- You won' t be needing that much longer!
Are you hurt?
I watched you fight them.
You have courage.
To fight back when people attack me?
Dog has that kind of courage.
Eat.
I' ve known men like you my whole life.
No, you haven' t.
You think you' re so different from 1000 others?
Soldiers understand nothing but war.
Peace confuses them.
- And you hate these soldiers.
- I pity them.
Trojan soldiers died trying to protect you.
Perhaps they deserve more than your pity.
Why did you choose this life?
- What life?
- To be a great warrior.
I chose nothing.
I was born, and this is what I am.
And you?
Why did you choose to love a god?
I think you' il find the romance one- sided.
Do you enjoy provoking me?
You' ve dedicated your life to the gods.
You serve them.
- Yes, of course.
Who blankets his bed with the skin of men he' s killed?
All the gods are to be feared and respected.
I' il tell you a secret...... something they don' t teach you in your temple.
The gods envy us.
They envy us because we' re mortal.
Because any moment might be our last.
Everything' s more beautiful because we' re doomed.
You will never be lovelier than you are now.
We will never be here again.
I thought you were a dumb brute.
I could have forgiven a dumb brute.
Do it.
Nothing is easier.
Aren' t you afraid?
Everyone dies.
What does it matter?
Do it.
You' il kill more men if I don' t kill you.
Many.
My lord, there' s...
Tell the men to start loading the ship.
We' re going home.
Agamemnon is a proud man.
But he knows when he' s made a mistake.
The man sends you to make his apologies?
What are you doing enthralled to that pig of a king?
The world seems simple to you, my friend...... but when you' re a king, very few choices are simple.
Ithaca cannot afford an enemy like Agamemnon.
Are we supposed to fear him?
You don' t fear anyone.
That' s your problem.
Fear is useful.
We need you back.
Greece needs you.
Greece will be Greece long after I' m dead.
I' m not talking about the land.
The men need you.
Stay, Achilles.
You were born for this war.
Things are less simple today.
Women have a way of complicating things.
Of all the kings of Greece, I respect you the most.
But in this war, you' re a servant.
Sometimes you have to serve in order to lead.
I hope you understand that one day.
We' re going home?
We sail in the morning.
Greeks are being slaughtered.
We can' t just sail away.
If it' s fighting you still long for, there will always be another war.
You betray all of Greece just to see Agamemnon fall.
Someone has to lose.
The gods favor our cause.
Now is the time to destroy the Greek army.
Their morale is battered.
Hit them now.
Hit them hard.
And they will run.
The Myrmidons didn' t fight yesterday.
There must be dissension among the Greeks.
But if we attack their ships, we will unify them.
If they decide to attack us, let them.
We' il beat them back again.
Yesterday, the Greeks underestimated us.
We should not return the favor.
You' re confident about the meaning of these omens?
The desecration of his temple angers Apollo.
The gods have cursed the Greeks.
Prepare the army.
We attack at daybreak.
Am I still your captive?
You' re my guest.
In Troy, guests can leave whenever they want.
You should leave then.
Would you leave this all behind?
Would you leave Troy?
Hold those barricades!
Archers to the rear.
Achilles.
Now!
Enough for one day.
Back to the ships!
It was his cousin.
To Troy!
- Back to the city!
We were going to sail home today.
I don' t think anyone' s sailing home now.
Achilles.
You violated my command.
No, my lord.
There was a mistake.
I ordered the Myrmidons to stand down.
You led them into combat.
I didn' t lead them, my lord.
We thought you did.
Where' s Patroclus?
Patroclus!
We thought he was you, my lord.
He wore your armor, your shield, your greaves, your helmet.
He even moved like you.
Where is he?
- Where?
- He' s dead, my lord.
Hector cut his throat.
Where are you taking me?
Do you remember how to get here?
The next time you come here, follow the tunnel.
There are no turns, so you can' t get lost.
Just keep walking.
When you get to the end, you' il be by the river.
Follow the river until you get to Mount Ida.
Why are you telling me this?
- Lf I die...
- No.... I don' t know how long the city will stand.
If the Greeks get inside the walls, it' s over.
They' il kill all the men, throw the babies from the city walls.
- The women, they' il take as slaves.
- That, for you, will be worse than dying.
- Why are you saying such things?
Because I want you to be ready.
I want you to get our boy, and I want you to bring him here.
You save as many people as you can, but you get here.
And you run.
And he was young.
He was much too young.
That boy has just saved this war for us.
- Eudorus.
- My lord.
I need my armor.
No.
Don' t go!
Rope!
Hector' s my cousin.
He' s a good man.
Don' t fight him.
Please.
No.
Hector!
Father...... forgive me for any offenses.
Hector!
May the gods be with you.
Hector.
No father ever had a better son.
Apollo guard you, my prince.
You' re the best man I know.
You' re a prince of Troy.
I know you' il make me proud.
Remember what I told you.
You don' t have to go.
You don' t.
You remember what I told you.
I' ve seen this moment in my dreams.
I' il make a pact with you.
With the gods as our witnesses...... let us pledge that the winner will allow the loser all the proper funeral rituals.
There are no pacts between lions and men.
Now you know who you' re fighting.
I thought it was you I was fighting yesterday.
And I wish it had been you.
But I gave the dead boy the honor he deserved.
You gave him the honor of your sword.
You won' t have ears or a tongue.
You' il wander the underworld, blind, deaf, and dumb, and all the dead will know:
This is Hector, the fool who thought he killed Achilles.
Get up, prince of Troy.
Get up.
I won' t let a stone take my glory.
You lost your cousin.
Now you' ve taken mine.
When does it end?
It never ends.
Who are you?
I have endured what no one on earth has endured before.
I kissed the hands of the man who killed my son.
Priam?
How did you get in here?
I know my own country better than the Greeks, I think.
You' re a brave man.
I could have your head on a spit in the blink of an eye.
Do you really think death frightens me now?
I watched my eldest son die...... watched you drag his body behind your chariot.
Give him back to me.
You know that.
Give him to me.
He killed my cousin.
He thought it was you.
How many cousins have you killed?
How many sons and fathers and brothers and husbands?
How many, brave Achilles?
I knew your father.
He died before his time.
But he was lucky not to live long enough to see his son fall.
You have taken everything from me.
My eldest son...... heir to my throne...... defender of my kingdom.
I cannot change what happened.
It is the will of the gods.
But give me this small mercy.
I loved my boy from the moment he opened his eyes...... till the moment you closed them.
Let me wash his body.
Let me say the prayers.
Let me place two coins on his eyes for the boatman.
If I let you walk out of here...... if I let you take him...... it doesn' t change anything.
You' re still my enemy in the morning.
You' re still my enemy tonight.
But even enemies can show respect.
I admire your courage.
Meet me outside in a moment.
We' il meet again soon, my brother.
Your son was the best I' ve fought.
In my country, the funeral games last for 12 days.
It is the same in my country.
Then the prince will have that honor.
No Greek will attack Troy for 12 days.
Briseis?
I thought you were dead.
You are free.
If I hurt you...... it' s not what I wanted.
Go.
No one will stop you.
You have my word.
Come, my girl.
You' re a far better king than the one leading this army.
Achilles makes a secret pact, and I have to honor it?
What treason is this?
Giving him 12 days of peace.
Peace!
Their army is leaderless.
This is the time to attack!
Even with Hector gone, we have no way to breach their walls.
I will smash their walls to the ground...... if it costs me 40, 000 Greeks.
Hear me, Zeus!
I will smash their walls to the ground.
That' s good.
For my son back home.
Well, Odysseus.
You found a way to make the sheep invite the wolves to dinner.
Forgive me, Eudorus.
I should never have struck you.
You' ve been a loyal friend all your life.
I hope I never disappoint you again.
It' s I who have been the disappointment.
Rouse the men.
You' re taking them home.
Aren' t you coming with us?
I have my own battle to fight.
No.
I don' t want our men to be a part of this.
It' s a beautiful night.
Go, Eudorus.
This is the last order I give you.
Fighting for you has been my life' s honor, my lord.
Open the gates!
Plague.
Don' t go too close, my king.
This is the will of the gods.
They desecrated the temple of Apollo...... and Apollo desecrated their flesh.
They thought they could come here and sack our city in a day.
Now look at them, fleeing across the Aegean.
What is this?
An offering to Poseidon.
The Greeks are praying for a safe return home.
This is a gift.
We should take it to the temple of Poseidon.
- I think we should burn it.
My prince, it' s a gift to the gods.
Father, burn it.
Look at them.
You' d think their prince had never died.
You are the prince now.
Make your brother proud.
Where is she?
- Where?
- I don' t know.
Please.
I have a son.
Then get him out of Troy.
Briseis!
Paris!
Andromache!
Helen.
We must go.
- I' il show you.
Hurry.
Paris.
It' s a long way.
We must go now.
Briseis!
Let it burn!
Let Troy burn!
Burn it!
Burn it all!
Burn Troy!
It' s a long way.
Quick.
- Come.
- No.
- My father will never abandon the city.
I can' t leave him.
The city is dead.
They' re burning it to the ground.
- What' s your name?
- Aeneas.
- Do you know how to use a sword?
- Yes.
The sword of Troy.
As long as it' s in the hands of a Trojan, our people have a future.
Protect them, Aeneas.
Find them a new home.
- Hurry.
I' il find her.
- I' il stay with you.
- Go.
How could you love me if I ran now?
We will be together.
Go.
Soldiers of Troy...... you men are warriors!
To lead you has been my honor!
My prince!
The boatman waits for us.
I say we make him wait a little longer!
Have you no honor?
Have you no honor?
Too late for prayer, priestess.
I almost lost this war because of your little romance.
You' il be my slave in Mycenae.
A Trojan priestess scrubbing my floors.
And at night...
Come with me.
Paris!
Don' t!
It' s all right.
You gave me peace...... in a lifetime of war.
Briseis, come.
Go.
No.
Go.
We must go.
I know a way out.
It' s all right.
Go.
Briseis, come.
Find peace...... my brother.
If they ever tell my story, let them say......
I walked with giants.
Men rise and fall like the winter wheat...... but these names will never die.
Let them say I lived in the time of Hector...... tamer of horses.
Let them say......
I lived in the time of Achilles.

Master Windu, may I interrupt?
General Kenobi has made contact with General Grievous, and we have begun our attack.
Thank you, Commander
Anakin, deliver this report to the Chancellor.
His reaction will give us a clue to his intentions.
Yes, Master.
I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi.
The dark side of the Force surrounds the Chancellor.
If he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of Grievous, then he should be removed from office.
the Jedi Council would have to take control of the Senate in order to secure a peaceful transition...
To a dark place this line of thought will carry us.
Hmmmmm... great care we must take.
Chancellor, we have just received a report from Master Kenobi.
He has engaged General Grievous.
We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge.
I should be there with him.
It is upsetting to me to see that the Council doesn' t seem to fully appreciate your talents.
Don' t you wonder why they won' t make you a Jedi Master?
I wish I knew.
More and more I get the feeling that I am being excluded from the Council.
I know there are things about the Force that they are not telling me.
They don' t trust you, Anakin.
They see your future.
They know your power will be too strong to control.
You must break through the fog of lies the Jedi have created around you.
Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force.
How do you know the ways of the Force?
My mentor taught me everything about the Force... even the nature of the dark side.
You know the dark side?!
Anakin, if one is to understand the great mystery, one must study all its aspects, not just the dogmatic, narrow view of the Jedi.
If you wish to become a complete and wise leader, you must embrace a larger view of the Force.
Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin.
Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi.
Learn to know the dark side of the Force,
Anakin, and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.
What did you say?
Use my knowledge, I beg you...
You' re a Sith Lord!
I know what has been troubling you...
Listen to me.
Don' t continue to be a pawn of the Jedi Council!
Ever since I' ve known you, you' ve been searching for a life greater than that of an ordinary Jedi... a life of significance, of conscience.
Are you going to kill me?
I would certainly like to.
I know you would.
I can feel your anger.
It gives you focus, makes you stronger.
I am going to turn you over to the Jedi Council.
Of course you should.
But you' re not sure of their intentions, are you?
I will quickly discover the truth of all this.
You have great wisdom, Anakin.
Know the power of the dark side.
The power to save Padme.
So uncivilized...
I must talk to you.
We have just received word that Obi- Wan has destroyed General Grievous.
We are on our way to make sure the Chancellor returns emergency powers back to the Senate.
He won' t give up his power.
I' ve just learned a terrible truth.
I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith Lord.
A Sith Lord?
Yes.
The one we have been looking for.
How do you know this?
He knows the ways of the Force.
He has been trained to use the dark side.
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
Then our worst fears have been realized.
We must move quickly if the Jedi Order is to survive.
Master, the Chancellor is very powerful.
You will need my help if you are going to arrest him.
For your own good, stay out of this affair.
I sense a great deal of confusion in you, young Skywalker.
There is much fear that clouds your judgment.
I must go, Master.
No.
If what you told me is true, you will have gained my trust, but for now remain here.
Thank you, Commander
Anakin, deliver this report to the Chancellor.
Yes, Master.
Master Windu,
I take it General Grievous has been destroyed then.
I must say, you' re here sooner than I expected.
In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you are under arrest, Chancellor.
Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?
The Senate will decide your fate.
- I am the Senate!
- Not yet!
It' s treason, then.
My Lord.
Anakin!
I told you it would come to this.
I was right.
The Jedi are taking over.
The oppression of the Sith will never return.
you have lost...
No!
No!
You will die!
He is a traitor, Anakin.
He' s the traitor.
I have the power to save the one you love.
You must choose.
Don' t listen to him, Anakin.
Don' t let him kill me.
I can' t hold on any longer...
I can' t...
I am weak...
I am too weak.
Anakin, help me!
I can' t...
I can' t hold on any longer...
I am going to end this once and for all.
You can' t...
He must stand trial.
He has control of the Senate and the Courts.
He is too dangerous to be left alive.
I' m too weak.
Don' t kill me.
Please.
It is not the Jedi way...
He must live...
Please don' t...
I need him... please don' t...
Unlimited power!
What have I done?
Anakin.
Become my apprentice.
Learn to use the dark side of the Force.
I will do whatever you ask.
Good.
Just help me save Padme' s life.
I can' t live without her.
To cheat death is a power only one has achieved, but if we work together,
I know we can discover the secret.
I pledge myself to your teachings.
Good.
Good.
The Force is strong with you.
A powerful Sith you will become.
Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth Vader.
Thank you. my Master.
Rise.
Because the Council did not trust you, my young apprentice,
I believe you are the only Jedi with no knowledge of this plot.
When the Jedi learn what has transpired here, they will kill us, along with all the Senators.
I agree.
The Council' s next move will be against the Senate.
Every single Jedi, including your friend Obi- Wan Kenobi, is now an enemy of the Republic.
I understand, Master.
We must move quickly.
The Jedi are relentless; if they are not all destroyed, it will be civil war without end.
First, I want you to go to the Jedi Temple.
We will catch them off balance.
Do what must be done, Lord Vader.
Do not hesitate.
Show no mercy.
Only then will you be strong enough with the dark side to save Padme.
What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy?
Their betrayal will be dealt with.
After you have killed all the Jedi in the Temple, go to the Mustafar system.
Wipe out Viceroy Gunray and the other Separatist leaders.
Once more, the Sith will rule the galaxy, and we shall have peace.
Commander, contact your troops.
Tell them to move to the higher levels.
Very good, sir.
Oh, by the way, I think you' il be needing this.
Thank you, Cody.
Now let' s get a move on.
We' ve got a battle to win here.
Yes, sir!
Commander Cody, the time has come.
Execute Order Sixty- Six.
Yes, My Lord.
Blast him!
Execute Order Sixty- Six.
It will be done, My Lord.
Master Skywalker, there are too many of them.
What are we going to do?
The Chancellor' s office indicated Master Anakin returned to the Jedi Temple.
Don' t worry, My Lady.
I am sure he will be all right.
What' s going on here?!
There' s been a rebellion, sir,
Don' t worry, the situation is under control.
I' m sorry, sir.
It' s time for you to leave.
And so it is.
Get him!
Shoot him!
All these Wookiees are dead.
Move to the east.
Yes, sir.
Good- bye Tarfful.
Good- bye Chewbacca.
miss you I will.
Hopefully we will be able to intercept a few Jedi before they walk into this catastrophe.
Did you find Kenobi?
Sir, no one could have survived that fall.
Start loading your men on the ship.
Move it!
Emergency Code Nine Thirteen...
I have no contact on any frequency.
Master Kenobi?
Repeat.
- Master Kenobi?
- Senator Organa!
My Clone Troops turned on me...
I need help.
We have just rescued Master Yoda.
It appears this ambush has happened everywhere.
We' re sending you our coordinates.
- Are you all right?
I heard there was an attack on the Jedi Temple... you can see the smoke from here.
I' m fine.
I came to see if you and the baby are safe.
What' s happening?
The Jedi have tried to overthrow the Republic...
I can' t believe that!
I saw Master Windu attempt to assassinate the Chancellor myself.
Oh, Anakin what are you going to do?
I will not betray the Republic... my loyalties lie with the Chancellor and with the Senate and with you.
What about Obi- Wan?
I don' t know.
Many Jedi have been killed.
We can only hope that he' s remained loyal to the Chancellor.
Anakin, I' m afraid.
Have faith, my love.
Everything will soon be set right.
The Chancellor has given me a very important mission.
The Separatists have gathered in the Mustafar system.
I' m going there to end this war.
Wait for me until I return... things will be different, I promise.
Please, wait for me.
Well, he is under a lot of stress, Artoo.
Take care, my little friend.
My Lady, is there anything I might do?
No thank you, Threepio.
I feel so helpless.
How many other Jedi managed to survive?
Heard from no one, have we.
I saw thousands of troops attack the Jedi Temple.
That' s why I went looking for Yoda.
Have we had any contact from the Temple?
Received a coded retreat message, we have.
It requests all Jedi to return to the Temple.
- It says that the war is over...
- Well, then we must go back!
If there are other stragglers, they will fall into the trap and be killed.
Suggest dismantling the coded signal, do you?
Yes, Master.
There is too much at stake.
I agree. and a little more knowledge might light our way.
The plan has gone as you had promised, My Lord.
You have done well, Viceroy.
When my new apprentice,
Darth Vader, arrives, he will take care of you.
We are receiving a message from the Chancellor' s office, sir.
- Yes, sir.
Senator Organa... the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic requests your presence at a special session of Congress.
I will be there.
He will be expecting you.
It could be a trap.
No, I don' t think so.
The Chancellor will not be able to control the thousands of star systems without keeping the Senate intact.
If a special session of Congress there is, easier for us to enter the Jedi Temple it will be.
Artoo... stay with the ship.
Welcome, Lord Vader.
We' ve been expecting you.
and the Jedi Rebellion has been foiled.
- What' s happening?
- The Chancellor has been elaborating on a plot by the Jedi, to overthrow the Senate.
The remaining Jedi will be hunted down and defeated.
Not even the younglings survived.
Killed not by clones, this Padawan.
By a lightsaber, he was.
Who?
Who could have done this?
but I assure you my resolve has never been stronger.
In order to ensure our security and continuing stability, the Republic will be reorganized into the first Galactic Empire, for a safe and secure society.
So this is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause...
The war is over.
Lord Sidious promised us peace... we only want...
I' ve recalibrated the code warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.
For the Clones to discover the recalibration, a long time it will take.
Wait, Master.
There is something I must know.
If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find.
I must know the truth, Master.
It can' t be...
It can' t be...
You have done well, my new apprentice.
Now, Lord Vader, now go and bring peace to the Empire.
I can' t watch any more.
Destroy the Sith, we must.
Send me to kill the Emperor.
I will not kill Anakin.
To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough, you are not.
He is like my brother...
I cannot do it.
Twisted by the dark side, young Skywalker has become.
The boy you trained, gone he is...
Consumed by Darth Vader.
I do not know where the Emperor has sent him.
I don' t know where to look.
Use your feelings, Obi- Wan, and find him, you will.
When was the last time you saw him?
- Yesterday.
- And do you know where he is now?
No.
Padme, I need your help.
- He' s in grave danger.
- From the Sith?
From himself...
Padme, Anakin has turned to the dark side.
You' re wrong!
How could you even say that?
I have seen a security hologram of him killing younglings.
Not Anakin!
He couldn' t!
He was deceived by a lie.
We all were.
It appears that the Chancellor is behind everything, including the war.
Palpatine is the Sith Lord we' ve been looking for.
After the death of Count Dooku, Anakin became his new apprentice.
I don' t believe you...
I can' t.
Padme,
I must find him.
You' re going to kill him, aren' t you?
He has become a very great threat.
I can' t...
Anakin is the father, isn' t he?
I' m so sorry.
My Lady, let me come with you.
There is no danger.
The fighting is over, and this is personal.
As you wish, My Lady but I strongly disagree.
I' il be all right, Captain.
This is something I must do myself.
Besides, Threepio will look after me.
Green light.
I think I' m beginning to get the hang of this flying business.
The Separatists are taken care of, My Master.
It is finished, then.
You have restored peace and justice to the galaxy.
Send a message to the ships of the Trade Federation.
All droid units must shut down immediately.
Very good, My Lord.
I saw your ship.
What are you doing out here?
I was so worried about you.
Obi- Wan told me terrible things.
What things?
He said you have turned to the dark side... that you killed younglings.
Obi- Wan is trying to turn you against me.
He cares about us.
- Us?
- He knows.
He wants to help you.
Anakin, all I want is your love.
Love won' t save you, Padme.
Only my new powers can do that.
At what cost?
You are a good person.
Don' t do this.
I won' t lose you the way I lost my mother!
I' ve become more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of and I' ve done it for you.
To protect you.
Come away with me.
Help me raise our child.
Leave everything else behind while we still can.
Don' t you see, we don' t have to run away anymore.
I have brought peace to the Republic.
I am more powerful than the Chancellor.
I can overthrow him, and together you and I can rule the galaxy.
Make things the way we want them to be.
I don' t believe what I' m hearing...
Obi- Wan was right.
You' ve changed.
I don' t want to hear any more about Obi- Wan.
The Jedi turned against me.
Don' t you turn against me.
I don' t know you anymore.
Anakin, you' re breaking my heart.
You are going down a path I can' t follow.
Because of Obi- Wan?
Because of what you' ve done... what you plan to do.
Stop, stop now.
Come back!
I love you.
Liar!
You' re with him.
You brought him here to kill me!
Let her go, Anakin.
Let her go!
You turned her against me.
You have done that yourself.
You will not take her from me.
Your anger and your lust for power have already done that.
You have allowed this Dark Lord to twist your mind until now... until now you have become the very thing you swore to destroy.
Don' t lecture me, Obi- Wan.
I see through the lies of the Jedi.
I do not fear the dark side as you do.
I have brought peace, freedom, justice and security to my new Empire.
Your new Empire?
Don' t make me kill you.
Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic... to democracy.
If you' re not with me, you' re my enemy.
Only a Sith Lord deals in absolutes.
I will do what I must.
You will try.
I hear a new apprentice, you have, Emperor, or should I call you Darth Sidious.
Master Yoda, you survived.
Surprised?
Your arrogance blinds you, Master Yoda.
Now you will experience the full power of the dark side.
I have waited a long time for this moment, my little green friend.
At last, the Jedi are no more.
Not if anything to say about it, I have.
At an end your rule is and not short enough it was.
If so powerful you are, why leave?
You will not stop me.
Darth Vader will become more powerful than either of us.
Faith in your new apprentice, misplaced may be, as is your faith in the dark side of the Force.
Hurry.
Careful timing we will need.
Activate your homing beacon when you' re ready.
There is no sign of his body, sir.
Then he is not dead.
Double your search.
Yes sir.
Right away, sir.
Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle for immediate takeoff.
Yes, Master.
I sense Lord Vader is in danger.
Into exile I must go.
Failed, I have.
I have failed you, Anakin.
I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over...
Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil.
From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.
Well, then you are lost!
This is the end for you, My Master.
It' s over, Anakin.
I have the high ground.
You underestimate my power!
Don' t try it.
You were the Chosen One!
It was said that you would, destroy the Sith, not join them.
bring balance to the Force, not leave it in Darkness.
I hate you!
You were my brother, Anakin.
I loved you.
Master Kenobi!
We have Miss Padme on board.
Yes.
Please, please hurry.
We should leave this dreadful place.
Obi- Wan?
Is Anakin all right?
Your Majesty, this way!
There he is.
He' s still alive.
Get a medical capsule, immediately.
Yes sir.
Right away.
Excuse me, Master Yoda.
Obi- Wan Kenobi has made contact.
We' il take her to the medical center, quickly.
Medically, she is completely healthy.
For reasons we can' t explain, we are losing her.
She' s dying?
We don' t know why.
She has lost the will to live.
We need to operate quickly if we are to save the babies.
- Babies?
- She' s carrying twins.
Luke...
Oh Luke.
It' s a girl.
Leia.
Obi- Wan...
there... is good in him.
I know...
I know there is... still...
Lord Vader, can you hear me?
Yes, Master.
Where is Padme?
Is she safe, is she all right?
it seems in your anger, you killed her.
I couldn' t have!
She was alive!
I felt her!
Hidden, safe, the children must be kept.
We must take them somewhere the Sith will not sense their presence.
Split up, they should be.
My wife and I will take the girl.
We' ve always talked of adopting a baby girl.
She will be loved with us.
And what of the boy?
To Tatooine.
To his family, send him.
I will take the child and watch over him.
Until the time is right, disappear we will.
Master Kenobi, wait a moment.
In your solitude on Tatooine, training I have for you.
Training?
An old friend has learned the path to immortality.
One who has returned from the netherworld of the Force... your old Master,
Qui- Gon?
I will teach you.
Captain Antilles.
- Yes, Your Highness.
- I' m placing these droids in your care.
Treat them well.
Clean them up.
Have the Protocol Droid' s mind wiped.
What?
Oh no.
Good evening, pilot.
Good evening, father.
I have a package for his eminence.
I will see that he receives it.
Oh, forgive me, father, but i swore that i would place it in his hands myself.
Wait here.
Ah, it' s good to see you, father alvito.
I' m pleased your journey was a safe one.
Ah, by the grace of god.
You must tell me about it later, but now his eminence is waiting.
Vasco rodrigues, your eminence.
You have a package for me, my son?
From father sebastio in anjiro.
I swore to place it in your hands.
Would that all vows were so dutifully obeyed.
Thank you, my son.
It' s the english pilot' s rutter.
Yes... i want you to read it all tonight.
If the rutter proves that they' re pirates, which, of course, they are, then the man has damned himself.
Yes, your eminence.
Why has he come here?
Why now, when we' re almost safe again?
As god is my judge, if i didn' t know better, i' d believe that the spaniards, or their benedictine lackeys, had deliberately guided him here to plague us.
Perhaps they did, your eminence.
May god show them the error of their ways.
Where are we going?
Toranaga- sama?
You understand, um, uh... wakarimasu ka?
Where?
You' re an unpleasant little bugger, aren' t you?
Hai?
Hai.
That' s what i thought.
Anjin- san...
dozo.
Yoshi toranaga, lord of the kwanto.
My name is martin alvito of the society of jesus, captain- pilot.
Lord toranaga has asked me to interpret for him.
First, tell him that we are enemies.
All in good time.
Vasco rodrigues has told me of your bravery.
Tell lord toranaga that i do not trust you to translate what i say.
You would be wise to reconsider.
Lord toranaga has favored me with his confidence for many years.
Perhaps i should point out that i' m quite apart from father sebastio, who is, unfortunately, overzealous, and does not speak japanese very well.
His own experience here is limited, and your sudden presence took away god' s grace from him... regrettably.
Tell him.
You may tell him yourself.
The japanese word for "enemy" is teki.
lord toranaga will understand clearly what you mean.
Teki.
Mariko...
hai.
lord toranaga will have the lady toda explain your responses.
I can have no objection to that, but since the lady is to convey my words, i would like to be introduced.
Lord toranaga has agreed.
What is your full name?
Pilot- major john blackthorne.
Pilot- major john blackthorne, may i present the lady toda buntaro- mariko.
I am honored, lady.
"If you are english, why were you leading dutch ships?"
That is not unusual.
Holland and england are allies, and i was glad for the opportunity to sail into these waters.
No english ships were planning to come this far, but we' re a trading fleet, though we have letters of mark to attack the enemy in the new world.
We came to japan to trade.
"What are letters of mark?"
Legal licenses issued by the crown, our government, giving authority to war on the enemy.
"And since your enemy is here, do you plan to war on them here?"
If they war on me.
"but here, there is one law for all,
"will be dealt with immediately by death.
"My laws are clear and will be obeyed.
Do you understand? "
Yes, sire, but we come in peace.
We came here to trade.
Could we discuss trade, sire?
I need to careen my ship and make repairs.
We can pay for everything.
And then there' s the question...
"when i wish to discuss trade or anything else,
"i will tell you.
"Meanwhile, please confine yourself to answering the questions."
"So, you joined the expedition to trade for profit... not because of duty or loyalty, for money?"
Yes.
It is our custom to be paid, sire.
And i have a share in all... all goods captured from the enemy.
"So, you are a mercenary?"
I was hired as senior pilot to lead the expedition, yes.
But i am not a pirate.
"What is a pirate?"
An outlaw:
A man who kills, rapes, and plunders for personal profit.
"Isn' t that the same as a mercenary?
"Isn' t that what you are, a pirate and the leader of pirates?"
No, sire, i am not a pirate.
The portuguese and spanish will tell you that because we' re at war.
What did he say?
"What i said is no concern of yours.
When i wish you to know something, i will tell you. "
I' m sorry, lord toranaga, i did not mean to be rude.
"Then hold your tongue until i require an answer."
Lord toranaga says that i have told him that holland was a vassal of the spanish until a few years ago.
He asks you if that is true.
Yes.
"Then your ally holland
"is fighting against its lawful king.
Is that true? "
They' re fighting against spain, yes, but... "isn' t that rebellion?
Yes or no? "
Yes, but there are mitigating circumstances, serious mitigating circumstances.
"There are no mitigating circumstances when it comes to rebellion against a sovereign lord."
Unless you win.
Foreigner with the impossible name,
"yes... you name the one mitigating factor.
Will you win? "
Yes.
Hai, we will win.
How long did it take you to travel here?
Almost two years.
Exactly one year, 11 months and two days.
"How did you come?
By what route? "
By the pass of magellan.
If i had my maps and rutters, i could show you clearly.
But they were stolen.
They were removed from my cabin with my letters of mark and all my papers.
"You claim all your papers were removed?"
Yes.
You are to come over here, captain- pilot, away from the door.
If you value your life, don' t move suddenly or say anything.
What' s going on?
You will be a dead man the next time you speak.
Lord ishido, master of osaka castle.
Lord toranaga asks that you stand.
Move slowly and do not speak.
Lord ishido says you are a pirate.
Captain- pilot, you are to follow this man.
Where am i going?
You are to be detained.
Where?
For how long?
I do not know, my son.
Until lord toranaga decides.
Thank you for your help, lady.
You are quite welcome, pilot- major blackthorne.
Like hell, i will.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Uh... me, anjin- san.
Anjin- san.
You?
Anjin- san.
Anjin- san.
Ji... jirobei.
Jirobei- san.
Hai.
I don' t understand.
Wakarimasin.
in nomine patri et fili et spiritus sancti.
Mother of god!
Art thou real?
Yes.
Who are you?
Oh, blessed virgin.
Real. "who are you?"
L- i, l- i am friar domingo of the sacred order of saint francis.
My prayers have been answered.
I thought i was seeing another apparition... a ghost.
The evil spirit... yes, l- i' ve seen so many, so many.
How long have you been here?
Yesterday.
And you?
Oh, a long time.
L- i don' t know.
I was put here in september, in the year of our lord 1598.
It' s may now... 1600.
1600?
Come with me, my son.
They are my flock.
They are all my sons in the blessed lord jesus.
I' ve made so many converts here.
This one' s john.
That' s mark... methuselah.
Please... sit down, my son.
You must be tired.
One of my flock says that you are a pilot, an anjin.
Is this so?
Yes.
You came from manila?
No, i' ve never been in asia before.
Why- why are you here?
Jesuits put me here, my son.
Jesuits and their filthy lies.
You are not spanish?
No.
Nor portuguese?
Was your ship portuguese?
Tell me the truth, before god.
No, father, it was not portuguese... before god.
Of course.
Your ship was spanish.
Spanish.
And you were shipwrecked, like us.
Foully thrown into this jail.
Falsely accused by those devil jesuits.
God curse them, and show them the error of their treachery.
You said you had never been in asia before?
This is my first time.
You will be like a child in the wilderness, my son.
Oh, there' s so much to tell.
Did you know that jesuits are merely traders?
Gunrunners?
Usurers?
And that the black ship is worth a million in gold to them every year?
Black ship?
What is the black ship?
That is why the jesuits are here, my son.
They control all the silk trade, all the trade with china.
Selling silk in japan alone is worth a fortune to them, and once a year, the black ship takes their ungodly profits back to europe, to fill their filthy coffers ever further.
You have never heard of this, my son?
No, never.
How did that happen?
The jesuits have forced his holiness the pope to grant them total power over all asia... them and their dogs, the portuguese.
Yeah.
The jesuits deal in gold, reveling in their profits against the direct orders of his holiness, pope clement, and of our king phillip.
Yes, and even against the laws of this land.
They meddle in politics, and lie and cheat and bear false witness against us, my son.
Their lies and poison put me here.
I must tend my flock.
There are converts here and... little time.
Sit here, my son.
You will be safe here.
Shimsama.
Domo arigato.
Korewa anjin- san.
Oh, i' m sorry, my son.
I... i did not mean to disturb you.
We thought... we thought you might be thirsty when you awaken.
Dozo.
Thank you.
How do you say that in japanese?
Domo.
Sometimes you say "arigato."
A woman must always be very polite.
She says "arigato goziemashita."
What' s his name?
He' s gonzalez.
No, his, uh, japanese name.
Ah, yes, ah, uh... kagoya.
But that just means "porter."
They don' t have names.
Only the samurai have names.
What do you mean?
Only the samurai have names.
First names and surnames, and everyone else is known by what they do.
Porter or... fisherman, cook... domo, kagoya- san.
Only yesterday you said you- you came here only yesterday.
What occurred with you, my son?
When we landed, there was a jesuit there.
Jesuits come from hell.
God curse them.
Oh... god forgive my foolish rage.
Ayiko yodoro!
Ji nomi!
Nokoro hajiro!
Koyano kanski!
Kanski, suyi!
What' s going to happen to him?
He will be executed.
Are you sure?
His calvary is outside the door.
May the holy madonna take his soul swiftly and give him everlasting reward.
What did he do?
He broke the law, my son... their law.
The japanese are a simple people.
They have only one punishment:
Death.
You forget about imprisonment.
That is not one of their punishments, my son.
To them, prison... is a temporary place where they keep a man till they decide his sentence, and that sentence is always death.
Oh, only the guilty come here, for just a little while.
But you' ve been here almost two years.
like all the others.
This is a resting place between the hell of earth and the glory of everlasting life.
But you' re not guilty of anything.
Then i am the one exception.
Perhaps... perhaps it is the will of god.
Perhaps those devil jesuits are keeping me alive to torture me.
It is so hard to be patient.
So very hard.
What is it, my son?
Nothing, father.
Go back to sleep.
There is nothing to fear.
We are all in god' s hands.
How are you today, my son?
Fine.
Thank you, father.
And you?
I' m quite well.
Thank you.
How do you say that in japanese?
Domo, genki desu.
Domo, genki desu.
Has anyone ever tried to break out of here?
No, no.
Why should they?
There' s nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.
To help an escaped prisoner is punishable by death.
You' re here, even if all you do is not report a crime.
Even that will take you to the cross.
Do not think of it, my son.
- No.
- No.
- Tell me more, father...
- hmm?
About the black ship.
Have you ever seen one?
Oh, yes.
They are the greatest ships in the world.
Almost 2, 000 tons.
As many as 200 men are needed to sail one.
How many guns do they hold?
Mm, sometimes 20 or 30.
Three decks.
Then she probably lumbers when the wind' s abeam.
I don' t understand.
Big but slow.
The black ship?
Ah, yes.
Domo.
Denkides.
Oh, you remembered.
If only i had ink and quill and paper, i could write the words down for you.
Would you teach me anyway, father?
I want to learn.
Yes, of course.
Here.
Let- let us trace the words in the dirt.
You' il remember them.
Dozo is "please."
Water.
Mizu.
Yeah.
And "please wait"... mate... kudasai.
Mate kudasai.
Mate kudasai.
Now you write.
Anjin- san!
Your confession, my son, say it quickly.
I don' t think i... very quickly, my son, and i will give you absolution.
Be quick for your immortal soul.
Just say that you... you confess before god all things past and present.
Say it now.
The blessed virgin will watch over you.
Go with god, father.
Castlegard.
Clear!
- 250.
- 250 ready.
Clear!
- 300.
- 300 ready.
Clear!
He' s gone.
It' s over 100 degrees out there.
He grabs me with ice- cold hands.
Apart from external wounds, everything is out of alignment.
Even his veins are out of alignment.
Now, wait.
Look at the heart.
The aorta doesn' t line up.
And now the spine.
Same thing.
Same shift right across the third vertebrae.
This guy looks like a paper doll got cut up and pasted back together.
No wallet.
No lD.
Just this thing around his neck.
It says lTC on it, so we called them.
- That outfit in the desert.
- Our biggest contributors.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Frank Gordon, lTC.
I' m here to pick up Vince Taub' s body.
I' m Dr. Cova.
I' il take care of that paperwork.
Thank you.
Vincent Taub, huh?
That' s Vinnie' s good- luck charm.
Thank you.
Pretty sad when your time comes and no one claims you but your employer.
- Excuse me, sheriff.
- Sure.
Gordon.
I' m picking up the body right now.
- Was he alone or with Decker?
- Taub' s the only one here.
- Get the body out of there.
- And x- rays and records.
Get everything, OK?
Will it be a problem?
No, there' s no problem.
They' ve been very accommodating.
If this gets out, lTC is ruined.
Any idea how he ended up in the desert?
I don' t know.
Maybe he used his marker without enough clearance.
- It could be a million things.
- Not too bright.
He' s dead, Robert.
Taub is dead.
Oh, Mr. Gordon, by the way, what' s Castlegard?
I heard that' s the only word he said, "Castlegard".
Sounds like an amusement park.
Listen up, class.
Castlegard, France.
The English army in their red uniforms occupied the village of Castlegard.
The French, meanwhile, were advancing, trying to drive them out of there, in this direction over the river, past the monastery and up and over to the heights here.
Just leave it, Chris, that' s fine, before you wreck the place.
The English army, meanwhile, had retreated to Castle La Roque.
Well fortified, very strong, very well supplied, and both sides had settled in for a long siege.
The French were trying to push the English out of France.
Lord Oliver tries to take the fight out of the French.
Now, he has a prisoner, a woman.
A woman of class and a woman of nobility,
Commander Arnaut' s sister, Lady Claire.
He hangs her from the battlements for all of the French forces to see.
Instead of demoralizing the French, it whips them into a frenzy, and they attack the castle like madmen, and they overpower the English with sheer passion.
So the fortress of La Roque fell in one night because of the death of one woman,
Lady Claire.
All right, that' s enough of the academics for today.
Go get your hands dirty.
Hi, Chris.
I got Marek' s clippers.
Oh, Chris, great.
Here, hold that, will you.
You can move it around if you like.
- I thought this would be a routine trip.
- It is.
Last time you cut off your beard, you sold the house and we moved to Kentucky for a year.
- Your mother wanted a change.
- How does this always happen to me?
I am older and very much wiser than you.
Have a beer.
It' il cool you down.
Very hot work, ironing.
I know something' s going on.
The beard' s coming off, so what' s really happening?
It' s these amazing finds we' ve been making.
Doniger' s been giving us too many tips.
- He' s a lucky zillionaire.
- Nobody' s that lucky.
He knows something he' s not saying.
Something isn' t right about this.
He' s been ducking me.
I' m gonna get a few answers.
Maybe scrounge a couple of bucks.
Put that in my bag, would you?
And don' t wrinkle it.
I' d appreciate it if you don' t tell anybody about this.
Especially Kate.
- Why would I tell Kate?
- Here.
Have a wee run round that, would you?
"Why would I tell Kate?"
You see me twice a year, stay until you' re bored to distraction.
I think the record' s three weeks.
Maybe I' m just really beginning to enjoy archeology.
From a boy who hated Easter because he had to find eggs.
- That' s beside the point.
- That' s beside the point.
You' re still here because of Kate.
Chris.
Look, son,
I love you, but you' re scorching my shirt.
Sorry.
You and Kate are from different worlds.
You saw how that turned out between your mother and me.
Yeah, but, Dad, no offense, I' m not like you.
But Kate is.
Trust me, if it' s between archeology and you, you' il lose.
- Sorry.
- I' m sorry.
I brought you a beer.
- That' s so sweet.
- Half a beer anyways.
Half a beer.
- What you got going on here?
- The stairs.
The ones you were talking about?
Where do they go?
Now they don' t go anywhere, but they' il lead me to my tunnel which will go all the way to La Roque.
What do you say I help you out?
Show me what to do.
- I thought you hated this stuff.
- No, I don' t hate it.
I need a break.
- You have the full one.
- That' s sweet of you.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- Thank you.
- You' re welcome.
Think you' il follow in your father' s footsteps?
- No.
- No.
No way.
Actually, I' m not really all that interested in the past.
No?
What are you interested in then?
I think I already know the answer to that question.
I' ve been hoping that you' d notice.
I' ve been hoping you' d quit hoping I' d notice.
So there' s nothing there?
- Chris, you are the boss' son.
- So... there is something there.
It' s late.
But thanks for the beer.
- Haven' t been practicing, have you?
- I' m not getting any younger.
- You love this stuff.
- It' s a habit I can' t quite kick.
Let me take that from you before you cut something you' il need later.
So talking about love,
- how did it go last night?
- It didn' t.
So how does it feel being passed over for 600- year- old ruins?
It sucks.
It sucks big time.
I don' t understand you guys.
You live in the past.
You know what the past is to me?
The past is why my parents split up.
The past is what I' ve been force- fed since I was little.
None of you archeologists looks to the future.
What are you talking about?
What is the future but just more of the same?
More gadgets, more machines like that thing you rode up on.
It' s the past is where it' s at, you know.
People then, they cared about each other.
- Men had honor, you know?
- No, no.
You know what that is to me?
Romantic warrior crap.
Romantic?
You want to see romantic?
Follow me.
Come on.
Come on!
What have you got?
Oh, another stone sticking out of the ground.
No, it' s a 600- year- old sarcophagus with a French knight and his lady.
- Look, isn' t she beautiful?
- She' s a real knockout.
Very funny.
Another thing, down here, they' re holding hands.
- lncredibly unusual for that period.
- That is kind of unusual, huh?
Oh, God, over here.
This knight has only got one ear.
What happened there?
What, one ear?
That piece is missing.
It' s somewhere here in the dirt.
I' m the archeologist.
It was carved that way.
- Fair enough.
- Trust me.
Who do you think they were?
Why would somebody that doesn' t give a shit be concerned with that?
- See?
- What you wanted to hear?
- Yeah.
We' re all intrigued by this.
That' s why we' re all here.
It' s not just about the rocks and the rubble.
It' s about these people.
Who were they?
And what were their stories?
It helps us to understand where we came from, or where we' re going.
- You know what I like to say.
- "You make your own history."
- Do I say it that often?
- Yeah, all the time.
Well, whoever they were, they made theirs together.
It' s best to go really, really slow.
It' s better to be cautious.
Come on.
Hurry up!
Cave- in at the monastery!
Cave- in at the monastery!
I was standing and the floor gave way underneath my feet.
- How long has it been open?
- 1 5 minutes.
We have five minutes before oxygen contamination.
- Let' s move it.
- Be careful.
- It' s under where I was working.
- I don' t know about this.
Can everybody listen up?
Let' s be careful, we got that?
I' ve got your back.
Be safe.
- Who' s going in first?
- OK, let' s go.
- Who' s going down first?
- On belay!
- OK, take me down nice and slow.
- Give me a radio check.
- Please be careful.
- OK, one- two.
Do you read me?
- We' re good.
That' s good.
Just keep it steady.
- Lower Kate down.
- Lower me down.
Easy, guys.
Nice and slow.
Nice and slow.
I' m getting close to the first level.
- Easy!
- Bring me down, guys.
- A little more on Marek.
- Smell the stale air.
Kate, be careful down there.
I' m down.
Oh, my God.
This is right below where I was working.
Are you all right?
What' s going on?
"All right?" "All right" is not the word.
- Give me slack on the rope.
- More slack!
- Come on, guys.
- Oh, my God.
- This is unbelievable.
We are the first people in this room for 600 years.
These...
These...... are beautiful.
You won' t believe the condition of these...
- What have you got?
- Come here.
No way.
This is too much.
Oh, my God.
- What is it?
- Oh, my God.
An old document box.
We' ve got an oilskin with documents inside.
- Look at the condition of this thing!
- OK, let' s be really careful.
Quick, get the bag.
- I can' t believe this.
- That is gonna be such a find.
Careful, careful, careful.
Let' s get this up.
I need the light for a minute.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
- Oh, man!
- Give me the light.
- What kind of...
- It' s amazing.... son of a bitch would deliberately damage something so beautiful?
Obviously not an archeologist.
We' ve gotta get out of here.
Let' s go!
Guys, we' re coming up!
Pull it up!
Come on!
We want to go up quick, OK?
- Hold this.
- What are you doing, Marek?
- It' s OK.
- What are you doing?
It' s definitely a modern- day bifocal lens.
I know.
And bifocals weren' t invented until the mid- 1 700s.
The hole only opened up today, Stern.
There' s been nobody down that chamber before Kate and l.
If you think that' s weird, you' il love this.
- What is this?
- One of the documents you found.
It' s just a simple list of the things stored in there.
Nothing special.
And then we found this.
Look.
The professor?
"Help me"?
"E. A. Johnston"?
- "4/ 2/ 1357"?
- 1357.
- E. A. Johnston.
- What is going on?
I cross- matched the signatures.
It' s definitely his handwriting.
But he' s only been gone for two days.
Your father wrote that, but he wrote it 600 years ago.
What' s going on here?
Francois is looking for his spare pair.
I' il see if the prescriptions match.
So you' re telling me this is the professor' s and it' s 600 years old?
- What have you been smoking?
- Maybe you can explain.
If I knew, I' d explain it.
All I know is that the ink is 600 years old.
I know.
This is my father.
This is him.
- He' s just playing a prank.
No, there is no way he would risk contaminating the site as a joke.
He just wouldn' t.
- Did you carbon- date the ink?
- Of course.
- There' s got to be another reason.
- I did it three times.
Like I just said, your father wrote that note, but he wrote it 600 years ago.
I don' t care about lTC' s policies.
I' m his son, I wanna talk to him now.
I found the professor' s glasses.
They were on his desk.
Look.
We should do an optical test to make sure.
I' m sick of this.
Either somebody tell me where Professor Johnston is or I report a kidnapping to the authorities.
Have I made myself clear?
Just tell us when and where.
What is it?
Doniger' s sending a plane for us.
We' re going to New Mexico?
Let' s pack up, guys.
Good morning.
Steven Kramer, lTC.
Frank Gordon, security.
- Where' s my dad?
- You' il see your dad shortly.
- Where' s Doniger at?
- Doniger' s waiting inside.
- Mr. Kramer will explain everything.
- Tell me.
How come we have a 600- year- old document
- with his handwriting?
- Pleading for help.
I' il explain as soon as we get through security.
ITC is constantly advancing itself in science.
30 years ago, the business world was revolutionized with a machine that sent documents anywhere with the push of a button.
Doniger' s vision was to do that with 3- D objects.
- Like a fax or something?
- Exactly.
He' s trying to send actual objects from one place to another?
- Follow me.
- But that' s impossible.
He would need a quantum computer with millions of processors.
We used them to build a machine that could fax three- dimensional objects.
I' il explain these mirrors later.
It would put FedEx and UPS out of business.
- You actually made it work?
- Yes.
Across a room.
But we wanted to send things across continents so we built a bigger machine.
This is the prototype.
The prototype?
So that thing that we just passed...
- Exactly. -... is the real thing?
We gave it a thousand times more power.
We tried to send something from New Mexico to a twin machine at a lab in New York City.
Now, here' s the interesting part.
The package never arrived at its destination.
A few hours later, it showed up back here.
Wait a minute.
So if it went missing between New Mexico and New York,
- where did it go in the meantime?
- We asked the same question.
So we sent out a camera over and over, and we got back photos of the same location, a hillside with trees.
That' s when Mr. Doniger made the brilliant decision to point the camera straight up.
So once we cross- referenced star charts to the horizon, we realized that the camera was not only in the wrong place,
- but it was in the wrong time.
- So, what does that mean?
The camera was taking photographs of a wilderness near Castlegard, France in the year 1 357.
So you' re saying you accidentally discovered time travel?
No, we accidentally discovered a wormhole.
A wormhole that seems to be locked to a single time and place in the past:
1 357, Castlegard.
So you faxed my father' s glasses and documents back to the 1 4th century?
No, Chris.
Your father is in the 1 4th century.
What?
- We need you to help get him back.
- Mr. Robert Doniger, this doesn' t make sense.
A wormhole is a volatile force.
You can' t send a person through one.
Can' t fit a piece of paper through a telephone wire.
But you can send a fax.
Sure, once you' ve broken the message into a stream of electrons, but...
- Oh, shit.
- Now, look,
I don' t care about the hows or the whys.
I care about my father.
Did he know about all this?
We' d give him hints
We' d give him hints about the best excavation areas, and he could discover why we' re locked into this particular place and time.
So this is why you' ve been funding our dig.
He was more astute than I thought.
We gave him too many clues and he became very, very suspicious.
How could you send him there?
God knows where he is...
Oh, he' s a very persuasive man.
He insisted on going.
- Now he' s stuck.
- That' s where you all come in.
Do we look like wormhole specialists?
You sent the professor to the Hundred Years' War?
- Right.
- Turbulent times you sent him to.
We need cultural experts, not scientists.
My people don' t know about the medieval world or how to mingle, which is what we have to do if we are to find the professor and bring him back.
So we bring him back, it' s that simple.
We step on that machine and whiz back to 1357 to get him back?
Once he' s broken us into a stream of electrons.
- Why should we do what you ask us?
- I think we need to know more...
- I know you have a lot of questions...
- A lot of questions.
The professor' s already been gone for 72 hours and every minute he' s there, it' il be more difficult to find him.
- That' s true.
- Bob?
I need to get them changed if they' re going to go.
- Frank, change with them.
- I' m not going.
- Gomez and Baretto are ready.
- We need to think...
- I' d like you along.
- We didn' t say we were going.
Steve, can you bring them to prep, please.
Folks, this way.
Thank you.
Please, this way.
Thank you.
Just follow Steve.
He' il take you to the prep room.
Bob, look, Gomez and Baretto are my two best men.
They can handle any situation.
I would prefer not going.
I really want you to go.
And if you see Decker, you know what to do.
Robert...
You know, that was a really great speech you made.
I almost believed it myself.
- Didn' t you forget something?
- What?
Come on.
Look at Taub' s MRls.
Look at his arteries.
This was his tenth trip.
This is their first and only.
They deserve to know that we don' t know how he ended up in the desert.
You don' t think they deserve to know that?
I' ve told them enough.
How did my father get stuck back there?
Doniger gave him an hour.
Things got harried, and I lost him in the woods.
- You left him there.
- We have a limited time.
I had to come back or we' d both be stuck.
I guess it' s better him than you, right?
Listen, there' s a few things we have to go over before we leave.
They need your vital data.
It' s for your return process.
Change from your clothes into those clothes over there.
Anything you want.
Put your personals in the lockers.
I want to introduce you to two friends, Bill Baretto, Jimmy Gomez.
They' re coming with us.
Buddies from the Marines.
- Why do we need Marines?
- Just in case something goes wrong.
I like to have all my bases covered.
All right, let' s change up.
I can' t believe you' re considering this.
Do you understand what it does?
It strips you down to a molecular level, which means, for a moment, you cease to exist.
- Listen to him, he' s got a point.
Wait a second.
I don' t need you, Miss Ericson.
Or Chris.
- I need you.
You know the layout.
- Nobody knows it like I do.
- I go.
- There' s no way I' m not going.
I just said I' m not going, so don' t touch me!
Thanks.
Stern, we don' t need you back there.
You' re a physicist.
- I' m sorry.
But we are going to need you, Francois.
- Why do we need him?
- Because he speaks French fluently.
- He' s right.
- My high- school French sucks.
- Don' t do this.
- We need his help.
- I' il cover you.
- Don' t pressure him.
Francois, you have to make your own decision on this.
Your father would' ve done it for me, so, yes, I' il come.
- OK.
- Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Magnetic coils ready.
- Verifying now.
Platform up.
Computers are up, Mr. Doniger.
Tell Gordon we' ve got to get going.
Keep a couple of beers cold for me, all right?
Mr. Stern.
Watch our backs, OK?
It will be all right.
We' il be back before you know it.
- Take it easy, bro.
- You know the 50 bucks I owe you?
All right, let' s move it.
Frank, six hours and the clock is running.
Wear these personal markers around your neck.
You can use any one of them to call for your return.
Frank will explain their intricacies once you arrive.
Most importantly, one marker will bring all of you back.
- Do not lose them.
- What about weapons?
Nothing modern goes back.
Especially weapons.
- They' re set for a six- hour countdown.
- Countdown?
- They burn out after six hours.
- And then?
I' il get you back before you know it.
Oh.
Sorry, Francois, they didn' t have these back then.
I don' t see without...
You' il be fine.
That' s where we goofed with the professor.
I feel morally compelled to inform you that there is a degree of pain.
I' m told it' s rather intense, but extremely fleeting.
A couple of seconds.
No residual discomfort.
So forgive me, I didn' t want that to influence your decision.
- OK.
Good luck.
- Let' s do it.
You all look great.
Miss Ericson, you look divine.
Good luck.
Don' t worry about it.
You guys will be home for lunch.
- Think of it as the ultimate field trip.
- A fantastic thing for an archeologist.
- I can' t believe we' re doing this.
There are no railings.
Come watch.
Come watch.
- Yeah, I' m fine.
- Take a place around the perimeter.
- Spread out.
- Move around the platform.
Take a deep breath, relax.
We' il be back before you know it.
- Are we set?
- All systems check.
Come in, Josh.
Close the door.
- Good luck.
- Six hours and counting.
Mr. Marek?
Mr. Marek, I need you to take your position.
How' s everybody doing?
- What the hell are we doing?
- Getting the chance of a lifetime.
Nothing to worry about.
We' il take care of you.
Just relax.
Everything will be fine.
- DNA streams locked in.
- Thank you.
- OK, lock them in.
- Locking in.
- How long does it take?
- A couple of seconds.
Watch it here.
Mirrors locked.
Son of a...
Where is he?
Francois!
- Are you all right?
- Where' s Francois?
Francois?
- There he is!
- Francois!
Pull him out!
Now we wait.
Give me your hand!
- Come on!
- Francois, hold on!
Hold on!
Hold on!
- Here, take my hand.
- You all right?
You all right?
Everybody all right?
That was a close one.
All right.
Let' s head up this hill.
Everybody follow me up.
- Hell of a start.
- We' ve always arrived on land.
- Gordon, is this it?
- I think so.
You think so?
Are we in 1357 France?
- This could be Oregon.
- Gordon, where are we?
Shut up!
Trust me, we' re in 1357 France.
- Well, if this is France, I' m home.
- Come on, let' s go.
Let me explain the markers.
Press here, it shows the remaining time.
Squeeze it, it takes you home.
But don' t.
- Why?
- We haven' t found his dad yet.
One last thing...
- He said, "Hide".
Everyone hide.
- All right, take cover.
Let' s go!
Move!
Now!
Francois, come on!
Well done, Sir De Kere.
- After him.
- Yes, my lord.
Get the others.
Find out who they are.
Come on, quick.
Oh, God!
Baretto!
We got a field buck!
They' re coming back!
- Oh, my God.
- Get a medic!
Get a medic up here!
- What was that?
What was that?
- What?
What is that?
That' s a grenade!
Get down!
Oh, my God, he' s left.
Get down!
He' il see you!
You!
Over here!
Let' s go.
Come on, come on!
All right, let' s go.
Come on.
Chris!
Kate!
Marek!
Hey.
- Where' s my boys?
Where' s Marek?
- The guys came after Baretto.
He took some arrows and then he pressed his marker.
He' s gone.
He took two arrows, and he must have hit his marker.
- Where' s Gomez?
- I didn' t see him.
Oh, my God.
Don' t look.
- What are you doing?
I can' t find his marker.
You' re looking for his marker?
He' s dead!
- What are you doing?
- I' m getting us out of here.
- We' re not going anywhere.
- We can' t save anyone if we' re dead!
- Keep it quiet.
- You can' t do that.
Why not?!
You need 40 feet of clearance around all sides to work.
- What?
- I was trying to tell you.
Don' t lose these.
They' re precious.
And if you follow my lead, I will get your dad and get you home.
- Francois, it' s going to be OK.
- Let' s find Marek.
- What about Gomez?
- We can' t do anything about him now.
- We gotta go.
Look at me.
- Francois, come on.
Be quiet!
The soldiers!
You passed us.
You passed us in the woods.
It' s OK.
It' s OK.
- We' ve lost the trail.
- Damn it.
- Pick it up again.
- Yes, Sir De Kere.
Search down by the river.
Jesus, you' re a girl.
It' s OK.
After the French bastards!
After them!
Leave none living!
Careful.
- There you are.
- No.
Help!
Help!
Shut it off!
He knew not to take anything modern.
That son of a bitch brought a grenade back with him.
I can' t believe it.
The coils.
The coils.
Damn it!
He knew the regulations, no modern weapons!
- Gomez?
- The lines are online!
- Well...
- His marker.
- What happened to the rest of them?
- Get a medic over here!
- I don' t know.
- Give me your gloves.
Well, did anyone try to come back with him?
I don' t know.
I know as much as you, OK?
Hang on.
What if they' re trying to come back now?
- It' s not gonna happen...
- Don' t jump to conclusions.
You can' t leave seven people stuck back there!
- Tell me you have a backup plan...
- Shut up!
I don' t know.
I don' t know.
Please tell me you have a backup plan.
Yes, we have a backup plan.
Go!
Gordon!
Gordon!
It' s Marek!
Chris!
This Frenchwoman will lead us to Castlegard.
Great.
That' s great.
Let' s go.
Come on.
Wow.
The village of Castlegard.
We' re here.
Where is everyone going?
Hold on a second.
- What day is this?
- Marek...
It' s the fourth of April.
- Of course it is.
It' s April 4th.
- 1357.
- The day La Roque falls?
- Wait, wait.
- What are you talking about?
- You son of a bitch.
- Excuse me?
- You brought us back on the day the French attack.
By tonight, this whole place is gonna be burned to the ground.
Stop with the history and look for the professor.
Now, follow me.
Let' s go.
I' m a physicist.
Give me something to do.
I can help.
- Might as well be a pharmacist.
- Good one, Robert.
- Replacement panels are on their way.
- How long will this take?
Five hours and 27 minutes.
How do you know it' s gonna take 5 hours and 27 minutes?
Because that' s all the time we have.
Once this platform is fixed, even if the markers run out, we can send someone back to get them?
The thing holding the wormhole open is their markers.
But you' ve opened and closed it dozens of times.
- Once the platform...
- Look, we don' t even know what we did to link us to this wormhole.
A lucky calibration, chance impurity in the coils.
The point is, the grenade probably destroyed any possibility of re- creating it.
Once their markers expire, they could be stuck there forever?
- Is that what you' re saying?
- They could be.
Guys, come on.
Come on, come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on, this way.
Castle La Roque awaits its soldiers.
- The manor house.
- Look at that.
I can' t believe it.
We were just working on it.
That' s Castlegard, all right.
It' s different.
That right section, I had wrong.
- Where did that tower come from?
- What if my Dad' s in there?
- Yeah, you' re right.
- How are we gonna get in?
Guys, soldiers coming.
- You there!
- Come on.
Why aren' t you packing up?
- Run!
Run!
- Halt!
Stop!
- Go, go, go, go!
- Don' t let them get away!
Get that horse out of the way!
My lord!
- Pick him up.
- Come on, my friend.
- Who are they?
- We captured them in the village.
I am Lord Oliver.
Who speaks for you?
- I do, my lord.
- You speak strangely.
Yes, we are Scottish, my lord.
Scottish?
You' ve come to kill us all in our beds?
First the old man and now this group.
Why do the Scottish find this village so pleasing?
- It must be your lord' s kind manners.
- lndeed it must.
My lady.
- I beg your pardon, my lord.
- Let him speak.
- My lord, the old man you spoke of...
- Edward De Johnness?
He claims he' s a magister.
- Do you know of him?
- He' s our master, sir.
- All is well with him?
- He said he was alone.
We were several days behind him.
He does not know we are here.
Who are you?
Yes, you.
The one whose head is touching the ceiling.
Francois, my lord.
A Frenchman.
Hold.
Please.
We' re all gentlemen here.
He' s our interpreter, sir.
Forgive them.
I' m at war with the French, as well as the Scottish.
Have I forgotten anyone?
The Spaniards, am I at war with them?
Arnaut has sent many spies into my midst.
- No, he' s not a spy.
- No?
- He' s our friend.
- I' m sure he is.
He' s too tall to be a spy, anyway.
- lnterpret.
- Be quiet.
Interpret.
- I' m a spy.
- I' m sorry, I didn' t quite catch that.
- It means...
- Be quiet, Francois.
... I am a spy.
My God, it' s a miracle.
A quiet Frenchman.
- Did you hear that?
- No.
Louder, boy!
Come on!
I am a spy.
I thought so.
- Oh, my God!
- Get rid of the Frenchman.
Put them with the old man.
We may need them.
Who' s next?
- No!
- No, Chris!
Don' t!
Don' t!
Oh, Francois.
Francois.
Inside!
- Up!
Move it!
Move it!
Don' t push me!
- Hey, leave her alone!
- Move it, ease on!
- All right, you bloody Scottish!
- Hold on!
I' m moving!
Over here, Andre.
This way.
Come on.
My marker.
Guys, I lost my marker!
Don' t worry, we only need one marker to get home, OK?
- This can' t be happening.
- Careful with the rest.
Those bastards killed Francois.
Professor.
Professor!
- Kate?
- Yeah.
- Kate.
Oh, my God, Kate.
- Are you all right?
Oh, my God.
You got my message.
Chris, your dad.
- Chris is here and Marek' s here.
- Dad?
- Son.
- Dad.
- Chris, my son.
- Glad you' re still alive.
Oh, God.
What happened?
- You' ve lost such blood.
- It' s not my blood.
It' s Francois'.
He' s dead.
Oliver had him killed because he' s French.
This guy had a sword and he just ran him through.
Professor, what happened?
I was trying to avoid the English, but they found me in the monastery.
I convinced Oliver I was a magister on my way to Dublin.
I skipped Shakespeare.
What is a magister?
- It' s a scientist.
- He accused me of being a spy.
- How did you survive that?
- I promised Oliver a new weapon.
What kind of weapon?
A liquid fire so intense that even water couldn' t harm it.
Greek fire?
You promised him Greek fire?
Professor, I' m sorry, have you considered what you may have done?
You' ve given the English a serious advantage in this battle.
- They' re supposed to lose the war!
- I was alone!
- Marek, Marek!
- I' m sorry, I' m sorry.
You' re right.
The point is, when these guys come here, and take us up to La Roque, when they seal that place off for battle, there is no escape.
We' re as good as dead.
- No, we gotta get out of here now.
- Wait, wait, wait.
Remember that field where the peasant huts were?
That' s the closest place with enough room to use the marker.
- How do we get there?
- We have to do it fast.
- We' ve got four hours.
- Four hours is plenty.
The way I see it, we' ve got 650 years of knowledge on these guys.
There' s no reason why we shouldn' t be able to get home in 20 minutes.
- OK, let' s find a way out.
- Let' s look around.
There' s a hole here big enough to climb through.
- Quiet!
- OK, all right.
She was with the group we caught earlier, my lord.
May I ask why you' re trespassing on my land?
Come, come.
- What are you doing?
- Here' s what I' il do:
When it' s clear, I' m gonna let you guys out.
- All right.
- You' re not going anywhere.
What?
I am, I' m...
Marek, I' m the best climber.
I am the best climber.
If anyone should be going, it should be me, but those roof slats won' t hold me, or you, or you, Chris.
- No, no...
- Wait.
Wait.
But they might hold you, Kate.
Now, Kate, this isn' t a game.
Are you prepared to take a life?
I' il do what I have to do.
There' s no way.
You' re not going anywhere.
It' s going to be all right, OK?
There' s one thing worse than dying here, and that' s living here.
I refuse to do either.
I' m going.
It' s OK.
She' s right.
Kate.
- Please, please take care.
It' s gonna be easy.
Chris, I need your help.
Come on.
I need you to hold that back and keep it open.
All right?
- Kate, be careful.
- OK, here I go.
- Easy.
- There' s guards there.
I' m gonna go up and over.
- There' s a window on the side.
- OK, watch yourself.
I got you!
I got you!
Hold on!
Hold on.
I got you.
Don' t let go.
- Are you OK?
- I' ve got a foothold.
- We' re gonna pull you back in.
- No, I' m good.
- OK, please be careful.
- I' ve got to keep going.
You, man!
Gather those children and move!
All clear on the outside.
Hold your line, men!
In position!
Too much ale.
We' il play again when I get back.
Keep them quiet.
- What the...?
- Now!
Grab a weapon!
Chris!
- Very sorry.
We' re heading out the way we came in, all right?
Marek?
- Marek!
- Yeah, yeah.
You go ahead.
- I' il take the rear.
- All right, let' s go!
Kate, we gotta go.
Oh, be careful!
Let' s go!
Come on.
Let' s go!
Quiet.
You guys go ahead.
I' il catch up with you.
- What are you doing?
- Are you crazy?
- Let' s go.
- I got my marker, I' il catch up.
- Come on.
- Where is he?
- He' il catch up.
He' s got his marker.
- Robert!
- Yeah?
DNA streaming should be online... now.
- Got it!
- Fully functioning?
- Yeah!
- It' s a start.
Don' t say a word.
- Traitor!
Why didn' t you listen to me?
Shit!
For God' s...
Stop, it' s me!
Stop!
What?
What are you saying?
Ax!
Give me the ax!
And help me watch for the wall!
Move that stuff!
Put it against the door!
- Help me!
- Get out of the way, woman!
Get out of the way!
Come on!
There we go!
Go!
Guards!
- Who is that guy?
- His name is De Kere.
Come on.
Quick, let' s head back to the river.
Get more guards!
- We' re not going without Marek.
- I don' t give a shit about Marek.
My job was to get the professor.
I can' t take care of you.
I lost Gomez, Baretto.
Let' s go!
To the river, quick.
We have a field buck.
Somebody' s trying to come back.
- How strong?
- It' s minimal.
- What does that mean?
- It means they' re still alive.
Halt!
Come on.
Come on.
Where is he?
Where' s Gordon?
Where' s...?
- There he is.
There he is.
- I saw him.
Come on!
- Wait.
Watch it.
Drop your weapon.
OK.
Go.
Oh, shit.
- Come on!
- Gonna leave us like you left my dad?
- People are looking.
- There' s no time.
Listen.
- Everybody is looking.
- Be quiet.
- Kate, hit your marker.
Press yours.
I' m not going without Marek.
- Hit your marker.
- You' re not going anywhere.
Marek' s got his own marker.
Search every building and every farm!
- Oh, shit.
- Kate, press it.
We can come back for Marek.
We' ve been here too long.
- Press it.
- It' s not working.
- It' s not working.
- I know how to do this.
- Why isn' t it?
- I don' t know.
- Everybody, walk away slowly.
Let' s find a place to hide.
Infantry, spread out.
Search the huts!
Search everywhere and capture them!
Oh, by the way, my name' s Andre Marek.
Castlegard was your village, wasn' t it?
- Don' t worry, you' il return there soon.
- No.
The English will burn it to the ground before they move to La Roque.
- No, La Roque will fall too.
- Yes.
But it will take many more lives and many months of fighting before it happens.
The French built that fortress.
We know how strong it is.
La Roque will fall tonight.
Only a prophet... or a fool could make such a claim.
In your case, it' s probably the fool.
Whichever makes you smile like that.
Are you... married?
No.
We' ve been fighting the English since before I was born.
There' s no time for marriage.
Of course.
Are you with... anyone?
- Am I with anyone?
- Yeah.
I' m with you.
I know, I know.
What I mean is, is there someone...?
Is there someone that you see?
- Do I see?
- Yeah.
Nobody.
It is possible they are hiding on the shore or in the woods.
They could be anywhere.
Oh, God.
You know, it' s funny, but we' re speaking the same language, but you don' t understand anything I' m saying, do you?
Get them!
No, no.
It is good.
They are French.
They will help us.
- You' re Lady Claire.
- Lady?
I like that.
It' s charming.
Dame Claire.
Fire!
Fire!
Find them!
I killed that man.
I' ve gotta live with that.
- In here!
- We found them!
- We found them, my lord!
- Over here now!
- Come on!
- Don' t let them go!
Come on!
Go inside!
Go around the back.
- Shut up and move over there.
- Come on.
- Burn it.
- No.
- No, you can' t do that!
- Don' t.
Chris, please get out of there.
Chris!
Chris!
My son' s in there!
Chris, get out of there!
Hold your man.
No!
No!
All right, come on.
- Come on.
- Chris, wait up.
- Come on.
- Wait up.
- Claire!
- Arnaut.
He is very grateful you returned his sister...
- You' re English.
- No, I' m Scottish.
Arnaut, he saved the life of one of your men.
- You' re Scottish, huh?
- Yes.
In that case, I do not know how to express my gratitude.
Well, you can.
Just keep her close and keep her safe.
- I can take care of myself.
- Yes, that' s obvious.
Please, do not let her out of your sight, especially tonight.
Do not worry, she will be well protected.
I must leave.
I must return to Castlegard to search for my friends.
I need to ask you perhaps for a horse and a weapon.
You will not make it alive through the English lines.
They are moving from the village to La Roque.
We attack tonight.
- You must not go back there.
- I must try and find my friends.
I' m sorry.
Very well, I will give you what you ask for.
- Thank you again.
- Thank you.
- Lady Claire...
- Claire.
I wish we had met at another time.
Andre Marek.
Are you married?
No.
Arnaut?
Arnaut has dismounted, and he' s with his sister.
Well done.
In fast, kill Arnaut and out.
And may God be with you.
All right, I have to get inside La Roque and find my dad.
- You' il never make it through.
- I' il find a way.
There is no way.
You' il get killed.
Oh, Jesus.
Go, go.
- I don' t have a choice.
- Yes, you do.
There' s another way.
- What, the tunnel?
- Yeah.
You never found it.
You don' t know it exists.
- There' s always been a rumor.
- Yeah, but that' s a rumor.
- My dad' s life is on the line.
- All of our lives are on the line.
Look, if that tunnel ever existed, it' s going to exist now, 1357.
I know it' s in that monastery.
I know it.
I wanna save your father as much as you do.
You have to trust me.
I know it' s there.
I know it.
You' ve got to trust me.
Stay in line.
- Move along.
- Keep the pace!
Kill Arnaut!
Claire!
Claire!
Claire!
Move along!
Come on, lads.
That' s Marek!
Marek!
- Marek!
- I' m OK.
It' s Chris and Kate, Marek.
- What about Chris and Kate?
- They didn' t make it.
- They' ve killed them.
- What?
Been a while, hasn' t it, Frank?
Oh, my God.
I thought you were dead.
Right, that' s why you sent Taub to assassinate me.
Not to assassinate you, to bring you home.
- Right, just like you are.
Listen.
- Listen to me, Will.
I need your help.
- What' s this?
Look, it' s not working anyway.
It says here you got less than one and a half hours left.
- It doesn' t work.
- Bullshit.
Look, you' ve got to believe me, it wasn' t my fault, OK?
- I' ve got a family.
- Yeah?
- You' ve met my family.
- You got a family?
- You have a family.
- I' ve got a family.
- So did l!
- No!
- No!
- No!
No!
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, my God!
Last time I saw him, he was running with his marker for an open space.
I was on the ground, three arrows in me.
I used to be William Decker, lTC employee number 273.
Now...... I' m Sir William De Kere, Lord Oliver' s aide- de- camp.
You looked pretty impressive today, Marek, for an academic.
- How do you know my name?
- I know all of your names.
We read every report out of your dig before we made the first trip back.
How many times have you been here?
Enough to know transcription errors intimately.
Transcription errors?
Doniger, that son of a bitch.
He hasn' t told you a thing, has he?
What are transcription errors?
Mistakes in the DNA reconstruction process.
- It' s like faxing a fax.
- Distortions.
Mistakes.
Only the distortions aren' t in the letters.
It' s body parts.
The organs.
I' ve gone in too many times.
I' il never survive another trip.
All that damage, it can be repaired, but not here.
And not in this time.
You' d have to go back.
Why don' t you press the marker?
We can all go home, Decker, huh?
My name is De Kere.
This is my home.
Lord Oliver awaits his Greek fire.
After that, your survival depends on your knowledge of history.
I rise in favor, so do you.
I fall, you fall.
Marek, where' s your marker?
De Kere, Decker, whatever his name is, he took it off me.
Oh, God.
We' re friends of Edward De Johnness.
- Edward De Johnness.
- The magister.
He' s my father.
- The Englishmen have harmed him?
- We don' t know.
- We were gonna ask for your help.
- Yeah, we need your help.
Come.
We need to hurry.
We don' t have much time.
Lord Oliver demands a demonstration before nightfall.
It would be best not to miss the deadline.
They' ve done it.
The stuff' s all there.
This stuff' s a bit coarse, but it' s good.
What am I talking about?
I can' t do this.
I can' t give them Greek fire and influence the course of history.
- I may already have done that.
- What do you mean?
When we first arrived here, we were helped by this girl who took us up to Castlegard.
In fact, that' s who I went back to get when we escaped.
That girl turned out to be Lady Claire, Arnaut' s sister.
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.
I' ve delivered her to the French for safekeeping.
She' s incredibly important.
Her death rallies the French to win.
- Don' t you understand?
- Keep it down, OK?
Now we have to be on Oliver' s side just to stay alive.
This is exactly where I was digging.
This is it.
This is the place where...
We' re here.
We' re...
What do you mean?
This is the chamber where I was working.
- I' m sorry, what did he say?
- The army of Arnaut is ready to attack.
- We' re running out of time.
- Those are the stairs.
It' s under here.
Move them up here.
There' s a goodly number of trebuchets, my lord.
What' s a little fire to these stone walls?
- There' s nothing down here.
- This is it.
This is the chamber.
This is where the hole was.
- We came down here...
- There' s nothing here.
Marek would' ve been working there.
The box would' ve been...
Oh, my God.
That is the box.
That' s the parchment he wrote on.
My father' s glasses.
- Yeah, we' ve got to go.
- No, no, put it back.
If we don' t find this, in the future we' re never gonna find your father.
Put it back.
We still gotta go.
We gotta get up to La Roque.
No, the stone relief was damaged.
Somebody had damaged it.
"What kind of son of a bitch would damage something so..."
It was me.
It was me.
I was the son of a...
What is she doing?
Wait!
Get back!
Stay back!
Watch out.
Watch out.
Oh, wow.
It' s the tunnel.
It' s the tunnel!
Give me a torch.
Hey, give me that one.
Let me go in.
- Get Arnaut?
- Yes, get Arnaut.
- Please, hurry.
Hurry.
- Kate, get in here.
- Oh, whoa.
- You got it?
Yeah, I do.
Careful, boys, this is Greek fire.
You can blow us all to hell here.
Smooth and easy, now.
No spills.
That' s good.
- Trebuchet!
- Trebuchet!
Shit.
- You OK?
- Yeah.
Hurry, there' s no time.
- Trebuchet!
Trebuchet!
Bring water!
Lord Oliver, the magister with your demonstration.
Oh, yes, I' il see it now.
- Understand, my lord, I' ve never...
- Show me now!
- Show him!
- Your fire of the Greeks.
- Marek, fire it!
- OK, come on, let' s move it.
Trebuchet!
Just fire the damn thing!
I cannot fire it.
Fire it!
- Fire!
- Ready, fire!
Out of the way.
Let me pass.
That' s it?
So you betrayed me.
You promised me Greek fire.
I should have had you hung...
- What?
- With your permission, my lord.
The more water, the more fire.
Good.
Better.
My God, you are a magician, not a magister.
I want this for every cannon.
How many men will you need?
- Twenty.
- Twenty.
- Give this man 20 men.
- As you wish.
This way, magician.
Archers to the battlements!
- Archers to the battlements!
- Archers to the battlements!
It' s over.
I' m not gonna play with their lives like this.
We can' t get 100% efficiency from patched- together coils.
What' s the safest minimum percent?
- You just said we have 81%.
- They were inanimate objects.
- With reflectors up.
- How much time do we have?
- 28 minutes.
No room for error.
- They could be deformed.
- Yes, we can.
- It' s too risky.
You think I' m gonna let you leave them?
- Think I want to?
- I don' t think you care.
They have a chance, some kind of life.
No, you lost the chance for that decision a long time ago.
- This is no longer your decision.
- You know what?
It is and I have.
I' m sorry.
- Fire the moat.
- Yes, my lord.
Fire the moat!
- Light your arrows.
- Light arrows.
- Archers, prepare.
- Archers, prepare.
- Stretch.
- Stretch.
Away!
- Night arrows.
- Night arrows.
A little surprise for the French.
- Ready!
- Stretch.
Away!
We' re close now.
We' re close, I know it.
Great.
Well done, my lord.
Trebuchet!
One more of them, and we become history.
Oh, no.
No.
We' re going.
Forward, right maybe.
Maybe it' s just...
Or we could go up, right?
We could go up.
- Kate...
- No, don' t.
No!
No!
- Kate.
- No.
Kate.
Maybe we missed something.
Maybe we made a wrong turn.
- We could...
- It' s too late.
It' s just too late.
I said trust me, and I' ve let you down.
And I' ve let your father down.
And...
- I' ve let everybody down.
- No.
- Oh, God, I' m so sorry.
- No, you didn' t.
Kate, come here.
Kate, come here.
Come here.
Come here.
- Close the inner gates!
- Close the inner gates!
- This is growing tiresome.
- The courtyard is secure, my lord.
Good, but this Frenchman needs to be put in his place.
- It' s time.
- Captain!
It is time!
Robert.
Thirteen minutes left.
Let' s try and get them back.
Are we gonna go over all this again?
What are you doing?
What the hell do you think I' m doing?
I' m protecting our interests.
- What' s happened to you?
- How many lives are lost on the cutting edge of discovery?
- It' s the price for great advances.
- These were kids, not astronauts!
- I know!
- They had no idea!
Even worse when they' re deformed!
You know the media.
They' il twist it around and label it a "death machine".
- It has a serious flaw!
- And you' il fix it.
- No, I won' t.
- Like you fixed everything else.
- No.
- What?
- You won' t?
- No, I won' t.
I can' t believe you' d just throw away your place in history.
- I already have, we' re cycling up.
- Think you can go behind my back?
Huh?
Kramer!
Kramer?
- Make the prisoner ready.
- What is your will, my lord?
- Back to work.
- Secure her to the battlements.
I want to be sure the French can see her.
At once, my lord.
- I' il give your brother a choice.
- Oh, shit.
- You are to be tied to the battlements.
- What?
Either he lays down his arms or he kills you with his own weapons.
Let us hope a man who stoops to using his own sister as a spy still has some sense of decency left.
God be with you, lady.
It' s her.
It' s Lady Claire.
I delivered her to Arnaut for safekeeping.
- How did the English get her?
- It' s history.
Then history will change.
Oliver.
Release Lady Claire and bring her down to me now, or by God, I will destroy your arsenal.
No!
- Get the hell out of here.
Halt!
For God' s sake.
If that thing blows, it' il kill us all.
- Bring her down.
- No!
Do not touch her!
My lord, if he drops the torch, he then kills her too.
He will not do it.
Back off, De Kere.
Or Decker, or whatever your name is.
I will blow your arsenal to hell!
- There' s no way out.
- You' re English.
- No.
No, no, we' re not.
- You' re English!
This is a trap!
- Run, my lord!
- Marek!
- You are working for Oliver.
- No, we' re not.
I will kill both of you!
Down!
- Yeah!
- Yahoo!
Be careful, my lord.
Archers, to the battlements!
Here.
- Hold the line on the east tower.
- Oliver!
Kill her!
Now!
- Arnaut!
- Claire!
We' ve got to find the others.
Don' t!
Hold your line!
- Dad.
- Chris, you' re alive!
Kate, thank God!
- Where' s Marek?
- I don' t know.
There goes Marek.
There' s Marek.
It' s OK.
It' s OK, Claire.
It' s me.
It' s me.
It' s me.
It' s me.
It' s me.
- What are you doing?
- Open the gate.
Chris, stop!
- It' s solid.
I' ve gotta get up.
- Can you?
- Yeah.
This is for France.
- We gotta get out of here.
- Where' s Marek?
- I don' t know.
- He went after Lady Claire.
There.
No!
My ear!
My ear!
It' s me.
It' s me.
- It' s not working.
- Well, it' s broken.
- OK.
- I gotta get Marek.
De Kere took his.
- You guys run to the field.
- Not without you.
Kate!
Run to the center of the field and wait for us.
I' il get the other marker.
- Dad, go with her.
- Be careful.
Over here.
Marek!
I thought you were dead.
Your marker!
Let' s go!
De Kere!
De Kere has yours.
Stern!
Open this door.
Where' s Kramer?
Where' s Kramer?
Shit!
Take me home.
Please.
Go!
- It' s working.
Be careful.
- Come on, let' s go.
- Marek, come on.
- Get out of here!
We got less than a minute!
Let' s go home, come on!
Come on, let' s go!
Let' s go, man!
Come on, they' re waiting!
- Go.
Get the hell out of here.
- No, let' s go home!
I am home, Chris.
Chris, just go.
Say goodbye for me.
I' m gonna miss you, Marek.
If you can do it, then do it.
One more minute.
Eighty- one percent, OK?
- What' s he doing?
- The coils.
- Come on!
- This is good here.
- Wait!
- There he is.
- Wait!
- Come on!
Where' s Marek?
- He' s staying.
He' s staying.
- Let' s go.
- Push the marker.
- I am.
I' m getting a field buck!
Someone' s coming back!
What?
No!
- No!
- You gotta...
I don' t have a marker.
I' il never get home.
Where' s Marek?
And Francois?
- Hey, Dad.
- Yeah?
Kate just called from the monastery dig.
She finished excavating the sarcophagus and wants us there.
- Wanna drive?
- Yeah, I' il drive.
Look what I uncovered.
If Marek had come home with us, what would be written here?
Oh, my God.
"Andre Marek.
"With his beloved wife, Claire."
Oh, my God.
"... and Francois." Dear Francois.
"To my friends who survive me,
"I have chosen a wonderful life.
"Died 1382."
Born 1971.
They made their own history.
Together.
It' s an important and popular fact that things are not always what they seem.
For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was the most intelligent species occupying the planet, instead of the third most intelligent.
The second most intelligent creatures were dolphins, who, curiously enough, had long known of the impending destruction of the planet Earth.
They' d made many attempts to alert mankind, but most of their communications were misinterpreted as amusing attempts to punch footballs or whistle for tidbits.
So they eventually decided they would leave Earth by their own means.
The last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a sophisticated attempt to do a backward somersault through a hoop, whistling The Star- Spangled Banner.
In fact, the message was this:
- "So long and thanks for all the fish."
[male chorus]
(So long and thanks for all the fish) (So sad that it should come to this) (We tried to warn you all but, oh, dear) (You may not share our intellect) (Which might explain your disrespect) (For all the natural wonders that grow around you) (So long, so long and thanks... for all the fish)
[female chorus]
(Your world' s about to be destroyed) (There' s no point getting all annoyed) (Lie back and let the planet dissolve around you) [male chorus]
(Despite those nets of tuna fleets) (We thought that most of you were sweet) (Especially tiny tots and your pregnant women) (So long, so long, so long, so long, so long) [female chorus]
(So long, so long) [whole chorus]
(So long, so long and thanks for all the fish)
[girl solo]
(If I had just one last wish) (I would like a tasty fish) [woman solo]
(If we could just change one thing) (We would all have learnt to sing) [full chorus]
(Come one and all) (Man and mammal) (Side by side) (In life' s great gene pool!)
(So long, so long, so long) [female chorus]
(So long, so long) [whole chorus]
(So long, so long and thanks for all the fish!)
The extraordinary story of The Hitchhiker' s Guide to the Galaxy begins very simply.
It begins with a man.
An Earthman, to be precise.
Who no more knows his destiny, than a tea leaf knows the history of the East India Company.
His name is Arthur Dent.
He is a five- foot- eight- inch- tall ape descendant and someone is trying to drive a bypass through his house.
What do I want you to do about it?
Find him and tell him I' m currently lying flat on my back in front of...
Fine, I' il hold.
You can' t lie in front of the bulldozers for ever.
I' m game.
We' il see who rusts first.
This bypass has got to be built and it is going to be built.
- Why has it got to be built?
- It' s a bypass.
You' ve got to build bypasses.
Besides, you should' ve protested months ago.
The plans have been on display at the planning office for a year.
On display?
I had to go down to a cellar.
Mr Dent, have you any idea how much damage this bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight over you?
- How much?
- None at all.
By a strange coincidence, none at all is exactly how much suspicion ape- descendant Arthur had that one of his closest friends was not descended from an ape, but was, in fact, from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse.
Arthur!
Arthur!
- [Arthur]
- Yes?
Here.
Ah, there you are!
Eat, drink.
We gotta talk.
Now' s not the best time.
They' re going to demolish my home.
You already know?
How?
What do you m...?
Oh, they, they?
When you say "they" you mean they?
Got it.
Right now.
Well, what about my house?
[Ford]
Workers of the Earth, I bring good tidings of peanuts and beer!
- Huh?
They won' t demolish it until they' ve finished the beers.
- Can we trust 'em?
- To the end of the Earth.
- How far' s that?
- About 1 2 minutes away.
Huh?
The world' s about to end.
Barman, six pints of bitter and quickly.
The world' s about to end.
Six pints coming up.
Keep the change.
You got about ten minutes to spend it.
Three pints each?
At lunchtime?
Ah.
Time is an illusion.
Lunchtime, doubly so.
And eat those peanuts, because you' il need the salt.
- Look, what is going on, Ford?
- Arthur...
What if I told you I really wasn' t from Guildford?
I was from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse?
Is that something you' re likely to say?
Remember when we met?
Out the way!
- Hi.
Wasn' t it strange I was trying to shake hands with a car?
I assumed you were drunk.
I was introducing myself.
Please drink.
It must be Thursday.
I could never get the hang of Thursdays.
- If this is about your house...
- No, it' s not about the house.
Who' s he?
- [Arthur]
She.
Tricia McMillan.
We met at a fancy- dress party.
I hate those kind of parties.
I' d rather have stayed at home and ironed my hankies.
- But there I was.
Who are you?
- And there she was.
- Uh, Dent.
Arthur Dent.
I mean, who are you?
Oh, the costume?
Right.
"Livingstone, I presume!"
Yeah, it' s not as clever as Darwin, but the best I could do at short notice.
You' re the first to get that right.
- [Arthur]
Everyone calls me Santa.
- I thought the beagle was a giveaway.
So did l.
People at these parties are drunken idiots.
- [music stops]
God!
That' s awkward.
Tell me.
She was amazing though, Ford.
Beautiful, witty, mad as a balloon.
Uh, without the beard, you look at least 80 years younger.
Maybe I' m de- evolving.
Well, I should tell you that I do not date single- celled organisms, okay?
Let' s go somewhere.
Um, where do you have in mind?
- Madagascar.
- Is that that new club on Dean Street?
No, it' s a country off the coast of Africa.
That Madagascar?
Why are we waiting here?
- [Tricia laughs]
Go.
God, you' re serious.
Um, I can' t go to Madagascar.
- [Arthur]
Because, I just, you know...
- You' re serious?
- Yeah.
I want to go somewhere I' ve never been and I' d like to go with you, so...... what do you say, Dr Livingstone?
I say that' s an extraordinary proposition.
I can' t go.
I mean, I' ve got a job.
Quit.
Get a new one when you come back.
Ow!
- Well, Tricia McMillan.
Um, I have a proposition for you.
Why don' t we go somewhere a little closer first, say Cornwall, and we' il see how it goes.
Right, of course, Cornwall.
Hey, excuse me.
Is this guy boring you?
Why don' t you talk to me instead?
I' m from a different planet.
It' s true.
You want to see my spaceship?
"Do you want to see my spaceship?"
What kind of chat- up line is that?
Mm, that does happen.
- [electronic bleeps]
We' ve got two minutes.
Drink up.
- That' s my house.
People of Earth, a round of drinks, for everyone, on me.
You really think the world' s going to end?
Yes.
Shouldn' t we lie down, or put a paper bag over our heads, or something?
- If you like.
- Will it help?
See you.
Last orders!
What is that?
Run!
Look out!
Aha!
Towel!
Arthur!
What the hell are those things?
They' re ships from a Vogon constructor fleet.
I picked up their signal this morning.
You' il need this.
What are you doing?
- We' re hitching a ride.
Um, people of Earth, this is Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace Planning Council.
As you are probably aware, plans for the development of the outlying regions of the galaxy involve the building of a hyperspace express route through your star system.
And your planet is one of those scheduled for demolition.
There' s no point acting surprised about it.
The plans have been on display at your local planning office in Alpha Centauri for 50 Earth years.
If you can' t be bothered with local affairs, that' s your lookout.
Apathetic bloody planet.
I' ve no sympathy at all.
The Hitchhiker' s Guide to the Galaxy is a wholly remarkable book.
Perhaps the most remarkable, certainly the most successful, ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor.
More popular than The Celestial Homecare Omnibus, better selling than 53 More Things to Do in Zero Gravity, and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid' s trilogy of philosophical blockbusters, Where God Went Wrong,
Some More of God' s Greatest Mistakes, and Who Is This God Person Anyway?
It' s already supplanted the Encyclopedia Galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom for two important reasons.
First, it' s slightly cheaper, and second, it has the words "Don' t Panic" printed in large, friendly letters on its cover.
So you 're not from Guildford?
Which would explain the accent, which I' ve always wondered about.
Um, you' re not an out- of- work actor, but rather a writer for this, this book thing.
Good, huh?
I don' t feel well.
I need a cup of tea.
If I asked where we were, would I regret it?
We' re safe for now.
Good.
We' re in the washroom on one of the ships of the Vogon constructor fleet.
- Oh, get me home, Ford.
- Arthur, your home is...
Oh, God, my home.
My home was demolished.
You don' t remember.
Okay, Arthur, I' ve got something to tell you.
It' s unfortunate, but it' s true.
Your home planet has been blown up.
- [Ford grunts]
Couldn' t you have done something?
Okay, that makes us even.
It' s a tough galaxy.
If you want to survive out here, you' ve...... gotta know where your towel is.
Okay, give me a hand over here.
It' s hot.
We' ve gotta get off this ship.
Before the Vogons find us.
Vogons, they hate hitchhikers.
Pull.
- [steam hisses]
- Now we' il get a signal.
- What is a Vogon?
Say "Vogons".
- Vogons.
Vogons are one of the most unpleasant races in the galaxy.
Not evil, but bad- tempered, bureaucratic, officious and callous.
Iost again and finally buried in soft peat for three months and recycled as firelighters.
On no account should you allow a Vogon to read poetry to you.
They can' t think or imagine.
Most can' t spell.
They just run things.
Hmm?
And if we don' t get a ride soon, we won' t need the Guide to tell us how unpleasant the Vogons are.
They' ve already destroyed a planet today.
That always makes them a little eee!
What is that?
- Put this in your ear.
- Huh?
We have unwittingly picked up a couple of hitchhikers.
The fish is translating for you.
The Babel fish is small, yellow, leech- like, and probably the oddest thing in the universe.
It feeds on brainwave energy, absorbing unconscious frequencies, and excreting a matrix of conscious frequencies to the speech centers of the brain.
The practical upshot of which is that, if you stick one in your ear, you instantly understand anything said to you in any language.
Resistance is useless.
- [Arthur]
Someone' s coming.
[Vogon # 2]
Look lively.
- [Vogon minion]
- [Vogon Jeltz]
Hitchhikers.
"O freddled gruntbuggly..."
No, really, you don' t have to read.
We' ve put you through enough trouble already. "... as plerdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee."
Vogon poetry is widely accepted as the third worst in the universe.
The second worst is that of the Azgoths of Kria.
"Or I will rend thee in the gobberwarts..."
The absolute worst poetry was by Paula Millstone Jennings of Sussex.
"See if I don' t." Yeah.
So, Earthlings, I present you with a choice.
Either die in the vacuum of space, or tell me what you thought of my poem.
A... a... actually, I rather liked it.
- [Ford]
Yeah.
- That' s good.
- Hmmm.
Uh, some of the words I didn' t understand, but I found the imagery quite effective.
Continue.
Well, uh, yes, interesting rhythmic devices, which seemed to counterpoint the underlying metaphor of the humanity of...
- Vogonity!
- Vogonity, sorry, vogonity... of the poet' s soul.
I just want to be loved?
Yes, yes, yes.
Throw them off the ship!
- [Ford]
No!
- Ford.
Ford!
All right!
All right!
Resistance is useless!
Shut up!
Get a job!
Wash your filthy hands!
Don' t panic.
Don' t panic.
So this is it?
We' re going to die?
Yeah, we' re gonna die.
No, no, what' s this?
What is this?
What' s this?
This is... nothing.
Yeah, we' re gonna die.
You' re sweating.
Would you like a hug?
No.
"is big.
Really big. "
"You just won' t believe how vastly, hugely, mind- bogglingly big it is."
A... a... and so on.
It also says that if you hold a lungful of air, you can survive in the total vacuum of space for about 30 seconds.
But with space being really big and all, the chances of being picked up within that time are two to the power of two billion, 79 million, 460 thousand, 347 to one against.
By a staggering coincidence, it' s also the phone number of the Islington flat, where Arthur went to a fancy dress party and met a very nice young woman whom he totally blew it with.
Though the planet Earth, the Islington flat and telephone have all now been demolished, Ford and Arthur were, in fact, rescued.
Ford?
Y es.
I think I' m a sofa.
I know how you feel.
So much for the laws of physics.
And our top story.
The sensational theft of the most coveted ship in the universe, the starship Heart of Gold.
Stolen at the launch ceremony by none other than Galactic President Zaphod Beeblebrox.
I hereby kidnap myself and I' m taking the ship with me.
- [crowd gasps]
Beeblebrox, universally considered to be the dimmest star in several solar systems, is most famous for his controversial defeat of Humma Kavula who claimed many thought they were voting for the worst- dressed being in the universe contest.
Great.
"Don' t Vote for Stupid!" campaign.
Put your ego aside.
Something important has happened.
If there' s anything more important than my ego, I want it caught and shot now.
Come on, I love it.
Zaphod' s just this guy, you know.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
What d' you...?
- I was just watching myself.
- We have a couple of hitchhikers.
Hitchhikers?
Why' d you pick up hitchhikers?
I didn' t.
The ship did.
[Zaphod]
Say what?
When we engaged the improbability Drive...
The big button.
I know.
- They were picked up here.
In sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha.
Wait.
That' s where you picked me up.
- On Earth.
- That' s impossible.
- No, just very improbable.
I don' t have time for this.
We' ve got the police of half the galaxy after us.
We' ve stopped for hitchhikers.
So ten out of ten for style, but...... minus several million for good thinking.
You drive me crazy.
I' il send Marvin.
- [whirring]
You ought to know, I' m feeling very depressed.
Well, we have something that should take your mind off things.
It won' t work.
I have an exceptionally large mind.
Yeah, we know.
But we need you to go down to the number two entry bay and pick up our stowaways and bring them up here.
[Marvin]
I won' t enjoy it.
Yeah, well, that' s life.
[Marvin]
Don' t talk to me about life.
Commander Kwaltz.
Yes.
We have located the spaceship Heart of Gold and President Beeblebrox.
- Where?
- Sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha.
Requesting hyperspace clearance.
Hold your position, captain, until clearance is granted.
- Yes, sir.
- Get me Vice- President Questular.
Hyperspace permission granted, captain.
Here we go.
I think that door just sighed.
Ghastly, isn' t it?
All the doors have been programmed to have a cheerful and sunny disposition.
Anyway, come on.
I' ve been ordered to take you up to the bridge.
Please yourselves.
Here I am, brain the size of a planet, and they ask me to take you up to the bridge.
Call that job satisfaction?
'Cause I don' t.
You can thank the Sirius Cybernetics Corp. for building robots with G. P. P.
What' s G. P. P.?
Genuine People Personalities.
I' m a personality prototype.
You can tell, can' t you?
Arthur?
Hey, Slim, are you wearing my underwear?
And they ain' t doing the trick.
Come on.
All right.
Oh, for heaven' s sake.
I' ve brought the aliens.
Don' t thank me or anything.
- [Ford squeals]
[Marvin]
Not a refrigerator.
- I wasn' t talking to you, Giggles.
Oh, why do I bother?
- Zaphod?
- Ford!
[Zaphod]
Is that you?
Praxibetel lx!
What the hell are you doing here?
I just stuck out my thumb and here I am.
That is so you.
Look at you!
President of the Galaxy.
I can' t believe you beat Humma Kavula.
You zarkin 'frood.
I want you to meet a friend.
Arthur, this is Zaphod Beeblebrox.
President of the Galaxy.
This is my cousin.
He' s a semi- half brother...
- We share three of the same mothers.
- We' ve met.
[laughs]
I' ve got a terrible memory for species.
This is him, Ford.
The would- you- like - to- see- my- spaceship bloke.
- Yeah.
- Hello, Arthur.
- Tricia!
- How you doin '?
- Hey, Trillian.
This is my semi- half- brother lx, I' m sorry, Ford.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Um, would you excuse us for a second, please?
You went down on that little planet and didn' t call me?
Sorry, I didn' t know.
I had a galaxy to run.
Hi, Tricia McMillan, right?
I think he called you Trillian.
Which of us got the right one?
I shortened it.
Something a little more spacey.
I don' t know, Arthoolia.
[laughs]
Well, this is weird.
- How' d you get here?
- I just stuck out my thumb.
- Right.
In your pajamas?
- I was in a hurry.
Okay.
Did you know I was here?
Don' t flatter yourself.
I' ve got a spaceman too.
Yeah, that' s kinda like the Dingo Shuffle, yeah.
Okay, um, look.
I left you at the party.
I feel bad, but I was gonna call you when I got back.
Well, there is no going back now, is there?
You do know what happened?
Enough small talk.
We' re on the run, remember?
Excuse me, we' re having a chat.
Well, I think the girl' s getting...
Boo!
You blew it with her, Earthman, so shut your face or I' il kick you in the zatch.
- You wanna fight?
- Okay.
- No.
No.
- I' m just kidding.
I' m a kidder.
Let' s be friends.
Let' s connect.
You and l.
Didn' t see that one coming, did you?
Popped right out of the box.
You foxy, yeah!
He' s a guest on my ship.
He' s a guest on my ship!
I thought you said you stole it.
Stole what?
What are we talking about?
That doesn' t sound good.
- Are you okay?
- Just fabulous, thanks, "Trill".
A little help over here.
I' m in over my head.
I' il take care of this.
Good Zarquon, do I have to do everyhing?
Yes, I do!
Hey, this is really pretty.
- Whoo!
They' re on our tail.
Fire a gun.
Launch a missile.
Do some damage!
Ow!
Stop that!
Ow!
Just kiddin '.
I love it rough.
Hit me.
- Uh, computer?
Hi, there.
I' m Eddie, your computer.
I' m pleased to report that it' s a fleet of 100 Vogon battle destroyers.
They' re sending you a message.
This is Vice- President Questular Rontok.
I am speaking to the kidnapper of the President?
She digs me.
Surrender the stolen vessel at once or we will take action as defined and permitted by... section 1- 8 of the Galactic Interstellar Space Bylaws...
Zaphod, please come back now.
This is ridiculous.
Leap to hyperspace!
Come on!
Sure thing, fella!
No.
Did they have proper hyperspace authorization?
- Oh.
Bring me the request to pursue fugitive forms.
- [footsteps]
[panting]
Here' s the form, sir.
So are you along for the ride or am I just dropping you somewhere?
That depends.
Where are you going?
Where am I going?
- You okay?
Don' t suppose there' s any tea.
Come on.
I' il show you the kitchen.
When you see what I' m about to show you, you' il beg me to take you with us.
The best drink in existence is the Pan- Galactic Gargle Blaster, the effect of which is like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick.
- Belgium.
Hold it one second.
- Belgium.
Ape- man, Earth dude, sorry, what' s your name again?
- [coughs]
Gorgeous.
No hard feelings, okay?
Sorry to hear about your planet...
- Earth.
I liked Earth.
Got these boots there.
But don' t mention it to the girl.
I' il pull your spleen out through your throat.
- All right.
Thanks, buddy.
- Okay.
Good stuff.
Like those jammies.
Hey, hey, Zaphod, what' s with the two- head thing?
Apparently, you can' t be president with a whole brain.
It' s crazy.
- Oh, so you carved it up?
- Yes.
Parts of my personality weren' t exactly what you' d call presidential.
You know what I' m talkin 'about.
Your tea is ready.
[laughs]
I mean, if I' d had two heads, or three...
Or your own spaceship.
Anything else he' s got two of?
Come on, Arthur, don' t be like that.
What am I supposed to be like?
Bleeping?
I can fold my eyelids inside out if you like.
Okay, look.
Do you see this?
This detects what you' re craving and makes it for you.
Enjoy your doughnut.
- [buzzing]
This toasts bread while you' re slicing it.
We' re on a spaceship, Arthur.
In space.
- I told you I wanted to get away.
- To Madagascar.
That was... some sort of test.
And I failed.
- How badly does it hurt?
- It doesn' t feel great.
No, I mean your chin.
- Ah...
- I might have an aspirin.
Right.
- Hey!
Trillian, sorry.
There' s something I have to tell you.
- Please, don' t.
Showtime, Trill.
I' m going to set up.
Buttons aren' t toys.
Buttons aren' t toys.
When I saw what I' m about to show you, that' s when I realized why I had to do what I did to my brain.
I think.
It' s all a little...... shaky.
[electronic whirring]
It' s rubbish.
Many millions of years ago, a race of hyperintelligent, pan- dimensional beings got so fed up with the constant bickering about the meaning of life, that they commissioned two of their brightest and best to design and build a stupendous super- computer to calculate the answer to life, the universe and everything.
O Deep Thought, we want you to tell us the answer.
The answer to what?
The answer to life, the universe, everyhing.
We' d really like an answer.
Something simple.
Hmm, I' d have to think about that.
Return to this place in exactly seven- and- a- half million years.
- [Ford]
- No, there' s more.
They go back.
- Seven- and- a- half million years later?
- That' s right, they do.
Deep Thought, do you have...
An answer for you?
Yes, but you' re not going to like it.
- It doesn' t matter.
We must know it.
- All right.
... of life, the universe and everything... [cheering]
... 42.
[man]
What?
42?
Yes, I thought it over quite thoroughly.
It' s 42.
It would' ve been simpler to have known what the question was.
But it was the question.
The ultimate question.
Of everyhing!
That' s not a question.
Only when you know the question will you know what the answer means.
- Give us the ultimate question then.
- I can' t.
But there is one who can.
A computer that will calculate the ultimate question.
A computer of such infinite complexity, that life itself will form part of its operational matrix.
And you yourselves shall take on new, more primitive forms, and go down into the computer to navigate its 10- million- year program.
I shall design this computer for you, and it shall be called...
- That' s it?
- That' s it.
You' re looking for the ultimate question?
Why?
[Zaphod]
Why?
42.
Doesn' t work.
- Let' s get it ready, baby.
- Why...... do you want to know the ultimate question?
Partly curiosity, partly a sense of adventure, but, uh, mostly I think it' s for the fame and the money.
You' re President of the Galaxy.
- [Zaphod]
- Arthur.
Whatever.
Presidential fame is temporary.
I find the question, that' s permanent.
It sticks.
Plus, everyone thinks you' re deep.
Win- win.
We just hit that button and bam, we' re at Magrathea, I think.
We' ve hit it twice and we' re still not there, but anyway...
- You in?
- Always.
All right!
Uh, I want to get off.
- Uh, sorry, what exactly are we doing?
- This!
The Infinite Improbability Drive is a wonderful new method of crossing interstellar distances in a few seconds, without all that tedious mucking about in hyperspace.
As the Improbability Drive reaches infinite improbability, it passes through every conceivable point in every conceivable universe almost simultaneously.
So you' re never sure where you' il end up or even what species you' il be when you get there.
It' s therefore important to dress accordingly.
Ieap one foot to the left in accordance with the theory of indeterminacy.
Many physicists said they wouldn' t stand for that sort of thing, partly because it debased science, but mostly because they didn' t get invited to those sort of parties.
Wow, is this gonna happen every time we hit that button?
Very probably, yes.
Ah, I think the Earthman' s about to be sick.
In the trashcan, ape- man.
This ship' s new.
Aw, come on!
We have normality.
Did it work?
Are we there?
Yeah.
We' re here.
Magrathea!
I don' t think so.
Eddie...
- What planet is this?
I' m checking for you.
Did you just pluck one of my hairs?
Off my head?
[Eddie]
Sorry to disappoint, but this is not Magrathea.
We are currently in orbit around the planet Viltvodle Six.
- Humma Kavula!
Magrathea' s gonna have to wait.
I got a score to settle on this planet.
Humma Kavula!
In the beginning, the universe was created.
This made a lot of people very angry, and is widely regarded as a bad move.
Many races believed it was created by some sort of god, though the Jatravartid people of Viltvodle Six firmly believe that the entire universe was sneezed out of the nose of a being called the Great Green Arkleseizure.
Humma Kavula!
The Jatravartids, who lived in fear of the time they called the Coming of the Great White Handkerchief, were small blue creatures with more than 50 arms each.
They were unique in being the only race in history to have invented the aerosol deodorant before the wheel.
Mr President!
How you doin '?
Hey, what have we here?
I love it!
Hey, I love you.
Fantastic!
You guys related?
Don' t go changing.
Arthur, I want a drink.
I think I' ve been here before.
Have I been here before?
[women] lxxie!
- I' ve been here before.
Humma Kavula!
Come on.
Tricia!
Tricia, I...
(Now we await with eager expectation) (Thy handkerchief to bring us back to Thee)
Hello, Humma.
Join us.
Sit down.
- Good to see you.
Thanks.
All right.
The handkerchief is coming.
Let us pray the Almighty will exhale a breath of compassion on us all.
So that' s Humma Kavula.
I thought he was just swearing.
We lift our noses, clogged and unblown, in reverence to you.
Send the handkerchief, O Blessed One, so that it may wipe us clean.
We ask this and all things in Thy precious and alliterative name.
Bless you.
We goin 'in here?
All right, I like it.
It' s big, it' s gold, it' s fancy.
Fancy pants.
Zaphod Beeblebrox, our infamous President.
What brings you to our humble planet?
Oh, I think you know why I' m here.
No, I don' t think I do.
I think you think you don' t.
But we both know... you do.
Eloquent as always.
Your ability to articulate never ceases to amaze.
That' s funny.
During the campaign, Humma, when you were my opponent running against me, you said I was stupid.
The election is ancient history, Zaphod, but...... if memory serves, you won, proving that good looks and charm win over brilliance and the ability to govern.
And, incidentally, you are stupid.
[Arthur]
Excuse me, Mr Humma, sir.
'cause, actually, he' s not with us.
We came to worship you.
He followed us and...
He grew, didn' t he.
He' s not that tall.
You didn' t come half- way across the galaxy to settle a campaign grudge.
Why are you here?
Of course not, that' s, that' s ridiculous.
I' ve been stranded on a strange planet for years, I haven' t been avoiding you.
You look great.
You' re doing well.
You' ve grown, obviously.
- [Zaphod]
- Wait!
We were trying to get to Magrathea and our ship brought us here.
How very, very improbable.
I kept a few souvenirs from my former life.
Ah, the heady days of space piracy.
But... even an lnfinite improbability Drive requires coordinates.
Which I happen to have.
- No, no, no.
You don' t get something for nothing, Zaphod.
You must bring me something in return.
- [chuckles]
- [Humma]
- A very special gun.
Designed by the greatest computer ever invented.
But the only way to find it is to go to Magrathea.
Fine.
I' il get your gun.
Just give me the coordinates.
And what will you give me to ensure your return?
My word as President.
No.
I need a hostage.
Only... what does Zaphod Beeblebrox treasure?
- Come on.
Oh, no!
- [Zaphod]
- [electric saw]
No, stop it.
Oh, that kind of tickles.
Two heads are better than one.
Double your pleasure.
You need me!
Come back!
Come back!
Don' t leave me alone.
Come back!
I thought I alone considered your boyfriend a narcissistic moron, but the whole galaxy does.
What about you?
"Excuse me, Mr Humma, sir."
We just came to worship you. "Very brave.
- [whoosh]
[Vogon]
By the left, march.
Left, right, left, right.
Mr President, we' re here for your protection.
Fire upon the kidnapper!
Hey, come on!
The President is the kidnapper.
You' il kill him!
Bang!
Bang!
It' s locked!
I' il be in touch.
Come on, Zaphod.
- Hey, what did I miss?
- What have you been doing?
Field research.
So they found where we are?
Belgium bummer!
They' re shooting at us!
What are we going to do?
I have an idea.
- Pushing him out and running away?
[Arthur]
He' s the one they want.
You can' t go out there.
What are you doing?
- Back off!
What' s going on?
I have the President and I will kill him, I swear.
- Could that actually kill him?
- I don' t think so.
- Oh.
Okay, frightened now, frightened.
Hi, little guy.
- Get her!
Zaphod, no, come on!
Arthur!
- [Trillian]
- Tricia!
- Arthur!
- Tricia!
Wait!
I got shot.
I always felt like I' d be shot.
Somebody was trying to do me some harm because a lot of people don' t like me.
But I didn' t think it was gonna happen at that particular moment.
I' m surprised, but I' m happy.
I believe that, you know, this is all in God' s hands.
And I' m very appreciative to God for everything I' ve gotten to do.
"That guy died.
Oh, it' s so sad. "
Why is it sad?
He' s away from all of this bad stuff that' s here on Earth.
I mean, at the worst, he' s just somewhere quiet, no nothing.
At best, he' s an angel... or he' s a spirit somewhere.
What is so bad about that?
Throughout my life, I just wanted to be like an angel for God, do something where I could be of some help.
And I can do that.
I mean, I' m an artist.
It' s not like I have to tell the truth.
I have to tell a story and reach you and get some kind of feeling from you.
And then try to get the moral across.
So this is my story.
A story about ambition, violence, redemption and love.
In my life, I was different things for different people.
What' s up, nigga?
Some people say I was a thug and a gangsta.
Other people remember me as a poet and a born leader.
But I' m saying to you measure a man by his actions fully, through his whole life, from the beginning to the end.
Everybody' s past is what made their future.
It' s, like, about destiny.
My mother was a Black Panther, and she was really involved in the movement.
Power!
Power!
Power to the people!
Power to the people!
You know, just black people bettering themselves and things like that.
She had a high position in the Panther Party, which was unheard of, because there was sexism, even in the Panthers.
All of my roots to the struggle are real deep.
I was named after this Inca chief from South America whose name was Tupac Amaru.
And I think the tribal breakdown means, like, intelligent warrior, something like that.
He' s a deep dude.
If I go to South America, they' re gonna love me.
My stepfather at the time, Mutulu Shakur, he was also, like, a well- known revolutionary.
And then my godfather, Geronimo Pratt, had a top official rank position with the Panthers on the West Coast.
You can jail a revolutionary, but you can' t jail a revolution.
Harriet Tubman, they felt like they were laying tracks for a generation to come.
Come in, little brothers, sisters.
Y' all sit down and get something to eat.
There was always white people around helping out.
But still, you know, there' s racism.
So when the Panthers hit, the government panicked.
And they felt like the Panthers were detrimental to American society.
Remember, this country had a man named J. Edgar Hoover, whose job it was to destroy the credibility of any black man coming up.
- That' s what they did to the Panthers.
- Power to the people.
The government raided every Panther' s house, especially the ones who they felt like could do the most damage as an orator.
So they just burst in and put a gun to my mother' s head and said:
"Don' t move.
You' re under arrest. "
They treated her like less than human.
My mother was pregnant with me while she was in prison.
She was her own attorney, never been to law school.
She was facing 300 and something odd years.
One black woman, pregnant, beat the case.
That just goes to show you the strength of a black woman and the strength of the oppressed.
And a month after she got out of prison, she gave birth to me.
So I was cultivated in prison.
When I was a little baby, I remember that one moment of calm peace, and three minutes after that, it was on.
I rebelled against my mother because she was in the movement and we never spent time together.
She was speaking and going to colleges.
I used to feel like she cared more about the people than her people.
She was like, "You' re my son."
Then she was really close with me and really strict, almost.
My mother is totally brilliant, totally understanding and caring.
And she' s human.
I mean, she' il be wrong a lot, but we can talk about it.
She taught me how to be community- oriented, and to analyze society.
Me and my sister grew up good, and we have good minds and everything.
But we just didn' t have money.
Poverty is...
It' s no joke.
If there was no money and everything depended on your moral standards and the way you treated people, we' d be millionaires.
But, since it' s not like that, then we' re stone- broke.
I can' t always have what I want or things that I think I need.
Poverty, if I hated anything, it would be that.
You and me were born and raised in Harlem.
And every time you put it down, you' re not only putting us down, but Mama and Papa.
My real father was a Black Panther, but when I was growing up, I never knew who my father was for sure.
My stepfather was a gangster, a straight- up street hustler.
My mom had a kid, he didn' t even care.
He' s like, "That' s my son," took care of me, gave me money.
He was a criminal too, out doing his thing.
So he only came, brought me money and then left.
It' s OK to go to Harlem and celebrate your birthday with your friends, but I don' t think we would really fit in.
I hate saying this because whites love hearing blacks talk about this.
I' d have had some discipline, I' d have had more confidence.
Your mother cannot calm you down the way a man can.
Your mother can' t reassure you the way a man can.
My mother couldn' t show me where my manhood was.
You need a man to teach you how to be a man.
When I was young, I was quiet, withdrawn.
I read a lot.
I kept a diary.
I watched TV all the time.
I stayed in front of the television.
And I could see all these people out there in this pretend world.
And I knew I could be part of it if I pretended too.
I used to like the lifestyle, the way he used to live.
So early on, I just watched and emulated.
I could have some of their joy.
Oh, thank you, Mr. D!
If I could act like I had a big family, I wouldn' t feel as lonely.
My first acting job was at the Apollo Theater when Jesse Jackson was running for president in 1984.
It was a fundraiser, and I was a little kid.
Travis, from Raisin in the Sun.
I just caught that bug that everybody talks about.
I was like, "Whoa, this is it."
It was better than sex and anything, money, everything.
"I want this."
We moved out of New York because my mother lost her job.
We were, like, stranded.
So we moved to Baltimore...
... which was total ignorance town to me.
I mean, Baltimore has the highest rate of blacks killing blacks in the country.
Then I auditioned for the Baltimore School of Performing Arts.
Then I started to have good- luck times.
I spent three years in Baltimore, high- school years.
I made friends,
like Jon Cole and Jada Pinkett.
I loved my classes.
We were exposed to everything.
You know, theater, ballet...... listening to different types of music, songs that became a soundtrack to my life.
But in my homeboys' high school, it' s not like that.
They don' t have trips to go see this Broadway play, they don' t read things we read.
They didn' t know when I was like:
"Yo, Shakespeare' s dope." They don' t have the same experiences we had.
Then I started thinking the art school I went to was mostly for white kids and rich minorities.
I started going, "I would have been totally different
"had I not been exposed to this."
I was living in the ghetto.
We didn' t have lights and electricity.
- We was about to get evicted.
- We want home!
We want heat!
We want lights!
We want something to do for our children!
I thought, "We' re not being taught to deal with the world as it is."
The rich should live like the poor, the poor should live like the rich.
They should change every week.
The president stirred up a hornets' nest earlier this week when he suggested the problems of the hungry came about because they were uninformed about where to go for help.
How could Reagan live in a White House, which has a lot of rooms, and there be homelessness?
And he' s talking about helping.
I don' t believe that there is anyone that is going hungry in America simply by reason of denial or lack of ability to feed them.
It is by people not knowing where or how to get this help.
Why can' t he take people off the street and put them in his White House?
Then he' il have people from the streets to help him with his ideas.
Not helpless!
Homeless!
Not helpless!
They haven' t been homeless forever.
They' ve done things in society.
The White House would be tainted because he doesn' t want to get dirty.
Growing up in America, I loved my childhood, but I hated growing up poor.
We live in the gutter.
We live in a war zone.
We' ve got us stacked up 80- deep in one building.
When you get out your house, you' re strapped to protect yourself.
The same crime element that white people are scared of black people are scared of.
While they waiting for legislation to pass, we next door to the killer.
All them killers they let out, they' re in that building.
Just because we black, we get along with the killers?
What is that?
We need protection too.
Then I came to California to escape that violence.
Come to Marin City, and there' s even more poverty.
I was starting to see the one thing we have in common as black people, is we share that poverty.
I made it to where I had knowledge this wasn' t just me.
It was a bigger picture.
It was my people getting dogged.
It wasn' t just my family.
It was all of us.
Moving to Baltimore and Oakland and Marin and New York, and the poverty helped me to relate to everybody' s struggle.
Don' t get the wrong idea.
I feel like I' m being gloomy.
I don' t mean just to be like, "Damn it, it' s bad out there."
I still try to be positive.
I know that good things are gonna come for me.
- Where you go to school?
- Are you rolling?
- Yeah, rolling.
- Go ahead, that' s OK.
You dressed right for it.
He said he' s been a little chilly, so this is good for him.
- Somebody will enjoy the heat in here.
OK.
My name is Tupac Shakur, and I attend Tamalpais High School.
And I' m 17 years old.
Oh, my God, I got the phattest déjà vu.
I chased girls and bought the car and loud music, but I like to think of myself as really being socially aware.
I think there should be a class on drugs.
There should be a class on sex education, a real sex- education class.
There should be a class on police brutality.
There should be a class on apartheid.
There should be a class on why people are hungry.
But there are not.
There are classes on gym.
Let' s learn volleyball.
How do you think you' re most like your mom?
I' m most like my mom because I' m arrogant.
Totally arrogant.
You should see us when we get in our attitude moods.
We get in our tiffs and everything, but it' s good.
My mom' s my homey, but we went through our stages, where first we was mother and son, then it was like drill sergeant and cadet.
Then it was like dictator, little country.
Then I moved out, and I was on my own.
I was broke, nowhere to stay.
I smoked weed.
I hung out with the drug dealers, pimps and the criminals.
They were the only people that cared about me.
And I needed a father.
I needed a male influence, and these were the males.
You could see where I spent time in the streets when you talk to me.
The words I say don' t come from a mother' s or father' s mouth.
They come from a pimp' s mouth or a prostitute or a hustler or drug dealer.
To me, these were my role models.
My mom was lost at that particular moment.
She was addicted to crack.
It was hard.
It was hard because she was my hero.
I was asked by a group of children what to do if they were offered drugs.
And I answered, "Just say no."
I was broke.
I didn' t have enough credits to graduate, so I dropped out.
I gotta make a living. "
I started selling drugs for maybe two weeks.
The dude was like, "Give me my drugs back," because I didn' t know how.
The dope dealers used to look out for me.
They would give me money and be like, "Don' t get involved with this.
Get out there, do your dream. "
So they was like my sponsors.
My dream was to make a living rapping.
Just to make music that was coming from my heart.
When I first started rapping, I needed the money, and I had to work.
That was me.
For me to get paid, I had to go out in bikini briefs and hop on top of this doll.
I was homeless.
That' s what I had to do.
You have to work from one point to go to another point.
I admire the work ethic.
Shock was responsible for my success.
I' m the original two- tone, big- nosed, skinny rapper.
Shock G.
Leila introduced me to Atron who was managing Digital Underground.
He was like, "I' il send you to Digital Underground.
They' re in the studio.
"Rap for Shock G on the spot.
If he like you, I' il pick you up. "
I walked in and rapped.
He was like, "Good.
You' re in. "
Boom, boom.
"See you later."
And I left, walked out of there like, "Dang."
Shock was like, "Come on the road.
It ain' t glamorous.
"You' il be working, meeting people."
I said, "Cool."
Off the road, he said, "I' m gonna pay you and let you do 'Same Song'."
I did "Same Song".
Ever since, it' s been on.
I look back with the greatest fondness.
Those were some of the best times.
Watch this one.
I' m gonna fuck you up.
I' m gonna fuck you up.
Atron had been shopping my demo tape as a solo album.
All of a sudden, Interscope got in touch with us, and I was told that Ted Field, this millionaire, multimillionaire, his daughter had heard my demo, and she liked it.
So he was like, "That' s how I picked you."
And I was like, "Well, tell your daughter thanks."
So I went from being unknown to now having a platinum record.
2Pacalypse Now is a story of a young black male, from track one to track 13, whether it be about teenage pregnancy, police brutality or poverty.
Also, I tell my own personal problems.
All my songs deal with the pain that I' ve felt from my childhood.
That' s what makes me do what I do.
My inspiration for writing music is, like, Don McLean when he did "Vincent",
Lorraine Hansberry with Raisin in the Sun,
Shakespeare when he does his things.
Like deep stories, you know, like raw human needs.
I just try to speak about things that affect me and our community.
Sometimes I' m the watcher and sometimes the participant.
Sometimes it' s just allegories or fables that have a moral or theme, like the ghetto lifestyle.
Iosing everything and being poor and getting beat down.
Being the person I am, I said, "No, I' m changing this."
I' m trying to think of a good analogy.
It' s like you' ve got the Vietnam War, right?
And just because the reporters show us pictures at home of the Vietnam War, that' s what made the Vietnam War end when it did, or the shit probably would have lasted longer.
If no one knew exactly what was going on, we just thought they were just dying valiantly, in some beautiful way.
But because we saw the horror, that' s what made us stop the Vietnam War.
I thought, "That' s what I' il do as an artist, as a rapper.
"I' m gonna show the graphic details of what I see
"and my community, and hopefully they' il stop it, quit."
Hello, I' m Tanya Hart, and welcome to our show.
My guest today has experienced a truly horrendous life to just be 20 years old.
His family portrait could well be a poster for America' s Most Wanted.
His lyrics are controversial but also a reality of life as he has seen it.
My ear is to the streets.
I represent 20 years on this planet Earth and what I' ve seen.
It' s like my battle cry to America.
In my album, the number one enemy is the crooked police officer.
And the ironic thing is that it never happened to me.
I was speaking from the stories of my peers.
I mean, I said all of these things, and then it happened to me.
I had no record, all my life, no police record, until I made a record.
As my video was debuting on MTV, I was behind bars, getting beat up by the police department.
Good morning.
My name is John Burris, and I am here today with my client, Tupac Amaru Shakur, as well as other members of the Digital Underground rap group and some members of the Digital Underground rap group, a combination of the various groups.
Basically, I walked across the street at 17th and Broadway.
The police officers stopped me on the sidewalk and asked to see my ID.
They sweated me about my name.
The officers said:
"You have to learn your place."
They were charging me with jaywalking.
I was riffing, arguing about why would they charge me with a petty crime.
I kept yelling, asking them to give me my citation and let me go.
Next thing I know, my face was being buried into the concrete, and I was laying facedown in the gutter, waking up from being unconscious in cuffs with blood on my face.
And I' m going to jail for resisting arrest.
like we' re in South Africa and asked for my ID.
Officer Boyavich repeatedly slammed my face into the floor, while Rogers put the cuffs on.
That' s not called for, for jaywalking.
I got a ten- million- dollar lawsuit.
They said they would settle, but nobody cared.
That wasn' t blew up all over the news.
They didn' t see me on TV with my eye and head busted.
There are pictures.
- In Oakland?
You don' t see them.
You see pictures of Tupac coming out of jail in cuffs.
You don' t see pictures of police, beating my brains in.
You don' t see that.
That' s what I see.
We have seen what they did to Rodney King.
The whole world has seen what happened to Rodney King.
Baby, let me show you what they did to Tupac Shakur.
All that movie, that didn' t mean nothing to OPD.
I was still an N- l- G- G- A, and they proved it.
And if you can see this, Mr. Cameraman,
- This is scars I' il go to my grave with.
- I can see it.
These are "learn to be a nigger" scars.
- You' re suing them?
- For ten mil.
What else can I do?
See what happens.
You know how that go.
Rodney King' s still fighting for his, and they got it on tape.
They got it on tape.
- They settled with me.
- They did?
They gave me 42, 000.
I had to pay my lawyer a whole bunch and bought a car.
I settled because I was tired of court.
I could have won more, but I was tired of going to court.
I felt like any dollar from any police department was good money.
- So you got $42, 000 for jaywalking?
- That' s a hell of a ticket.
After that case, people perceived me as a menace.
Everybody against me.
Why me?
I have not brought violence to you.
I have not brought Thug Life to America.
I didn' t create Thug Life.
What' s up?
When I did Juice, my image got even more scary.
Everything starts from now.
We all go down unless we stay together.
No one' s above the crew.
You know that shit.
You' re crazy, man.
When I auditioned for Juice, that was another good- luck time.
It was my first big part, and I just took everything and internalized it.
You' re right.
I am crazy.
But you know what else?
I don' t give a fuck.
Bishop is a lonely, misguided, young kid.
His heroes are James Cagney and Scarface, those kind of guys.
- Made it, Ma.
Top of the world.
- "Made it, Ma.
Top of the world. "
Know what I' m saying, "shoot them up, go out in a blaze" type gangsters.
If you' ve gotta go out, that' s how you go out.
That motherfucker took his destiny in his own hands.
When I get a part, at first I just try to find out, how does this character feel?
Like, I make the person up in my mind.
What he looks like, try to put a face to him.
Even though it' s my face, I' il give him a walk and give him an attitude.
All you have to do is relate to your character.
Even away from the set I just let myself go.
I just stopped caring.
I stopped worrying about what people thought and started staring people down more.
I really just got into the part.
- Yo, Bishop, man, give me the piece.
- No.
What the hell you mean, no?
Give me the gun.
I mean I' m holding onto this till I say so.
I' m not playing.
Oh, really?
When I' m playing a character, I' m really that character.
There' s nothing fake.
Oh, shit!
I just took everything and internalized it.
Tell us about your character.
I know you' re the villain.
Yo, I play me, straight ruthless villain, straight killer, straight take no sszzz- s.
You know what I' m saying?
Straight popping partners.
Yo, Tupac will go ahead and rock this.
Juice helped me because it gave me that trust.
It let me trust my instincts.
I was confident about what I could do and what it would look like afterwards.
My next guest has not only become one of today' s most talented new stars, but he' s becoming one of today' s most talked about new stars.
Please welcome Tupac Shakur.
I know what I feel like when I' m in the zone, when I' m there.
So I was just trying to get that feeling.
Why are you always so mad?
The exciting performance in the film is the one of Tupac Shakur.
What do you want from me?
I think you' re kind of fly.
We could start with your phone number.
This is a 22- year- old young actor, Tupac Shakur.
He' s been in the film Juice, and I hope to see him again soon.
When I was doing Poetic Justice, I had to tone myself down a lot to be Lucky.
Lucky is doing the opposite of Bishop.
He' s working, responsible, deliberate about things, caring for his daughter.
I' m a Gemini, so I got both sides.
See, I get a feeling there are two Tupacs.
See, I mean, you' re this kind, sensitive, friendly guy, yet you' re involved in so much controversy.
I' m talking about Tupac Shakur, who had an incident with a limo driver during a taping of In Living Color.
Tupac Shakur is free on bond tonight after his arrest this weekend in Atlanta.
The 22- year- old singer and actor was charged with shooting two off- duty police officers.
The wounds were not serious.
The fight that led to the shooting in Marin City reportedly broke out in this field on Saturday night.
Marin Festival USA was in full swing.
Neighbors say Tupac should not have let anyone bring a gun here.
Since he got big, they claim he' s changed.
That change has broken some hearts.
Tupac was homeless.
He' s from here.
We helped him out.
Over my career, I got arrested, like, 12 times, some by mistake, some fate and some unwarranted.
But for whatever reason, I got to see police more than I wanted to.
In some of my cases, they dropped the charges.
But because of trouble in these court cases, it was hard at that point for me to be trying to do a movie.
I wasn' t professional.
I think I was talented, but I didn' t have the concentration.
And I was immature, and my ego was out of control.
Harry Connick ain' t got nothing on me.
I had to get humble again before I could do this.
More hot water may await Tupac, based on what he tells the new issue of The Source about costarring with Janet Jackson in her film debut, Poetic Justice.
Tupac says Janet' s people asked him to take an AlDS test
- Before shooting a love scene.
- I don' t know if it came from Janet, but suddenly they wanted me to take an AlDS test for this love scene.
I did not disagree if we were really gonna make love.
I said, "If we can make love, I' il take four AlDS tests."
But if I' m doing a love scene with her just like somebody else did, and they didn' t take a test, I' m not.
Not only am I not taking a test, but get out of my trailer.
And they sent, like, four different people to ask me.
First they sent the producer, then the black dude, then John, then a girl.
It don' t matter who you send, I' m not taking one.
To me, it was just like an insult.
We had a good experience on the set.
- You look like the type of guy to care.
- What' s the type?
I thought I made a friend.
I thought, "I know Janet Jackson for life."
When the movie was over, it was like, "This number has been changed."
And it was like a movie.
I mean, it was like the day after the movie wrapped.
"I' m gonna call you."
"This number' s been changed."
I said, "Oh, OK."
Still, when I see her again, I' d run up and hug her.
I love women.
I' m not gonna lie.
I love women with a passion.
Sometimes I just wanna call Prince and be like, "Can we hang?"
Because I love women like he love women.
Hold on.
I' ve been talking to little girls all day.
Seeing somebody my age.
How you doing?
- Fine, how you doing?
- Yourself?
I have ultra respect for women.
I' m comfortable with them on every level.
I don' t get a predator thing going when I' m around demure females.
- Don' t be shy.
- Y' all making me blush.
You got me blushing.
I' m not uncomfortable around strong women.
I' m not enough.
- No, I' m looking you up and down.
On TV, they' il go, "Look how he looking at Tabitha."
Don' t do that.
Madonna is real nice.
She helped me a lot.
She was real cool, like any one of my homeboys.
Jasmine Guy, she helped me.
She' s a good supporter.
Jada Pinkett.
Jada' s my heart, you know what I mean?
She will be my friend for my whole life.
Well, I' il scoop you up later in life if you ain' t all shriveled up.
We' il be old together.
Be like Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee.
Pic, you always got a place in my heart.
She can have my one heart, my liver, my lungs, my kidneys, my blood, marrow, all of that.
My mother taught me to understand women a lot more than my peers can.
When I was young, I was surrounded by strong women.
My sister' s the bomb.
She' s my biggest critic.
She' s real smart, funny as all hell.
She' s real funny.
My mother was a matriarch.
If you raised by a woman, you' re gonna think like a woman.
But I' m not a woman.
I' m just a normal man.
To me, I' m the hardest man around, the hardest nigga, because I' m real.
But I' m also very soft.
I' m very sensitive, but that' s why I' m so harsh, because I' m so sensitive.
And that' s what I think has made me successful and famous.
So sensitive.
Don' t be so sensitive, Tupac.
- Well, basically...
- Bugaloo.
Bugaloo?
Boogaloo?
Marlon Wayans, I am playing the role of Bugaloo.
- What is Bugaloo?
- Where did that name come from?
Some white guy' s sitting there, "What' s a homeboy hip- hop name?
Bugaloo! "
"What are they calling each other these days?"
When I got famous, I got famous friends.
Mickey Rourke was a good friend, good person.
He' s really funny.
My memory of him is the night he' s arguing with Carré, his wife.
He didn' t know what to do.
I was like, "Man, buy her some Cristal.
"Cristal will make someone forgive you, trust me."
They be like, "What was we fighting about?"
He' s like, "That' s a good idea, 'Pac."
I was like, "He gotta be twice my age,
"and I' m giving him ideas."
I always gave Biggie a lot of props.
The Notorious B. I. G.
I thought at the time he was my friend.
Mike Tyson, we used to kick it.
He' s a real cool brother, a big brother.
The only difference in us is that he' s big and I' m small.
But I got the same heart he got.
I want to knock everybody out.
My brother, I' m telling you, you were good.
- I enjoyed your performance.
- Appreciate it.
Thank you very much.
I like that people come to me and go, "You did a good job."
I was loving that somebody said, "Tupac, you a great actor."
- I' m telling you, Tupac a real nigga.
- Being famous gave me confidence.
- Is Tupac a sexy motherfucker?
- The crowd gave me confidence.
- Go Tupac, go Tupac, go.
- Let me hear you say:
- "Go Thug Life, go Thug Life, go."
- Go Thug Life, go Thug Life, go.
That' s what I wanna hear.
Now, I' m my own man.
I got you now!
I wanna get into the head seat.
Do it one more time, clear as possible.
Can we double it, see what it sound like?
I' m a natural- born leader.
If not, everybody lose their jobs.
Everybody lose their jobs!
Back to servant.
Playing the drums in the corner.
But nobody could call me a sellout.
I' m not going for that.
I didn' t want to change.
I' il be up at the dirtiest house party in the 'hood.
I used to thrive off that.
Being up in the party, and somebody go, "Oh, my God, that' s Tupac."
lights out, drinking, hella drunk.
Drunk with everybody else.
But that' s what kept my sanity, kept me right, kept me going.
My fans know that I' m real.
My fans go to jail just like me.
They understand me.
Half my fans are white.
The white fans listen as much as the black fans.
The ones that have approached me have been genuine fans.
These people will have jobs in the future and will hire my family.
Get down, man!
But many of my fans don' t have ID.
Some have jobs, some don' t.
Some are on welfare, you know?
Some are rich and some are poor, but they all share that hopeless feeling.
I got the underdogs on my side.
I' m almost more in awe of the people in awe of me than they are of me.
Outlaw, outlaw, outlaw
Everybody just be screaming, and I get uncomfortable.
It' s similar to a deer caught in the headlights.
It' s like a battle to find the right words to say at the right time.
It was cool.
I got to speak to young black males all over the country about this new idea called "Thug Life"...... which is a new kind of Black Power.
When I say, "Thug Life", I mean that shit because these white folks see us as thugs.
I don' t care if you think you a lawyer, a man, an African- American.
If you whatever the fuck you think you are, we thugs and niggas to these motherfuckers!
Until we own some shit, I' il call it like it is.
How you gonna be a man and we starving?
Walk about five different houses, there ain' t a man in either one of them motherfuckers.
How we gonna be African- Americans if we all need a gun?
We thugs and niggas until we set this shit right.
Trust me when I tell you that shit.
Young black males identify with Thug Life, but I couldn' t handle it.
I could handle it, but not right away.
- Mr. Shakur, can we get a comment?
Thug Life.
- Pardon me?
- Thug Life.
That' s my comment.
What' s that mean?
I don' t understand.
- What did happen?
- Thug Life.
Imagine you have 14, 000 people ready to do whatever you want.
You have, all over the country, people waiting to hear what you wanna do.
I got people in the penitentiary, bigtime OG criminals, calling me, telling me they want me to lead their movement.
I mean, I' m gonna have a problem.
So they told me to watch my language.
Fuck that.
I' m gonna have a small identity crisis.
"who wants to take orders from me, who wants to know what I wanna do."
Wants to know my plan for young black males.
That makes me scared.
And I' m 22.
I was having concerts sold out, white boys, Mexicans, blacks, and they would do what I say.
I could tell them to turn in a circle, and they would do it.
like, undeniable love, and I was scared.
I was scared, but so was America, so was somebody else.
- I' m a liberal Democrat.
- I' m a conservative Republican, but we both worry about the society our children live in.
But that makes me want to rise to the occasion.
It makes me want to give my whole life to it.
And I will give my whole life to this plan that I have for Thug Life.
That' s my new posse, my new way of thinking.
That' s how we rolling in the nine- three, Thug Life.
By "thug", I mean, not criminal, someone that beats you.
I mean, the underdog.
The person that had nothing and succeeds is a thug because he overcame all obstacles.
It has nothing to do with the dictionary' s version.
To me, thug is my pride, not being someone that goes against the law, not being someone that takes, but being someone that has nothing, and even though I have nothing and no home to go to, my head is up high.
My chest is out.
I talk loud.
I' m being strong.
I' m against racial, ethnic entitlements.
I think they are un- American.
I don' t understand why America doesn' t get Thug Life.
America is Thug Life.
How is me saying, "I don' t give a fuck," different than Patrick Henry saying, "Give me liberty or give me death"?
What makes my freedom less worth fighting for than Bosnians or whoever they wanna fight for this year?
They should give money to the ghetto.
Even gangs can be positive.
It just has to be organized.
It has to steer away from being self - destructive to being self- productive.
I organized the OGs on the East and West Coasts in penitentiaries to come up with codes of ethics for criminals.
It' s called the Code of Thug Life.
It' s a code, putting order to the violence on the streets.
In Watts, Compton, Chicago, wherever.
People all over the country say, "We go by this code.
"We' re against attacks on people not involved with the street gang,
"the drug trade or the illegal business at all.
"All that kidnapping and shooting drive- bys, we against that."
Thug Life ain' t just a bunch of niggas going crazy.
We wanna patrol our streets.
So all we saying is, if every motherfucker out here right now gave up one dollar to this Thug Life fund, the money don' t go to me, it go to somebody from y' all neighborhood, and we do this shit every month.
I' il bring Snoop, whoever y' all want.
I' il go snatch them niggas.
For that shit to happen, we can' t have violence, and everybody gotta be down for that shit.
We gonna start slowly but surely taking our communities back.
Regulate our community.
Start taking care of our own.
We gotta start somewhere, and I don' t know about anything but this.
- What is the message, though?
- All the people you threw away, the dope dealers, criminals, they will be legit next to you in first class, thanks to your boy.
You know those little things for mice, where they go through and there' s little blocks?
Well, society is like that.
They' il let you go as far as you want, but when you ask too many questions and you' re ready to change, boom, that block' il come.
There is no reason for a record like this to be published by a responsible corporation.
Never before has there been such a will to use music to advertise self- destructive violence.
It glorifies violence.
It' s creating a culture of guns and rape.
Adding insult to injury, she says, is rapper Tupac Shakur being nominated for an NAACP lmage Award.
I got the whole world fearing me, and I ain' t even started.
I don' t have my plan, and they' re trying to stop me.
I challenge the view that those who revel in violence and depravity, on the screen or in the song, bear no responsibility when that spirit spreads into our culture.
He don' t know what he talking about.
He' s just talking.
Some card somebody gave him, he' s just reading off a card.
But he' s cute, you know?
He' s my grandfather.
- Right.
- He' s an old dude, talking mess.
You don' t have to use vile and ugly language.
WPGC in Washington, D. C. dropped violent or demeaning lyrics.
KACE in Los Angeles followed suit.
You' re yelling, "Shoot!" in a community that is crowded with guns.
I' m not looking for approval from the black community.
I' m a thug, and I rap about the oppressed fighting back.
Yes, my raps are filled with rage.
If I know that in this hotel room
If I know that in this hotel room they have food every day, and I' m knocking on the door every day to eat, and they open the door, let me see the party,
I mean, just throwing food around, but they' re telling me there' s no food.
Every day, I' m standing outside trying to sing my way in.
We are hungry, please let us in We are hungry, please let us in
After about a week that song is gonna change to:
We hungry, we need some food
After two, three weeks, it' s like:
Give me the food Or I' m breaking down the door
After a year you' re just like:
I' m picking the lock Coming through the door blasting
It' s like, you hungry, you reached your level.
We asked ten years ago.
We was asking with the Panthers.
We was asking with them, the Civil Rights Movement.
We was asking.
Those people that asked are dead and in jail.
So now what do you think we' re gonna do?
There' s a bad part because kids see that and mimic you.
I haven' t figured that out yet.
But the positive side is the kids who live in a house where the mother is a crackhead, he hears the rap.
He' s like, "That' s every day.
"So I don' t have to feel ashamed."
It cuts both ways.
To me, it' s like, when I sing:
I live the Thug Life Baby, I' m hopeless
One person might hear that and just like the way it sounds.
But I' m doing it for the kid that lives a Thug Life and feels like it' s hopeless.
So when I say, "Hopeless", and when I say it like that, it' s like I reach him.
It' s a fad.
He' il drop the Thug Life soon.
But for the person I tried to reach, he' il pick it up, and I' il be able to talk to him.
I try to be responsible, but it' s hard.
If you worry about what you' re saying, I get writer' s block.
Kind of like, "I can' t say that.
Can' t say this. "
I have to block it out and trust my heart that I' m doing the right thing.
I was spitting.
- Chill out.
- That' s my style.
That' s my new style.
- That' s my new style.
- 'Pac, chill out.
That' s my new style.
Hey, have a good summer.
Have a good summer, bitch!
But I' m not saying I didn' t make mistakes.
Like some of the things I said when I was fighting the Hughes brothers.
I beat up the directors to Menace II Society.
- All right, tell them why you did that.
- These chump, punk, slump...
- You' il be able to rebuttal to that.
- No, they better come now.
Check this out, they fired me in a roundabout, punk, snitch way.
So I caught them on the streets and beat they behinds.
I was a menace to the Hughes brothers.
I still got more for you chumps!
I read what you said about me!
I' m gonna kick their ass!
My big mouth.
Mind y' all business, I' il mind mine.
I do what I gotta do, you do what you gotta do.
Long as I give you 12 tracks, you give me my $12, and we even.
I don' t gotta be a role model.
I don' t gotta hold your hand.
I don' t gotta do shit.
My big mouth.
I got a big mouth, can' t help it.
- I talk from my heart, I' m real.
- We talked about people in this business that you feel don' t have a love for their own people.
We was talking about Spike Lee, Arsenio Hall,
Eddie Murphy and the rest of them.
I thought I was charming, but I was immature.
I did things without thinking.
Michael Jackson, Randy Jackson,
Janet Jackson, Paula Abdul, all of them.
She wants to not be black, but sell to blacks.
I don' t appreciate her going out of her way to say she' s not black.
My actions came before thought.
Things that I did, things I said.
So many things I wanna take back.
Eddie Murphy, with all that dough he' s making, hasn' t done nothing for us.
- He does a lot of charity.
- Charity doesn' t get to the ghetto.
Everybody knows that.
I was young and dumb.
Being mad at Spike Lee and all those people, all of that.
The thing I said of Quincy Jones, he shouldn' t mess with white women.
I said I was sorry personally for that.
I didn' t think of how it would hurt people.
I' m gonna catch y' all in traffic and be the roughest nigga you ever seen.
That turned into more legal problems.
The People truly believe that Mr. Shakur has shown no remorse whatsoever for his action in this case.
We view Mr. Shakur' s appearance on Yo!
MTV Raps as bragging.
He was proud of what he did and does not feel sorry.
I just want to say, judge, that I have a great deal of remorse.
As far as I want you to treat me different, I don' t want that.
I just want the chance to make right from all the bad things that I got.
I got things against me and people that look up to me.
I don' t want the last place they see me to be jail.
I guess it' s now time for me to render the sentence.
I obviously find that the defendant is a talented individual.
However, this court believes that jail time is warranted with a battery with some injury involved.
The defendant will serve 15 days in the county jail.
I think the judge was fair.
I still don' t feel like I got the decision that I wanted, but he was as fair as he could be.
Really, to my homeboys, I mean, a fight is a fight, battery is battery.
A two and a half minute problem just cost me 15 days in jail, and that was lenient.
But my most serious legal problems came from women.
How I was acting with women.
I will no longer sit passively, allowing this degradation to be continued by our children.
I think we live in a very sexist society, and everybody' s pointing the finger at me.
When somebody asks me, "Do you exploit women?"
With her permission, I might smack a girl on the butt in the video.
I might be drinking champagne, but everything in moderation, and everything with class.
I don' t have to always do a song with the good woman.
I don' t see women as all one thing.
I think all women are different.
We African- American women, particularly, are tired of being called ho' s, bitches and sluts by our children.
If I do something that has a bad woman, people go, "He hates women."
If I do something that has a bad woman, people go, "He hates women."
I don' t think like that.
label them a bitch, whose main thing is to get what they can, and they revel in breaking a nigga' s heart and taking what he owns.
Shut the fuck up!
There' s male bitches too.
Women know there are bitches.
I don' t know why they' re surprised.
They know.
They say it louder.
They think we say they' re all bitches.
That' s not what we' re saying.
That' s "Keep Ya Head Up" and "Get Around".
I said, "I' m gonna write a song about women like my mom,
"who represent a strong black woman." I did that.
That' s "Get Around".
If I just did "Keep Ya Head Up", it makes me seem more than I am, but I' m just a normal man.
America, America
- God shed his grace on thee - Stop.
I' m gonna close the door.
Come on, Mr. Cameraman.
This is some real private shit that' s about to happen, Mr. Cameraman.
Bye.
Anyway, I' il let you hear the sounds.
Is there a double standard for men being promiscuous?
Yeah, but we didn' t start that double standard.
- I' m not saying you did.
- And I' m not saying it' s fair.
I' m saying this is how it is.
How can we rap about a world that is not like that?
- This is how it is.
- Do you look down on males if they' re as promiscuous as women?
I don' t look down on anybody that' s promiscuous.
I only look down on people who don' t control the situation.
If a girl sleeps with a lot of guys, she' s still my homegirl.
You' re only a bitch, not if you sleep with a lot of guys, but if you' re sleeping with them for money.
- So you put a price on yourself.
- Because they have a nice car.
Guys, when they sleep around, they do it for free.
At that time, a lot of girls, they' d seen my face on TV so many times, they wanna be associated with that person.
It' s the fame that gets these people.
It' s the fame.
I' ve seen females look at me when they didn' t know me, and I can see it, nothing.
Then someone whisper who I was, it' s this glare in the eye.
- You make yourself want them.
- How do you feel about that?
I don' t understand how people can stand next to you one year, and next year, they cannot.
They' re going crazy, screaming.
They can' t take it that you' re there.
But last year I was in the same club, walking around, lonely like a motherfucker.
Couldn' t get a date or a dance.
I was too skinny, too something, and now, "He' s just adorable.
But I still enjoyed sex without the emotional connection.
And it was always a fantasy for me to have sex with a lot of people in the room.
But I didn' t play one situation correctly.
Rap singer Tupac Shakur was released on $50, 000 bail today, accused of a sexual attack in a New York hotel.
The singer was arrested Thursday night after a woman claimed he and three other men overpowered her in a hotel suite.
- Are you disappointing your fans?
- Very, but they' re gonna support me.
With bodyguards and attorneys, he went into Manhattan Criminal Court.
There, the rapper and two friends were charged with first- degree sodomy.
The allegations stem from an incident last Thursday in which a woman claims she was held down as he and two others allegedly sodomized her.
The allegations by this young lady are without merit.
Defense attorneys say the woman went there consensually, and answering machine tapes that indicate her interest in Shakur were erased by police.
OK, so you tell me when your lawyers have asked you to stop.
The girl who claims that...
What does she claim?
- I can' t even say it, man.
But technically, it' s a rape case.
I wasn' t convicted of no rape charge.
My charge was sexual abuse, forcibly touching the buttocks.
I have a female saying that...
I can' t say it, but...
It just bothers me so much, you know?
To go through my life and everything I did, coming out of a family and household with just women, to get to this point to have a woman say that I took something from her.
It was hard.
It was an emotional day for a 20- year- old female fan, who admitted that she had consensual sex with Shakur on Sunday night, four days before her alleged rape in the hotel room.
During her cross- examination, defense attorney Michael Warren painted a picture of a starstruck, naive girl anxious to have sex with Shakur.
Word is, you had a relationship with this woman prior to all this friction.
If you can say that' s a relationship.
I bumped in a club.
Let' s use a clinical term.
There was oral copulation?
Yeah, she performed oral sex on the dance floor.
A lot of guys could say what they wouldn' t do and what they would do, but when it happens, you know...?
- Yeah.
- It just goes down.
And it' s...
She did some things there at the club, and we got together later that night.
I saw her again another time with these guys that introduced me to her.
Everybody was having a good time, nothing sexual, just a good time.
Me and her went in, she gave me a massage, went to sleep, woke up, she' s screaming, "Rape, rape." I raped her.
And she' s yelling at me, "This is not the last you' re gonna see of me."
I' m cursing her out because I' m not thinking she' s really gonna do that.
And the next thing I know, I' m going to jail.
In your opinion there was no truth to the sexual abuse charges?
Not on my part at all.
The defense pounded away at her, asking her why she didn' t scream for help at the time of the alleged attack.
The woman testified that Shakur' s friends said:
"Tupac needs his fans.
Don' t go to the White Man with this.
"Millions of girls would love to be in your shoes right now."
What about your cronies?
That was a big misconception.
The people with me weren' t friends.
- Why were they in your room?
- I hang with lots of people.
And that' s how I am.
It' s similar to like you said, about Led Zeppelin.
They don' t know all of the people with them.
This guy got the weed?
OK, you can kick it.
Got the money?
You can kick it.
This guy has connections to the clubs?
OK, you can kick it.
But that was my fault, I had that kind of environment around me.
I didn' t do nothing.
I' m charged with being in concert with some guys.
Well, where are they at?
Why me?
Because I' m Tupac...
I' m mad at the system.
I don' t want nobody to go to jail, but I don' t wanna go for something I didn' t do.
I just don' t wanna be the scapegoat.
I just couldn' t believe this was going on in my life.
See the cameras.
It wasn' t like I had a chance for justice like a normal citizen.
Hi, Tupac.
Can you tell me how you' re doing today?
Well, I just had to listen to the prosecution' s closing argument, and it was so far from the truth that it has me drained at the end of the day.
But I' m leaving it in the hands of the jury.
I' m learning a lot about people' s innermost fears in this trial.
It' s just about
Ioud rap music, tattoo- having thugs.
It' s about some nightmare that these people are having.
I can' t understand why it' s so close.
There' s no evidence I sodomized her, even though you put that in the paper.
Print the facts so everybody can sort it out.
My life is ruined because nobody has a chance to get the facts.
Fact is, there was no semen found.
No semen found, no forcible entry, no entry into the anal, no nothing.
I wanted to explain it.
- Is there anything you' d do differently?
- Yeah.
I would not have closed my eyes until she was out of the room, until everybody was out of the room.
So when you left the room and left her with those people...
I didn' t leave her with those people or bring her to them.
- She came over?
She came over, knew those people, knew everything.
I just didn' t grab her out of there.
I guess, or being more considerate.
At any point, were you aware she was involved in something she...
- Cut.
- Excuse me.
None of these legal matters can be asked.
I have a list of the stuff you' il have to cut out.
Sorry.
- All right.
- The gentleman is out on bail.
I see.
I couldn' t defend myself.
This would never have happened to anybody else.
They have no evidence on me, and it' s about to come out.
Now my life is over.
This is a year later.
A year after the world' s been thinking I' m a rapist.
The whole world owes me an apology.
I went through it and didn' t kill myself like Kurt Cobain.
And I should, because this is some crazy madness.
Central, I got a black male shot at 48th and 7th.
Last night, just after midnight, at 723 7th Avenue, that' s between 48th and 49th Street, rap star Tupac Shakur and three members of his group were robbed and shot.
They shot me, straight up.
I just kept thinking, "They really did shoot me."
When I wasn' t dead, immediately I was like, "Oh, man."
I was like, "No, this ain' t it."
I know how it' s gonna be when I die.
It' s gonna be no noise.
You ain' t gonna hear people screaming.
I' m gonna fade out.
And I didn' t...
None of that was there.
I was like, "I got shot five times.
I' m not dead.
They missed.
When Shakur resisted, he was shot five times, twice in the head and twice in the groin area.
And his most serious wound, a gunshot through the hand, hitting an artery in his thigh.
He' s listed in serious but stable condition.
Until it happened, I really did believe no black person would ever shoot me.
I believed that I didn' t have to fear my own community.
You know, I was like, "I represent them.
"I' m their ambassador to the world.
They would never do me wrong. "
I believe that this was a robbery.
Anybody who was gonna walk into that building was gonna be robbed.
The police don' t wanna find out who shot me.
They' re happy.
As far as that Vibe interview, just read everything over and read my reply, read their reply, read what people say.
Everybody that was there knows what happened.
My recollection was, I was shooting a video, the second half of "Warning", which is the B- side of "Big Poppa", and I was shooting around the block.
And I heard my man was up at the studio doing a Junior M. A. F. I. A. session.
So I got off at the reception area, and I saw Andre and Little Shawn.
I said, "What' s up?" about to get on the elevator, and he comes out shot.
The Tupac article had me pissed off, you know what I' m saying?
Because first of all, he dissed my man, saying he turned his back on him, and I know for a fact it didn' t happen.
And, like, the rumors that' s spreading is on some tip like we set him up.
As soon as he comes out shot, me and my man try to sit him down.
He called his mom.
He asked my man if he can roll him a blunt.
We asked if he was all right.
He' s like, "Yeah, I don' t know what' s going on."
We were just trying to comfort him.
Andre Harrell called the ambulance.
And everybody there was very supportive of him.
It was just the total opposite.
He came out and everyone ran to him.
It was nothing but love and concern.
They got different accounts of it, and I' m the one with the bullet wounds.
I also understand that if you was to get shot five times, your mind is just completely spinning.
You' re real confused about your situation.
It' il make you say things you don' t mean.
I was there for the whole thing.
No one else was there for the whole thing.
I don' t know the purpose of why the story was said in another context.
It' s not important that others know what happened.
Now that I said it, it' s dead.
Believe me or not, I did what I had to.
God knows the truth.
There' s no religion about getting shot.
I don' t want any converts.
After getting shot, I was like, "Shit, I don' t know who to trust."
Tupac Shakur checked himself out of Bellevue Hospital Wednesday night.
After surgery, Tupac checked himself out of Bellevue against doctor' s orders.
It was just time to leave.
I didn' t feel safe there.
I kept getting these crazy phone calls.
At that point, I' m just paranoid, just bugging out.
I couldn' t sleep or rest.
I was like, "I' m just tired, and I wanna just..."
And I felt like I' m like a victim, a target.
I couldn' t even sleep at home.
People could kill me at home.
And are the police gonna come in and kill me?
You know, is there secret police?
I was so deep into the weed at that point.
I' m vulnerable. "
I felt like just a prisoner to my own fame.
That' s why I wanted to die at that point.
I felt like, "If everybody' s so worried, why ain' t nobody came to help?"
- Mr. Shakur?
- Open up, please.
- Excuse me.
- Step back, please.
- Just keep it tight, that' s all.
- How are you this morning?
Tupac Shakur has finally had one question answered.
Tonight, the jury found him guilty of three counts of sexual abuse, but innocent on six other charges, including sodomy.
Please, man.
Why did you decide to leave the hospital?
Please, y' all are not letting me get through, man.
Let me get through!
- Back it up.
- Why did you leave?
And sentencing for this trial has yet to be scheduled.
Where I was sent was a maximum- security penitentiary.
I know when I was young, I couldn' t wait to get to jail, straight up.
I mean, I was scared and everything, but I felt that' s part of being a man.
Now that I' m here, this is not the spot.
I know everybody that comes out says, "This ain' t the spot." This isn' t the spot.
Somebody tells you when to get up, when you can shower, do this, do that.
They can speak to you any way they want to, and you' ve gotta accept it.
You can die here, know what I mean?
Yesterday, a dude was murdered.
He was in on a drug beef.
He' s gone.
He' s dead in jail, you know what I mean?
By another prisoner who had life.
He had nothing to lose, you know what I mean?
I came to jail.
It' s filthy.
It' s like you' re an animal.
At first, me and the guards had problems.
I got smacked and treated bad.
They did whatever they could to break me because I used to talk a lot of shit.
As soon as I got there, they went, "There he goes, the rich nigger."
I was like, "Oh, shit, he said nigger!"
Everybody' s looking at me like, "So?"
And I was like, "My God, this is where I' m gonna be staying?"
He just said "nigger"!
You' ve got "niggas" in one of your records.
Niggas.
He' s talking about niggers.
Niggers was the ones on the rope, hanging off the thing.
Niggas is the ones with gold ropes, hanging out at clubs.
I learned things there.
In jail, it' s like how we should be in life, humble.
I was talking to skinheads because if you don' t like black people, all right, that' s fine.
That' s your opinion.
I want people to respect my opinion when I' m rapping, so I' il respect yours.
You treat me with respect, I' il treat you with respect, and we' il get along.
This skinhead, "hate black people" all over, getting autographs for cousins.
I accomplished something.
I know, by him getting my autograph, that meant something to me.
He couldn' t hate black people and get my autograph.
- The food was terrible, I guess.
- Oh, my goodness.
They' ve got this liver surprise thing.
They' re trying to pump that jail on the menu.
They' re trying to get it to go prime- time, get it in the rotation.
I was like, "We had this yesterday.
I liked it already, goddamn. "
- No Tater Tots?
- No.
Are you crazy?
Tater Tots?
I used to get baked potatoes with a huge finger imprint on it.
- All right.
No, you don' t wanna get me started.
Jell- O with hair all in the mold.
I' d be like, "Damn, man, how are you gonna mess up Jell- O?"
Jell- O is so wholesome and family- like.
It just ruins it for me.
To have a hair in there, yeah.
I mean, I' m like, "Come on, Bill Cosby pumps this, man!"
Put the hair in my Jell- O.
And you can' t go, "There' s a hair in my Jell- O. I' d like to send this back.
"Can I see the cook, please?"
The cook is a big dude named Bubba Joe.
The first eight months I spent in solitude 23 hours a day, reading.
I wrote a script called Live 2 Tell.
I got How to Write a Screenplay, that big famous book by Syd Field.
I got that, and I remembered all of the scripts I ever read, and I wrote one.
I read a lot of good books.
I read a lot of Maya Angelou' s books.
The Art of War by Sun Tzu.
But in terms of writing music and lyrics, I couldn' t do it.
Everybody' s like, "He' s in jail now.
But it' s the opposite.
Prison kills your spirit, straight up.
I couldn' t write.
My inspiration was gone because I was a caged animal.
But when I was in jail, a lot of people supported me.
Jasmine Guy, Jada Pinkett,
Mickey Rourke, he just wrote me funny stories.
The name that sticks out the most, I' il keep saying this, is Tony Danza.
To me, he is the bomb forever.
I will be his number one fan forever, because when I got his letter, I was like, "Whoa!"
I was screaming out to everybody, "Guess who wrote me!"
They had a story on the local news that Madonna was coming to visit me.
Madonna has so much power that the guards gave me an extra shower because they thought she was coming to visit me.
I had guards walking me downstairs, everything, trying to peep a look.
- Did she come?
No, I' m glad.
- But you got the extra shower?
- Hey, I got the shower.
The person that supported me the most was my mother.
When my mother got clean, we got real close again.
I don' t blame her for anything.
My mom' s the bomb, you know.
The world' s best mom.
"Dear Mama" is the song I wrote for my mother.
But it' s also for all the mothers.
I' m proud of that.
It affected a lot of people.
It was from Me Against the World, which was completed before I went to jail.
It was the number one record.
My career highs.
It was a trip in jail.
They' d say stuff like, "You' re in jail.
Won' t be any rapping for a long time. "
I' d be like, "My album is number one in the country.
"It just beat Bruce Springsteen."
And they' d be like, "Go back to your cell."
I used to get Entertainment Weekly and see where my record was and just trip out and be like, "Number one in the whole country."
To me, it will always be my favorite, and jail made me wanna dig deeper.
It took five bullets for me to see what was really going on.
like everything is not so important.
You know, you try not to take it personal.
Because you' re talking to killers.
They say something you don' t like, you can' t say, "What?"
You gotta be like, "OK, look man, would you mind not calling me...?"
Anger management like a mother.
In jail, I tried not to have negative feelings towards nobody.
It' s not like I wanted to get out and go shoot somebody up.
People said, "You softened up."
Ain' t nothing soft.
Nothing changed.
If anything, my mentality was like, "Trust nobody.
"Trust nobody."
It' s not like I' m untouchable.
I could be killed as soon as I get out.
I just thought, "I already took five bullets,
"and if I can help it, I don' t plan on taking more."
Rapper, actor and convict, Tupac Shakur, walked out of jail last week, bailed out to the tune of $1. 4 million by Suge Knight of Death Row Records, which signed Shakur to a deal.
My closest friends did me in.
My closest friends, my homeys.
Iooked out for them, put them in the game, turned on me.
So I just thought, "How could I make them sorry they ever did this to me?
"How can I come back, like, 50 times stronger and better?"
Fear is stronger than love.
Remember that.
Fear is stronger than love.
The love I gave meant nothing when it came to fear.
No question, sign with Death Row.
Suddenly, I was out on bail, pending appeal.
I would' ve done 11 months for nothing.
You see that, judge?
Probation people, I didn' t curse.
Give me my props.
Let me stay free.
I was relieved, happy to be home.
I wanted to drive up and down Sunset because I love L. A. with a passion.
I love Sunset, everything about L. A.
Can I get tatted up real quick?
I want a crown here.
You know, the energy, that' s L. A.
- I' m saying, we on Venice Beach.
It' s what you do.
I' ve been in jail 11 months, Tabitha.
You' re supposed to put "I love you".
You got to let me get a look at something.
It' s a trip when last week you were in a cell, and then, next week, I' m up at Monty' s with Cristal champagne and filet mignon and lobster and shrimps.
Everybody went, "Let me take you out.
You' re home?
Let me take you to this! "
We was all up in Roscoe' s.
I even celebrated at El Pollo Loco because I was dreaming about El Pollo Loco the whole time.
Then I went straight to the studio.
And I did 24 tracks in less than two weeks.
You can mix it later and have niggas that love being in the studio just add the drumbeat and shit.
You can do that after the rappers leave.
That' s when it' s fresh.
Get that beat popping, throw them niggas on the track, put it down.
Everybody will listen, be like, "This is the hook."
We' il go lay the hook.
Plus, I had so much to say, I figured this was the best way to vent, instead of paying some psychotherapist $50 million.
I went in the studio.
It was cheaper.
California, get up!
You gotta realize one thing:
Tupac is Death Row.
I feel I have more than just a business relationship with him.
He can be like a brother, a friend.
I like everyone on the record company.
I like Suge, Snoop and Dre.
I hang out with them anyway, now it' s official.
This is Tupac and Dr. Dre, and this is the Week in Rock!
- Week in Rock, baby!
- Week in Rock, baby!
I came out, I was like, "Dre, I want some beats right now."
He' s like, "I' m working on 'California Love'."
I said, "You know you owe me this.
"I' m new on Death Row, fresh out of jail.
"You ain' t gonna be finishing your album soon."
I love collaborating with creative people that' s as talented as' Pac.
He got right in and wrote his lyrics while he was behind the mike and dropped it, and it' s funky.
Me coming to Death Row, for another reason was Snoop.
Please welcome America' s Most Wanted,
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Tupac.
The man got so much style.
Ya' il know we down with this rock thing, nine- six flavor, Death Row.
But who knew it would last, this West Side staff?
Yep, yep, yep.
This is me and Snoop, "2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted", the bomb track.
It' s the first single.
It' s gonna be like the anthem of West Coast rap.
This is gonna shake the whole music scene, guaranteed.
Me and Snoop represent the nucleus of the entire ghetto.
Snoop represents the more calm, all legit, by the book, no waves, let' s get our business handled.
I represent the hard- core, no- holds - barred, no- prisoners, relentless thug.
We both represent both sides of the game.
The calm one and the relentless one.
Here' s my commercial for Death Row.
If you come to Death Row, you will see your art brought to a bigger plateau, and you will be paid one of these days.
Death Row.
Count with me.
Count with me.
This is for my homeboys in jail.
These are 100s.
And they ain' t counterfeit.
If I said it was the money, the struggle continues.
I got money, but I have to pay everybody even more money.
I owe money to Death Row.
So it' s not just, "Oh, he' s paid.
He' s living large. "It' s not like that.
People wanna sue you, and I have to settle for this and that when I know I didn' t do anything, just because it' s like:
"I don' t wanna go to court another eight months." Makes you work harder.
Next year, Death Row is gonna print our own money.
We make so much, we need to start printing our own.
It' s gonna be me and Suge on the $100 bill.
Me, Suge and Damu gonna be on the $100 bill.
I felt I' m getting pimped.
This is the $100 bill on Death Row money, here.
But you have to come up, start from the bottom and work up to the top.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome acclaimed rap artist and Grammy nominee, Tupac.
People fail to realize this is not just play.
I work.
Scatter, scatter!
Drag K off the stage.
Y' all come on, man.
Do it for real, man.
One, two, three.
When it' s time to get down and do my business, I' m going to.
I can' t get no blood on the set?
Shit.
I believe I' m more responsible, more mature and more focused.
When I was in jail, I couldn' t remember why I was rapping.
But I was away from it so long, I said, "I really like going to the studio.
"I really like creating."
I like music, and I like acting.
I like doing it.
She' s a super freak, super freak She' s super- freaky
I can be whoever because I' m true to me.
The reason I sell six million records, the reason I can go to jail and come out without a scratch, the reason I am who I am is because I can look into my face and find my soul.
It' s there.
I didn' t sell it.
I thought, "I' m a superpower.
"Let' s combine superpowers and ally."
Damu!
My dog' s going crazy, ready to kill a few people.
- Yeah.
- He wanna kill.
I love my artists.
I don' t consider my people artists.
I consider them family.
We' d still travel together.
If they needed something, what' s mine will still be theirs.
It' s no situation where I' m dealing with them strictly for business, because they' re good.
It' s not like that.
You' ve gotta have more respect for your people.
Plus we' ve got a Death Row East going on.
- I' m sure you heard about that.
- Tell me about that.
Hold on.
Damu, sit!
But Death Row has a reputation for having a thug- like mentality.
Won' t that get you in trouble?
Death Row has a bigger reputation for success than anything else.
The reason for all of the fear involves the world of this man, the man getting out of the limousine.
Six- foot- three, 335- pound Marion Knight, known by the nickname of "Suge", short for "Sugar".
It' s an efficient camp over here, professional, business- oriented.
Suge Knight has managed to become the head of a $100 million record company and one of the most powerful and feared men in the music industry.
The controversy over Death Row Records and its owner being sort of a gangster.
Everybody' s asking about Death Row.
- Suge ain' t no gangsta.
He' s chilling.
No, man, Suge a rider.
I know what good morals are, but you' re supposed to disregard good morals when you' re living in a crazy, bad world.
If you' re in hell, how can you live like an angel?
You' re surrounded by devils, trying to be an angel?
That' s like suicide.
I' d like to tell Tupac to keep his guards up.
One other thing I' d like to say, any artist out there that want to be an artist and wants to stay a star and don' t wanna have to worry about the executive producer trying to be all in the videos, all on the records, dancing, come to Death Row.
When I got out of jail, the West Coast - East Coast shit was really starting.
Wait, the East Coast don' t love Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg?
The East Coast ain' t got no love for Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg and Death Row?
West Coast was Death Row.
The East Coast was Bad Boy.
Check this out.
I' m the executive producer that a comment was made about earlier.
Everybody thought it was a war, a war for record sales and attention.
But to me it was personal.
I love the East Coast.
I' m from the East Coast.
But I felt like Puffy and Biggie wanted to dirty up everything I worked for.
So it made me come back more relentless.
I' m mad at Biggie.
I' m rushing the nigga.
Yo, Piggie, man, we got it going on, baby.
It' s on and cracking, man.
He' s gone, baby.
So I directed videos.
'Pac, you alive?
I mean, you safe?
Man, I' m so happy you' re free.
Happy to see you, lying piece of shit.
'Pac, please don' t kill me.
It was Buff' s idea.
- No, man.
Please don' t take me out of the game.
I ain' t going to kill you.
We was homeboys once, Pig.
Once we homeboys, we always homeboys, even if you is a fat phony.
And I did a song with Faith, Biggie' s wife.
Faith' s my homegirl.
I just want to send a shout- out to Faith.
Then I did "Hit 'Em Up".
Which is a classic battle record.
Everything happened so fast at that point.
I was looking at things, the East Coast- West Coast thing, it just got out of control.
Dudes was getting killed, and I felt responsible.
But I couldn' t stop it.
We ain' t mad at the whole New York, just certain people.
I got this project coming out along with some brothers called One Nation.
It' s like an East Coast- West Coast collaboration to kill this whole new vibe.
Everybody want it to be a war between the East Coast and West Coast.
It' s really a problem with two rappers.
The East Coast- West Coast thing is something journalists are making up to get paid off, so it can drag out and everybody can have albums.
They perpetuate this, so it can be drama.
When it go down, don' t look at me and Biggie and be like, "Why is there a big East Coast/ West Coast war?"
When you' re shooting this to 3, 300 homes, 300 countries, telling them about a war that they would never know exists.
That' s where information becomes a problem.
We both need to exercise greater restraint.
Damn, sometimes life gets messed up.
When I was on Death Row, I was successful but not happy.
Tupac, your life has been marred by considerable pain.
Do you think you' il get to the point where you can live a normal life?
No.
But, I...
I have to make the life that I do live as happy as I can and try to do the best with what I have.
Live the best life I can live, be as happy as I can be.
Nothing is perfect for anybody, I don' t think.
I felt trapped.
They say, "You made your bed, lay in it"?
I tried to move.
I can' t move to no other bed.
I felt I can' t live a different lifestyle.
This the life they gave me, this the life I made.
I felt I can' t change, not for the courts, not for the parole board, not for nobody.
This is it.
I also felt like something was gonna happen to me because I' m paranoid.
And I put it in my videos.
That nigga ain' t want none.
I been drinking.
No, no, no, where he at?
Yo, watch out.
It was a prophecy.
I had a prophecy about my death.
That' s why I go in the studio and do three songs a day, get things ready.
We don' t have time or the luxury to spend all of this time doing one song.
We don' t have it.
If I die, it can happen.
If anything were to happen to me, that album' s ready to go.
So it' s all good.
I felt as if the only thing that can kill me is death, and even then my music will live forever.
Tupac, Suge and others jumped Anderson, punching and kicking him.
Terrified bystanders scattered as the group streamed into the casino then out into the street.
Whoa.
Shakur, with record company executive, Suge Knight, headed for a club.
While stopping at this intersection a car with four people pulled up and fired on Shakur and Knight.
Shakur was shot several times in the chest.
The driver, his record producer, was grazed in the head.
He' s returned to intensive care after another surgery, still in critical condition.
All week long fans of Tupac have gathered outside the hospital.
He' s undergone two operations.
His right lung was removed.
He' s intermittently conscious.
Jesse Jackson' s been here.
Family is keeping vigil.
Despite reports that his wounds were not life- threatening, people at the hospital continue to tell us he is in very serious condition.
Who shot me?
Shit, I don' t know.
Sorry.
My death, it' s a tragedy like Shakespeare, I guess.
But I have no bad feelings.
I have love for everybody.
Please welcome the mothers of Biggie Smalls and Tupac Shakur,
Afeni Shakur and Voletta Wallace.
Coming to grips with my past, it was hard.
I don' t feel what I did was evil.
I feel like the way I was living and my mentality was a part of my progression to be a man.
But we grow.
We all grow.
We' re made to grow.
You either evolve, or you disappear.
I don' t want to be forgotten.
I' il always be a troublemaker to some people.
But I still get love from my community.
I owe them everything.
That' s why I owe everything to the 'hood.
I' ve got love there.
I' ve got love from thugs and the street dudes.
lay out the real mat on the world and how it is.
The message is, young black males could do anything if you just give us a shot, stop trying to beat us down.
And to my homeboys, we need to be in control of ourselves.
I' m not saying I' il change the world, but I guarantee I' il spark the brain that will change the world.
So keep your head up.
Do what you' ve gotta do.
And then inside of you, I' il be reborn.
Armed horsemen:
Over there:
What is so important that you interrupt us?
Prince Frederick of Saxony.
He refuses to surrender Luther to you, Your Holiness.
Go, go:
O Lond. and judge tly cause.
A wild boan las invaded tly vineyand.
We can no longen suffen tle senpent to cneep tlnougl tle field of tle Lond.
Tle books of Mantin Lutlen ane to be exammined and bunned.
Anyone wlo pnesummes to infninge oun excommmmunication and anatlemma will stand unden tle wnatl of Almmiglty God and tle Apostles Peten and Paul.
Amen.
You can burn his books, but you can' t burn his ideas:
Go back to Rome, you butchers:
Go burn your own books:
Go burn the Pope' s books:
Papist devils, leave us:
By order of His Holiness, Pope Leo X... the works of Martin Luther shall be erased from the memory of man:
Martin Luther speaks the truth:
- Here, Father:
Find someone else to do it:
He belongs to us:
This... is what Rome calls a Papal Bull, an edict from the Pope himself.
There' s only one thing to do with this blast of wind.
Feed the fire with canon law:
Feed the fire with every lie ever written in Rome:
- Feed the flames:
Feed it:
That' s right, feed the flames:
Feed them:
My Emperor.
My good uncle.
Allow me to extend my congratulations on your elevation.
I' ve come to speak to you about Martin Luther.
Our Holy Father has sent his new cardinal to advise us.
Oh:
You mean you' ve traveled all the way from Rome just in order to advise us about this small matter?
Heresy is never a small matter, my lord.
Your Highness, if I might for a moment have your ear.
- If your business is Martin Luther...
- My business is Saxony, sir...... and I wish a brief audience with my Emperor.
- Deliver Luther to Rome.
- I cannot.
He' s my subject.
It' s my duty to see that he gets a fair hearing.
Aleander has given me his word that the Inquisition will give Luther a proper hearing.
The Rome Inquisition does not give hearings, my lord.
It gives death sentences.
And the whole of Germany prays that you will defend her.
The heretic must be tried.
Your blessed grandfather Maximilian told us that no German subject would ever be condemned without a fair trial in his own country.
In Worms.
Worms is still a very long way from Wittenberg, my lord, and the Pope himself has put a bounty on Luther' s head.
His spies are everywhere, in defiance of my humble rule, and therefore, sir, in defiance of your greater rule.
Then I will ensure Martin Luther' s safe conduct to a fair hearing.
On that you have my word.
Oh, yes.
Martin Luther is coming:
Bless us, Father:
Please bless us:
Give us your blessing:
Don' t kneel to me.
Bless me, Father:
Bless me, Father:
I thought you had abandoned me.
I thought I was alone again in this world.
Be still, Martin.
One slip, and you' il save the Emperor a trial.
I' m here to serve you.
I jest because I' m so afraid.
Martin, I hoped you' d help reform the church, not destroy it.
With all its sins, the church is still the church.
What is a child without its family?
How would people fare left to themselves, helpless and frightened?
All my life, I have seen a world that hates evil more than it loves good.
I beg you to look to the good, Martin.
You are tearing the world apart.
That day when you sent me out so boldly to change the world...
Did you really think there wouldn' t be a cost?
It is simply a matter of individual conscience.
They' il burn him for sure.
Do you, Martin Luther, recognize these books?
A Senmmon on Indulgence and Gnace.
Tle Babylonian Captivity.
Fneedomm of a Clnistian.
Addness to tle Clnistian Nobility of tle Genmman Nation?
Are you the author?
All are mine.
These books contain heresies against our holy church.
Do you recant what you' ve written?
I...
Please, God, let him say the right thing.
- Speak up.
May I have time to consider?
You have had the time, and you should have been prepared to answer.
I would like to answer satisfactorily, without injury to the divine word or danger to my soul.
Any one of us might be expected to bear witness, unequivocally and fearlessly at any time.
All the more in your case, a famous, experienced professor of theology.
We grant you one day.
Tomorrow you shall answer.
Damn you, go back to hell:
Damn you, damn you, damn you:
Damn you, go back to hell:
Shut up, shut up, shut up:
I feel your foul breath on my neck:
Happy devil you are, to see me mute:
Shaking... shaking like an animal at the slaughter:
Well, where is his faith now?
Where' s his faith now?
Where' s his boasting now?
Where' s his boasting...?
Save me.
I am yours.
Save me.
I am yours.
Save me.
Speak well, Doctor.
Good luck, Martin.
- Good luck.
- Good luck, Martin.
- God be with you.
- I pray Thee do Thy will.
Order in the hall.
Order:
Order:
Martin Luther, are you the author of these writings?
I am.
Do you recant what you have written here?
I cannot renounce all of my works because they are not all the same.
First are those books in which
I have described Christian faith and life so simply that even my opponents have admitted that these works are useful.
To renounce these writings would be unthinkable, for that would be to renounce accepted Christian truths.
He is not here to make speeches, only to answer.
The second group of my work is directed against the foul doctrine and evil living of the Popes, past and present.
- No:
- Yes:
Through the laws of the Pope and the doctrines of men, the consciences of the faithful have been miserably vexed and flayed.
I will do nothing but add strength to tyranny and open not just the windows but also the doors to this great ungodliness.
He has condemned himself.
In the third group,
I have written against private persons and individuals who uphold Roman tyranny and have attacked my own efforts to encourage piety to Christ.
I confess... that I have written too harshly.
I am but a man and I can err.
Only let my errors be proven by Scripture...
and I will revoke my work and throw my books into the fire.
You have not answered the question.
You, Martin Luther, will not draw into doubt those things which the Catholic church has judged already, things that have passed into usage, rite, and observance... the faith that Christ, the most perfect Lawgiver, ordained, the faith the martyrs strengthened with their blood.
You wait in vain for a disputation over things that you are obligated to believe.
Now give your answer.
Yes or no?
Will you recant or will you not?
Since Your Majesty and Your Lordships desire a simple reply...
I will answer.
Unless I am convinced by Scripture and by plain reason... and not by Popes and councils who have so often contradicted themselves... my conscience is captive to the word of God.
To go against conscience is neither right nor safe.
I cannot... and I will not recant.
Here I stand.
I can do no other.
God help me.
Yes, Martin:
- The man' s a heretic:
- He' s a prophet of God:
Order:
Young Martin walks out:
You have your answer:
Order:
Order:
Order:
- Luther:
- No, it' s not that simple.
- Luther:... the word of God:
Luther:
God bless you, Martin:
Make way:
I am descended from a line of Christian emperors.
You will not make a heretic of me.
He has condemned himself, Excellency.
He must be stopped before he infects all of Germany.
My lord, you gave Luther the promise of a safe conduct.
Luther' s not a man but a demon, clothed in his religious habit, the better to deceive us.
Martin Luther' s your subject.
What do you say?
He is too daring for me, my lord.
Although not, it seems, for the people.
If anything should happen to him on the way back... so be it.
Thank you:
God bless your journey home, Brother Martin:
You' il always be in our hearts, Martin:
Truth will out, Brother Martin:
God be with you:
Why are they leaving us?
Wait.
Martin.
Martin Luther, step down and your comrade will be spared.
I' m Luther.
Ulrick, no:
I am Luther.
Spalatin:
Sorry about the rough ride.
Prince Frederick was keen to nab you before someone else did.
Tley mmay lave mmundened Lutlen. but they will not stop what we have started.
The holy war has just begun:
Any man who holds himself up as the master of others, whether he be prince, Pope, priest, even professor, must repent... must repent or be cut down:
You call me Professor Carlstadt.
No more:
From this day forward, I am Brother Andreas.
Yes.
And all of you, likewise, prepare yourselves for the great leveling:
Yes:
"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image."
Learn to despise props and pretensions.
Stand with the righteous, or be cut down with the others.
There is no middle ground:
Teach us:
Martin would never have shamed a student for wearing a crucifix:
I know Martin Luther.
I discovered him.
He said reform.
You want revolt:
If you haven' t got the stomach to finish what he started, Melanchthon, step aside.
Why are you babbling in riddles?
Beware, or you too shall be cut down.
What?
I asked for a Greek New Testament.
I need proper books, not this rubbish.
And a Greek- German dictionary.
Leave us.
And a Greek- Latin dictionary.
This is not the time, Martin.
Well, the Emperor' s going to burn me, anyway.
He' il burn us all.
This is treason.
To have a New Testament in German, in words ordinary people can understand?
Yes:
It' s the thing Rome fears most.
Well, you must blame the Author for that.
The wall... break it down:
Make breaches:
No priests:
This cursed house... pull her down:
Come out, you...
- Just give us our rights:
Blasphemers:
We must send in soldiers.
And cause more bloodshed?
If Wittenberg cannot settle its religious problems without that, then the rest of the world will not be impressed.
Send for Luther.
How' s the work?
Tricky.
Words are like children... the more care you lavish on them, the more they demand.
Rather like women.
I wouldn' t know.
Take this verse in Saint Luke...
"It is the father' s will that nothing be lost."
In our language, the word "will" denotes strength, willpower, bending someone to your will.
But in the original Greek, this three- letter word denotes passion, fire, inner organs.
It can mean beloved, desire, even sexual desire.
Eat your porridge.
You' re not even listening.
Besides, porridge does nothing for my bowels.
No, it' s not the word that' s important, but what it' s saying about God.
You are too much alone here.
Oh, very good, Spalatin.
Two weeks since you last came.
Of course I' m too much alone:
How can I write for our people when I don' t live among them?
The language of the Bible should be like a mother talking to her children.
Well, it' s decided,
Martin Luther must not leave this room.
But Knight George... may.
It' s time you saw for yourself, Martin.
Why?
Why were they killed?
No reason.
Just happened to be in the wrong place, got in the way of a mob of peasants looting a monastery.
The whole world' s been turned upside- down by that madman Luther.
And him saying that every Christian has the right to take what they need by force.
Well, Luther' s gone, but his damned ideas have set the whole earth on fire.
Soon this country will be blazing.
Let me go in the name of God:
Take off your Roman dresses or have them burnt off:
Cowards:
Cowards:
How dare you?
You call yourselves Christians?
Christians?:
You, why are you standing there?
Put out this fire:
Shovels:
When a limb is rotten, you must cut it off.
- You know that as well as I.
- Get out:
Martin, this is for you:
Let it burn:
Get out of Wittenberg before I beat you out:
Beat me out?
I defended you.
I supported you.
I' m carrying on just as you would have.
You think this is my work?
This is never my work:
No, it' s the people' s work:
The people' s work:
It' s the people' s work.
Spalatin.
Are you there?
Now, how is he?
Luther' s depressed, my lord.
Confused.
He feels the peasants have twisted his language.
But he will join them?
Luther abhors violence.
But he' s in sympathy with their grievances?
It' s hard to argue against freeing people from crippling taxes or the purgatory of being born slaves all their lives.
You know, if Luther were to lift one finger, every peasant in Germany would rise up behind him.
Maybe.
Luther' s a theologian, my lord.
He fights, but with his tongue or his pen.
He will not dnaw tle swond.
I lave finally tonn tle wonld apant.
I unged tle pninces to action. and low tley lave answened mmy call:
I said tlese nebels wene outside God' s law. tlat notling on eantl is mmone poisonous.
On devilisl tlan a nebel. tlat tley mmust be stopped by eveny mmeans possible.
And yet tle blood tley sled is as notling commpaned to tlis slauglten
I lave unleasled.
You don' t want to go in there, sir.
It' s over.
It' s over.
How many?
No one knows yet.
How many?
Some 100.
100, 000... dead peasants.
There were knights among them.
That' s a plague, Spalatin.
That' s butchery.
Have a care, Martin.
You may need these butchers.
Grete.
We are seeking Dr. Luther.
My sisters and I escaped three days ago from the convent at Nimbschen.
And... you still came here?
Because this is where Dr. Luther lives.
Sir, we were smuggled out in these herring barrels.
We' ve been two nights on an open wagon, have had no rest, no food, no sleep.
So if you could just tell me...
I...
I' m Luther.
Katharina von Bora.
Martin Luther.
But you know that already.
I' il take you to a shelter.
Who' s there?
No.
Martin Luther?
My lord.
We meet at last.
I dedicated this work to you, my lord.
The translation of the New Testament... into our own language.
Into German?
But this will separate us from Rome... forever.
I have always sought Christian unity, but not at the price of servitude.
I answer to God' s law, not Roman.
Roman law is the reality.
I believe in the reality of Christ.
With no compromises?
None.
You realize, of course, they' il take this to be an act of sheer provocation.
Yes.
And they will not hesitate to strike back.
Yes, I know.
Well, so long as you know.
Do you think I could have my present now?
Yes, of course.
Take my heart
And never worry
Evil tongues will mock
We' il mock in turn
For my heart is my gift to thee
Never worry
Stay, Ulrick, stay.
Please.
Marry one of these lovely young women.
I know there' s at least one left.
I' il bring God' s word to my homeland.
No, this is not a good time.
No prince can protect you there.
I want the Dutch people to know what I experienced when I read His word for the first time.
Then God be with you.
And with you, Martin.
You left so quickly, I feared it was my singing.
If only it were.
Look at him.
He goes to his fate, hurrying like a bridegroom.
Not all bridegrooms are so fleet.
I would not say the bachelors of Wittenberg have been tardy.
True.
The other nuns are all spoken for.
And you' ve made it so clear that marriage is an honorable estate... for everyone else, at least.
- I see why you scare them.
- My grief is that I scare you.
I know you like me, Doctor.
I feel your heart when we make music together.
But when the music ends, you flee.
I' m a man of blood, Katie.
I divide people.
Thousands have died because of me.
Most days I' m so depressed I can' t even get out of bed.
But I' m not.
I' m a wandering planet.
No one should look to me for guidance.
Two things I promise you... we will make joyous music together, and to get to you, your enemies will have to step across my dead body.
In return, I ask only one thing... that you bring none of them to our marriage bed, not peasants or princes or Popes, unless He be a God of love.
For God' s sake, at least get new candles:
- There' s nothing left except these.
- Now:
So mmucl fon Leo wlo would nebuild Romme...
800. 000 ducats in debt.
Le would lave sold tle Vatican itself.
But as a Pope, he could have changed the world.
He could have reformed the church instead of just rebuilding it.
Leo was a spiritual dwarf when we needed a giant like Luther.
Well, Luther' s getting married.
To a runaway nun.
He wouldn' t dare.
If I wene to tell you tlat
Albent of Mainz sent us a wedding pnesent. wlat would you say?
Send it back.
Then it' s as well he did no such thing, or we' d be having our first quarrel.
Martin.
They caught him at the border.
What is it?
What has happened?
The Emperor summons our princes to Augsburg.
Why?
To finish what he began at Worms.
You mustn' t go.
They' il fry you like a suckling pig.
If you die, everything you stand for dies with you.
All right, what will you say?
How will you make them change their minds?
- I don' t know.
- Well, I need to know:
Katie, first they wanted me to recant.
Now they want half of Europe to bow the knee.
We must fight:
Let somebody else fight.
Let somebody else be roasted like a pig:
All I want is Luther.
Break the princes, and you break Luther.
Their tactics will be to delay, to bog the process down in detail.
Luther' s hymns.
They are.
You must keep the issues simple, Excellency.
They must accept there is only one church.
This plague just goes on spreading.
I should have burned him:
My pninces.
Bnotlens in Clnist. tlis isn' t a timme fon caution. but fon boldness.
Dn.
Lutlen.
He las lummbled Fnance and sacked Romme itself.
Only the Turk remains a threat to him.
In a word, he has all the time and resource in the world to reduce us to a powder piece by piece, state by state.
And I think he means to do it.
My lords... silence will not save us.
If we challenge Charles, will there be war... the awful shedding of yet more blood?
I' ve mislaid all my former certainties.
But think.
The Emperor invites us to present our creeds, to present what we believe in.
Satan invites us to preach in hell.
Is that a trap?
Or our greatest opportunity so far?
And remember, since I may not come with you to Augsburg, you' il face Charles' rough alone.
Your choice is simple.
If you give in, my lords, the bright comet that is our faith will shatter and be reduced to a few isolated torches, sputtering in a dark universe.
This way:
And why does the father run to meet his prodigal son?
Landowners don' t run.
Noblemen don' t run.
Princes don' t run.
So why does this rich, landowning father run?
Because he' s afraid.
He' s so afraid that his son will run back to the filthy pig farm.
He runs because he loves his son.
And there' s a special word for this love.
Compassion.
Compassion.
And you know what this word means?
It' s just a church bell, Martin, ringing the Angelus.
Continue the story.
Beloved princes of the Empire,
I will be brief and to the point.
Your ministers shall not preach, and you will outlaw these Bibles in the common language and declare anyone who possesses one an enemy of the state.
We will not stop our ministers from preaching the word, here or anywhere else.
Do not concede, my lord.
We will not outlaw the new Bible, my lord.
As a sign of your loyalty to me, tomorrow you shall all march in the Corpus Christi procession to the cathedral and worship, all of you, in the Roman manner.
We will not, my lord.
You will:
Or you shall know my sword:
Before I let anyone take from me the word of God and ask me to deny my belief,
I will kneel and let him strike off my head.
Your Highness, we have drawn up a confession of our faith which I believe you will find blameless.
I am so very happy to have been loved by you...
Katharina von Bora.
Martin:
We did it, Martin:
We did it:
The Emperor allowed us to read our confession of faith:
The princes stood up to him:
He had to listen:
They can' t stop us now, Martin:
A million and a half people ride the El trains every day.
Over 20 years, I' ve written wills for about 8. 000 of 'em.
Figured out which kid gets the painting over the fireplace, which one gets the antique spoon collection.
Last thanks, parting shots, confessions...
People try to fit it all in.
And once I' ve finished, another life has been summed up - assets and debts tallied, then zeroed out.
You initial here and there, you sign at the bottom... then, If you' re like most clients, you look up, smile, and you ask the question I' ve heard for 20 years:
"Is that it, then?"
"The rest is up to you."
Beautiful.
All right, make a wish.
I just have to take this call.
- Did you win?
- "Take this call"?
- She' s 14.
- Jen, not now.
Now' s not the time.
Remind me, why was it we agreed to give her the phone?
- Emergencies.
- Which this is, by the way.
Come on.
- All right!
- Come on, get off.
Bye.
All right, everyone, are we all happy now?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- What do you mean?
Oh, I just had such a hard time getting you a present.
I love this bathrobe.
I think the problem is that you never really want anything.
- That' s true.
- What you gave me tonight.
Evan coming home, everyone' s at dinner, that cake you make...
Yes!
That' s it!
Good night, Mary.
I left the Anderson will on your desk.
Night, Bill.
Sedgwick.
I' m home.
There' s a female bonding ritual going on in the den.
- What are they doing in there?
Tattooing "I love Satan" on their foreheads, piercing their bellybuttons, stuff like that.
What did you say about that?
- I said, "Don' t get any blood on the couch."
She' s too beautiful.
That' s your fault.
- Here, sign this.
- What is it?
- Oh, God, thank you.
- How was your workout?
- Same.
How are you?
You know, ordering the spring line at the store, yada- yada.
- I thought you just got here.
Yeah, but it' s the fundraiser at Jen' s school.
So your dinner' s in the oven and the girls have already eaten.
Can we go see a movie sometime?
Or at least we could look at the ads in the paper together.
How are you doing?
Fine.
Check on them now and then, OK?
Don' t wait up.
Get out of here, Dad!
Bev?
It' s not true that I don' t want anything.
Bev?
Doors open on the right.
- Excuse me.
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
You know what?
I' m gonna just go up.
Oh, my God.
That was a great class.
Come on.
- Are we goin 'up, or what?
- I' m just trying to...
Here.
- OK, don' t do that.
- Do what?
Stand there looking dumb.
It' s just not cute in a guy your age.
Be a doll and help me carry my clothes.
And stop lookin 'at my ass.
T...
T...
T...
Oh!
Uh...
Paulina, could you help?
Excuse me.
May I help you?
The sign said "Feel free to watch."
Are you here for lessons?
Yes.
- Mr...?
- Clark.
Are you registering as a couple or as a single?
I mean, not that I' m...
Yeah, just me.
If you buy six at a time, the price per class drops $5.
- Have you ever danced before?
No.
But I' m a fast learner.
We' re starting a new intro ballroom series for singles.
I recommend that beginners start with that.
There' s still room in the class.
All right.
Thank you.
- Mr. Clark?
Where are you going?
The class starts tonight.
Tonight?
Oh, right, yeah.
We' il begin shortly.
Hey.
I' m Vern.
John.
- You beginning ballroom?
- Yeah, looks that way.
- Chic.
So, you dance much?
"Stairway to Heaven."
- You?
I didn' t go.
Anybody see any girls?
I mean, I' m here for the babes, right.
I mean, it can' t be just us, can it?
No offense, sir.
None taken.
Hi.
See the slinky one with the eyebrows?
That' s me - if you don' t mind.
I know you won' t mind.
- All right.
Work the goods.
Here they come.
Come to Papa.
Ouch.
Memories of high school, huh, boys?
Good evening, gentlemen, and welcome to the beginner' s ballroom class.
My name is Miss Mitzi.
I am the owner of this dancing establishment, and I am going to be your teacher.
Disappointed that I' m older?
I mean...
Forward, side, closed...
Very good, Chic.
- Whoa!
- Yes.
- Easy.
Remember to use the balls of your feet.
Where is your right foot?
- It' s right back there.
It hasn' t moved, has it?
Not yet.
- Well, now would be a good time.
Close.
Excellent.
Forward, side, close.
One, two, three, rise.
- Hey, hey, hey!
- You guys saw that?
Excellent, gentlemen.
Keep your sticks up.
- And...
- Counter- promenade.
Let me see what you' re doing.
Ah!
- God!
- Put the stick down.
We' re not gonna play with these sticks anymore if you boys won' t behave.
Heel, toe, toe- toe, toe, heel, toe- toe.
When we go forward, is it heel- toe or toe...
So it' s back...
Harder than it looks, isn' t it, gentlemen?
Well, you' ve all done very very well for your first lesson.
I' m gonna give you a little incentive to keep on dancing.
Paulina?
Would you and Francesco mind giving our new students a little demonstration?
Certainly, Miss Mitzi.
Daphne?
Thank you, Paulina.
Whoo!
That was beautiful.
- You all right?
- Yeah, I' m good.
I' m comin '.
How lucky for us.
- Where are we goin '?
Anyway.
Don' t go to Jim' s.
They got a bad roach problem there around the corner.
You' re gonna go anywhere after class, you come here, OK?
Thank you.
Why' d you guys decide to take dance, anyway?
- I' m gettin 'married in September.
- Nice.
My bride said she' d like to see me lose a few pounds.
I said it won' t.
- I think you' il win that argument.
- I' m taking classes to impress the ladies.
You know what they say about guys who can dance, right?
- That they' re great in bed.
- Yeah, baby.
- Where do you get that stupid crap?
What do you think?
Everybody knows a guy who can move on the dance floor can move in the sack.
Most guys, they can' t dance at all.
Guys who can, they get their pick of the litter.
That' s why, when I' m done with this class, babes will drop at my feet.
They' re gonna be droppin 'dead at your feet.
When you took your shoes off in class today, I had to run to the window for air.
What kind of person says something like that to somebody they don' t even know?
Hey, man, I' m doin 'you a favor.
I' m telling you something obnoxious about yourself that you might not be aware of.
If there' s something obnoxious about me that you don' t think I' m aware of, y' all should feel free to say something about it to me.
Shooting fish in a barrel.
- Where are all the ladies, anyways?
- I don' t know what I' m talking about.
Only reason I go there is she lets me rehearse whenever I want for free.
Soon as I find a partner.
How?
Leaves you as the only one here who hasn' t said why he' s dancing yet.
Well, I' m dancing for exercise, like Vern.
Bull.
Because I' m lousy in bed, like Chic.
- That is bull!
I didn' t say I was bad in bed.
Come on, why?
Is there any pepper here?
Could I have some?
That' s what I thought.
She was a Blackpool finalist, you know.
Who?
The princess.
The other teacher, Paulina.
What' s Blackpool?
She was there last year with her partner - who they say was much more to her than just her partner.
That' s the only reason she came back here to teach - mad at the world, boo- hoo- hoo and all that.
- Why' d he dump her?
- Yeah.
How the hell should I know?
Golly!
Hello?
Great.
Great, Vern.
The mambo is slow.
Slide that hand one inch south of the equator... and I will bust you on your ass, twinkle- toes.
I don' t like the tropics any more than you do, OK?
And basic.
And cross over.
Right.
One more time, and walk around.
- And basic.
- Watch out.
And big ending.
Look at you, John!
- You were really good.
I' m gonna go up and change.
Right.
- Dad work late tonight?
- Yeah, looks that way.
Guess whatever he' s working on, he must like it.
- Why do you say that?
- He seems happier lately.
Does he?
We' re gonna have trouble getting more stock in.
Everything' s on back- order.
Look, Carolyn, I' m gonna need you to go to New York and sweet- talk them.
- Can you leave tomorrow?
- No.
Why not?
My husband is having an affair.
How do you know that?
He was whispering.
What was he whispering?
I was so scared I hung up before I could hear anything.
Well, there' s lots of other reasons why he could be whispering.
I mean, maybe he didn' t wanna wake up the kids.
Huh?
That' s it.
Take a breath, go get yourself a brownie in the kitchen, just chill.
OK.
- Euh!
- Ooh- hoo- hoo!
She' il be divorced by Easter.
Join the warm- up.
Ow!
I' m sorry!
- Watch your floorcraft, spasmo!
What, you think you own this floor?
I' il have a bruise the size of Texas tomorrow!
- Go away!
You go away!
I can' t dance to that crap.
You just gonna stand there and let that fat cow insult you?
- I' m sorry, what did you say?
She didn' t say anything.
These are the teeth I wear for the Latin.
Bam!
Gets the judges right in the eye, catches the light.
And then the make- up - you know the make- up.
"Swish- butt," "Fancy pants," "Pinky boy"...
All these names, all these names I' ve been called ever since I was eight years old... and dancing around to my mother' s rumba records.
You know what the worst of it is?
I' m not gay.
Can you imagine how much easier my life would be if I were?
I got news for you.
Look, you' re not gonna tell anybody in the office, are you?
I wouldn' t do that.
Look, I' m in the same boat, aren' t I?
No, you' re not.
- Why not?
- Because... people like you.
You know what I mean?
You' re charming.
I' m Linky Link.
They would crucify me if they found out.
I' m the sports trivia king, I' m the super sports fan, you know?
- You don' t like football?
- I...
You know.
Run three yards, fall down, pile up.
I mean, you know, four months of that, I' m ready to put a gun to my head.
I fooled everybody.
You know what my dream is?
What?
Under my own name.
For all the world to see.
That' s my dream.
Did I get it all?
It' s Bev.
I was just trying to find John.
Called the office at six and Betsy said that he' d left for the day, and I was just...
You got home by five?
How did you manage that, you lucky dog?
Ah, there' s the door.
OK.
Sorry I' m late.
I got hung up at the office.
- I thought you were shopping with Jenna.
I called the office and Betsy said you left for the day at six.
Yeah, I did - for a sandwich.
Then I came back.
Well, I called your private line a few times, nobody picked up.
That' s because I wasn' t working in my office, I was in Andy' s.
How is Andy?
We' re working on a really big estate plan together.
- So he was there?
- What?
Was Andy there?
Why are you asking me all these questions?
I don' t know.
Anyway, I stopped off for a bite on the way home with Link Peterson.
Interesting guy.
Not what you' d think.
- How was your day?
- Great.
One, two, three, four...
One, two, three...
Mom?
Dad' s acting weird.
He says they' re in love.
He' s moving out Saturday.
He loves those kids.
I thought we were happy.
I didn' t know anything.
I didn' t know.
Oh...
Hi.
I give free consultations during my lunch hour.
You sure you don' t wanna come in?
So he comes home late on Wednesdays, and when he comes home his shirts smell like perfume.
He' s been seen making strange body movements and you feel he has a secret.
- That' s correct.
- Ever think about just asking him?
- Yes, I' ve thought about it...
To the best of people.
And sometimes the thing that happens doesn' t mean anything.
Doesn' t need an investigator, just needs somebody to look the other way for a while.
My husband is a serious man, Mr. Devine.
If he' s having an affair, it is not casual.
All right.
Give me a moment while I call in my associate, Mr. Harcourt.
Scottie!
Scottie Harcourt, this is Mrs. Clark.
She suspects her husband' s up to no good.
To hold him is a job. "
Simone de Beauvoir said that.
It' s very nice to meet you, Mrs. Clark.
Same here.
I think we can start this investigation without too much cost to Mrs. Clark.
Follow that husband around for a few days, take some pictures, see what' s up.
But I have to warn you, if it goes to trial it' s gonna be...
Trial?
In the event of a divorce.
But we don' t know if he' s having an affair.
It' s possible.
Yeah, it' s possible.
It' s possible we could find your husband neck- deep in potpourri, investing things.
Not likely.
Look, this is what we' il do.
We look for the potpourri.
But if we find the potpourri and there' s something big and stinky in the pot, then you and I renegotiate, OK?
That sound good?
OK.
- Hi.
- How you doin '?
- Good.
- Tell what?
Your posture, it' s a dead giveaway.
- You' re kidding.
- No.
- How much you been practicing, anyway?
No.
Five- to- one ratio.
Five hours of practice for every one hour of class.
Doctor Dance has an open dance party every Thursday.
Even you.
Ballroom is all or nothing, John.
I' m draggin 'your ass out of class and onto a real dance floor.
We' il go straight there after work.
- Link?
- Yeah?
Can you really tell?
Yeah.
Having fun?
- What are you doing here?
- Spying.
Excuse me, we were dancing together.
Dude, she does not wanna dance with you.
Now back off.
Hey, you know, I...
Link always insists on dancing with the youngest girls.
Not that those are easy to find.
Once.
He was my dancing partner for 15 years.
- We were husband and wife for 14.
- Wow.
He was my perfect partner.
I' m lucky it even happened once.
Ah!
# And shall you be my new romance?
Do you remember that?
They held hands like this...
Oh, come on, John, let' s try it.
- No.
No, no, no, I can' t.
- Why not?
Come on.
No, I don' t want to...
Let go, John.
That' s it, John.
Whoa!
I wasn' t watching.
How are you?
We' re finished anyway.
- What do you mean?
No offense, but I can' t be your dance partner.
- You' re too much of a freak.
I mean, look at your palms.
Don' t you know you' re supposed to wash your hands after you use that stuff?
Excuse me.
And you' re...
Chic and Vern and...
It' s John.
What would you like to work on tonight?
Well, in my opinion - Chic - I think since we' re beginners, a good idea would be...
Waltz.
Maybe the waltz.
Um...
I' il work with you one at a time and you can be first.
All right.
- I' m sorry.
I' m a reporter.
Plus, she' s not my type.
I like a woman built for comfort, not for speed.
Really?
Why don' t you put the camera down and take me out on the dance floor?
Two reasons:
I' m working and this is not my type of dance.
Well, how do you know if you' ve never tried?
Come on, put the camera down.
Come on, give me a shot.
Oh, dear!
Sorry, sorry!
- I' m sorry.
- It' s gonna stain.
Don' t... worry.
I' il take care of it.
- Would you like to use this?
- Excuse me?
Just to wipe your coat, or...
Please.
Go ahead.
- It' s silly, but it' s my favorite coat.
- I' m sorry.
It' s vintage.
But this part' s real suede, so now it' s ruined.
You sure?
Maybe they can fix that.
No.
I know about stains.
You know, I never understood that.
live cows get dirty all the time, they don' t get stained.
All that leather stands in the mud, nothing happens.
Go figure.
What is that?
Get a little sauce on your coat and look.
- Why is that?
- I don' t know.
We' il have to ask the next cow that comes by.
Wow.
I didn' t know they made those anymore.
If you haven' t eaten yet, maybe we can go and... get a bite.
Someplace close.
You know, I saw a Chinese over here.
We could use chopsticks and drop an endless variety of things on our clothes.
Oh.
All right.
Please.
I didn' t mean anything by that.
I' il buy you a new one.
Excuse me.
Mr. Clark, I take dance very seriously.
Miss Mitzi' s is a school, not a disco.
And I hope you didn' t join class with me as your goal, because you' d be wasting your time.
Don' t dance if that' s what you' re after.
Dance lessons?
My husband is taking dance lessons?
Well, I' ve found a lot worse hiding in the potpourri over the years.
Consider yourself lucky.
What' s this beautiful young woman?
Who' s she?
His regular teacher' s a much older woman.
Great legs, but older.
Mr. Devine, what would make a man who' s done the same thing for the last 20 years... suddenly do something so completely out of character just out of the blue?
I' m just a detective.
I' m asking you as a man.
Scottie?
What would cause a man after 20 years... to do something completely out of character out of the blue?
- Did I get that right?
- Yeah.
"The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation."
Maybe the desperation can' t be quiet anymore.
Bingo.
That' s a wonderful use of Thoreau, Scottie.
Thank you.
Hello again, Mrs. Clark.
Hey.
- Desperation.
- Well, that' s a possibility.
Mrs. Clark, the point is your husband' s dancing, he' s not checking into hotel rooms.
We can continue to keep an eye on things for you, but my guess is your husband will hang up his dancing shoes shortly anyway.
- What makes you say that?
- Voice of experience.
He' il be home soon.
"The rest is up to you."
So I have these snapshots in my head of how they' ve changed over the years.
Moved to that island.
I suppose they take comfort in knowing what course their lives are on.
They like to believe they know what lies ahead.
Shit!
Dad!
What are you doing here?
Trying to meet up with some friends.
What are you doing here?
I had to come by and...
- It' s really weird.
- It is?
Because I' ve been wanting you to meet this girl that I' m crazy about, and I' m going to meet her right now at this bar with my other friends.
So can you...
Do you wanna go?
Lead on, my son.
Come on, let' s get out there.
So, does your dad wanna dance?
I don' t know.
Dad, you haven' t danced in, what, 90 years?
Go.
It' s been a long day for me.
Mr. Clark?
Mr. Clark?
Do you wanna dance?
Yes, I do.
OK.
Sure.
- Sorry I' m late.
- Don' t let it happen again.
Join the warm- up, John.
Come on!
Christ, Vern!
You' re soaking wet, man.
I already had a shower today.
- You' re disgusting!
You don' t have to put it like that.
And I prefer to tell the truth, unlike some people who make up stories about nonexistent fiancées.
What are you talking about?
He' s getting married in the fall.
Oh, come on.
What, are ya dumb?
People who are engaged take the classes together, or what the hell' s the point?
Come on, tell the people the truth.
You' re not engaged, are you?
Huh?
- I haven' t asked her quite yet.
- Thank you very much.
And then maybe pop the question.
But I guess if I' m sweating all over the place, that wouldn' t be too romantic, huh?
She' s a great dancer.
Well, hey, don' t listen to me.
What, are you...
Jesus, Vern.
I said I was sorry.
Bobbie!
Somebody call a doctor.
Are you all right?
They get crazy because she overworks herself.
She' s been in here twice before.
And it' s getting so boring, Mom.
- Shut up, Tina.
- No, you shut up.
God, she pisses me off.
She pulls a 12- hour shift at Jimmy' s Diner, working five till five, and then she goes and cooks and cleans for an old feeb in a wheelchair... to earn extra money for her crazy costumes.
And then she plays Cinderella every night at dance practice.
- When you should be home, resting.
Right.
You need to hang out and flirt with the shy guy with the nice- smelling sweat.
- She told me all about you.
- Shut up, Tina.
I never said his sweat smells nice.
I never said...
She said it was the best- smelling sweat she' d ever smelled.
OK, kill me now.
I' ve smelled his sweat and I agree, it' s not bad.
Well, I mean, it' s no field of flowers after a spring rain...
Yeah, I think we' ve talked about this enough.
Maybe we should all go home now and let Bobbie get some rest.
- Bye, sweetheart.
Thank you.
Bobbie needs a partner for the competition.
Why not you, John?
Competition?
No, no, I can' t...
Forget it.
Why not?
What are you talking about?
You heard her daughter - she likes you.
And dance begins with the dancers' feelings.
Two extra hours.
We' ve got three months.
This is good.
What do you think?
I think you better stock up on deodorant.
Anything a client says in a lawyer' s office is confidential.
So I' ve gotten used to holding onto secrets.
But a lot of people have accounts they haven' t reconciled - things they' re just not ready to share.
I took the liberty of ordering for you.
Bombay Sapphire, three limes.
I hired you to watch my husband.
You' re not supposed to be watching me.
It' s very hard not to, Mrs. Clark - with all due respect.
- Are you a married man, Mr. Devine?
- I was.
- Oh, what happened?
- Unfaithful.
- She hired a detective?
- No, no, no.
When she found out, I was too far gone, so...
You' re smiling at me.
You are on a strange journey to redemption, Mr. Devine.
And a very long one, Mrs. Clark.
All these promises that we make and we break.
Why is it, do you think, that people get married?
- No.
Because I would' ve taken you for a romantic.
Because we need a witness to our lives.
I mean, what does any one life really mean?
But in a marriage, you' re promising to care about everything - the good things, the bad things, the terrible things, the mundane things...
All the time, every day.
You' re saying, "Your life will not go unnoticed, because I will notice it.
"Your life will not go unwitnessed, because I will be your witness."
You can quote me on that, if you like.
I' m sure I will.
Anyway, the reason that I called you here today, to tell you in person that I won' t be needing your services anymore.
Oh.
I' m sorry for what I' ve done and I know enough now and... it' s time to stop.
Thank you for everything and... goodbye.
Bye.
Mrs. Clark?
You are a romantic.
Bobbie!
- A new costume.
- Yeah.
I got it from this mermaid dream I had in the hospital.
Just floated up from my subconscious.
Where, tragically, it did not stay.
Come on, partner.
What are you waiting for?
Divine intervention?
You' re a brave man, John Clark.
Not just anyone could take on the Bobbinator.
Yeah.
We' re with you.
Please?
John!
That means you' re gonna have to master five dances.
I' ve asked Paulina to videotape you tonight, so you can see what you' re doing wrong.
What?
It' s the rumba.
It' s the dance of love.
And he' s just not giving me anything.
What does she want me to do?
I' m doing it exactly the way I was taught.
You think it' s easy...?
Pull her back like you' re gonna have your way with her, right here on the dance floor.
Like she' s ruined you for life.
See?
Why can' t you just do it like that?
Anyone else care for a glass of water?
Damn it!
No, not you.
Look, I have to call you back.
No, he' s not home yet.
What was the score at half- time in the NBA playoffs last night?
Why?
Why?
You said you watched.
What was the score?
- I forget now.
You didn' t watch.
You care about dancing!
Shh!
Yeah?
Then what' s this?
Give me that!
No!
Give me that!
Give me...
It' s my mother' s.
At least, it was my mother' s until I took it to this wonderful alterations guy... who had it tailored for me.
Look, it' s not like I' ve figured this out either.
- Hey, listen...
- What?
- Come back to class.
- No.
You could take over as Bobbie' s partner in the Latin dances.
There' s no way I could learn 'em in time.
I' m not comin 'back as the Bobbinator' s partner!
We' il look like an olive and a toothpick together.
Besides, she would never dance with me.
Sure she would.
I' il still do the waltz and the quickstep.
She would.
No!
I' m not doin 'it.
It' s up to you.
I don' t care.
And he' il be a good competitor.
Right, Link?
So, finally giving up on the underage bimbettes... and gonna go for a real woman?
Is that it?
Yeah, no more underage bimbettes for me.
Only real women from now on.
You got that?
And quit lookin 'at my ass.
We' il try.
I' ve entered you both in the competition along with John.
Good.
That' s settled.
I' m the frame.
- She is the picture...
- She is the picture...... in your frame.
Everything that you do is to show her off.
- You got that?
- I didn' t hear that.
And... make the connection.
Projecting to the third balcony.
911!
911, quick!
Quick, 911!
9...
And start here with an initial sweep past the crowd.
Watch.
And contra- check.
Excellent.
Oh, Jesus.
We wanted something unusual.
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.
- You sure?
- No, I' m good.
I tell you what, why don' t we call it a night?
For your sake, John.
You look like you' re toast.
- Yeah.
- Get home safe.
- OK.
- I' m wearing you guys out.
No, no, no.
Takes my mind off my knees.
I' ve just been getting carried away, you know, working hard with the two of you.
I guess I like it.
For me too.
Well, I' m going home.
Hey, wait.
It' s just, you know, that people get the wrong idea about me all the time.
Paulina, you don' t have to explain anything to me, ever.
Well, I know I don' t have to explain anything to anybody... because I don' t care what people think about me.
Good.
- Yeah, uh- huh.
Good.
I shouldn' t be here right now.
No, it' s OK.
I think I' m just hungry or something.
- Hungry?
- Very.
- Oh, this is so stupid.
- No.
No, no.
I cry too when I' m hungry.
For French fries, usually.
You?
Cake.
Don' t spill it on your new coat.
- Old coat, new color.
I had it dyed.
- Yeah?
Yeah, my dad did it.
He' s a dry- cleaner.
As is my mom, my brother, my two older sisters and me.
I told you I know about stains.
- You' re a dry- cleaner?
Until I was eight.
She invited us to see her dance that night.
And I felt like she was trying to tell me something.
I took it as a sign.
And from then on.
It wasn' t the kind of dream my parents had in mind.
What made you wanna dance?
You looked on the outside the way I was feeling on the inside.
From the window I saw you practicing on the platform.
Oh...
That night I said all those things to you, I didn' t think I' d ever see you again.
But you kept coming back.
I didn' t want to.
But I figured if I hadn' t, you' d have been right about everything you accused me of.
It made me happy.
Yes, it shows.
I mean, I feel excited about something for the first time in such a long time.
- Aren' t you?
- Excited?
The competition.
I' m gonna forget everything, I won' t be able to put one foot in front of the other,
- I' il make a mess of the whole thing.
- No.
Give me one hour.
Leave the light.
Don' t say anything... and don' t think.
And don' t move unless you feel it.
Be this alive tomorrow.
Thank you.
God, I' m sorry.
I' m sorry, I lost my balance.
I lost my fiancé.
Lisa!
Lisa.
- There you are.
- Found the earring.
Photo op.
Come on.
Smile, everyone.
Paso doble!
- Good luck, everybody.
- Hey.
- Yeah.
So what did I tell you?
Girls love guys who can dance, right?
Check it out.
Cute.
- But who' s the guy?
- Oh, that' s her brother.
Yeah, we play basketball together.
Aren' t they adorable?
They' re gonna get slaughtered.
Don' t say that.
Mr. Clark.
John?
Breathe.
Thanks.
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.
The Chicago Taittinger Trophy Latin competition will now begin.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, your first dance is the cha- cha.
Music, please.
Nice chassé, Vern!
Whoa!
Let' s hear it for the cha- cha, ladies and gentlemen.
Who' s your favorite couple out there?
Let them hear their numbers.
We danced like shit!
All you did was worry about that stupid wig!
Well, what did you expect me to do?
You saw...
I know, he' s a pig.
But you know what?
So unless that thing looks good on your ass, lose it!
Fine!
We love you, baldy!
Thank you, dancers.
Please take your positions for your second and final dance of this competition, the paso doble.
Music, please.
Looks like he got rid of a lot more than the wig.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have the final results for the Latin competition.
Your finalists are... couple 102...
Lisa, we did it, we did it!
Couple 104.
- Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
- Couple 106.
Couple 109.
Couple 110.
And couple 105... has been disqualified.
What?!
I thought Slick Willy was pretty good.
Ungentlemanly behavior.
It' s a British sport, after all.
- The man was working it.
- Well...
Immediately following, the standard competition.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Chicago Taittinger Trophy standard competition will now begin.
Judges, this is a semifinal round with ten couples on the floor.
They' il be dancing the waltz and the quickstep.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, let' s bring our dancers out... with a nice big round of applause.
Couples 115...
Couple 116.
Couple number 117.
Couple number 118.
Couple number 119.
Couple 120.
Couple 121...
Wow.
Come on, come on, we' re gonna be late.
Hey, you' re not gonna choke on me, are you?
I think my feet are asleep, I don' t remember anything...
You' re great.
You look beautiful.
And finally, couple number 126.
- There they are.
They look nervous.
Them.
You invited them?
I thought she should witness this.
So you' re a marriage counselor now.
But could you at least bill Mrs. Clark for that?
I' d like to remind the judges that you' il be recalling six couples for the final round.
Ladies and gentlemen, your first dance is the waltz.
Music, please.
Well done!
He' s awesome.
Dad is awesome!
Spectacular.
It' s spectacular.
- 116!
- Whoo!
Way to go, Dad!
We weren' t terrible.
I can' t believe it.
Of course we weren' t - you were dancing with me, you big nut.... the second and final dance of this competition, the quickstep!
- Hey, is your daughter here tonight?
Why?
I thought I heard someone yell at you "Go, Dad."
Yes!
126!
Go, Dad!
Way to go, Dad!
- Beverly!
Wait, wait.
- Dad, you were terrific.
Get in the car, Jen.
Just get in the car.
Beverly, how did you know?
I thought you were having an affair.
- It' s ridiculous, I know.
I feel...
- Hey, listen, that was really bad luck.
There' s always next year.
Oh, "there' s always next year." Thanks.
Well, I have a whole year to prepare for it.
- Beverly, please, can we talk...
- No, there' s nothing to talk about.
Please.
Will you please stay here...
No.
- Please, will you talk to me?
- If you want to talk, you can start by explaining what was it that I just saw in there?
What did I witness?
There was no aff...
What' s goin 'on?
- Let' s go!
- They' re new friends.
But you could' ve told me about it, couldn' t you?
You just completely left me out.
Why didn' t you tell me, John?
- I was ashamed.
- Ashamed of what?
Of dancing?
- Well, then of what?
When we have so much.
And it' s not your fault.
Hey, Fred Astaire!
You' re blocking traffic!
Thank you!
After the initial shock wears off about that trust fund for the family dog, or the opera seats left to the gardener, there is at least the sense that everything is finally out on the table.
This, you are not gonna believe this, guys.
Louis, Louis.
"Link started dancing in 1985.
"It soon became his passion and he started dancing six days a week.
See?
I knew Link Peterson was a freaky bastard.
I think Linky Link might be batting for the other team, you know what I mean?
Could those pants be any tighter?
Look at his package!
Somebody get a magnifying glass!
There is nothing wrong with ballroom dancing.
Sorry.
Oh...
Fuck you all.
And football sucks.
- Hey, how you doin '?
- Hey.
Surprise.
- This is gorgeous.
- Yeah, it' s a pretty spot.
Thanks.
John, look, we just wanted to talk to you for a minute.
I mean, I know you always wanted to look at my ass... and I think you picked a pretty weird time to do it, but I forgive you, John.
Thank you.
OK?
Come on, can we tell Miss Mitzi you' re coming back?
I' m done with that now.
I really appreciate that.
Paulina, you know, she' s gonna go to England to study dance, and we' re havin 'a little, you know, going- away party for her... and we' d love for you to come.
Really love it if you would come by.
She gave me this to give to you, so...
Anyway, we hope that we see you there.
All right, come on.
- Bye.
"I' d hate to think that what happened would make you give it all up.
"You looked so graceful and brave out there - a different person from the one who first walked into Miss Mitzi' s studio.
"Everyone was convinced that we were going to win.
Expecting too much.
"Well, we didn' t win.
Angry at myself.
"But coaching you and Bobbie, seeing how alive you were out there... made me realize just how much I' d given up.
"So I need to thank you - thank you for helping me to see this.
"Paulina."
Thanks.
By the way, I' m not going to this party.
Oh, OK.
But you' re not giving up dancing, are you?
You could... teach me to dance.
Beverly, I' m not dancing anymore.
Why not, Dad?
Why don' t you teach Mom how to dance?
The one thing I am proudest of in my whole life... is that you are happy with me.
If I couldn' t... if I couldn' t tell you that I was unhappy sometimes, it was because I didn' t want to risk hurting the one person I treasure most.
I' m so sorry.
So, John, I' il see you at the party, huh?
# I love it when you give me things
I like this palette.
It looks lovely.
# But I...
# I love it when you sing to me
It' s beautiful.
Why aren' t you at the party?
Oh, because it' s a dance, and to dance you need a partner and... my partner is right here.
Beverly... dance with me.
I don' t know how.
- No, I don' t.
You' ve been dancing with me for 19 years.
But I don' t know the steps.
I' il teach you.
Here?
# And I
And now Paulina will choose her partner for her special farewell dance.
Paulina.
- You taught me well.
Come on.
- It' d be my pleasure.
- Let me show you how much I learned.
- I' m available.
There' s John!
- Come on!
- Come on!
Shall we dance, Mr. Clark?
I would love to.
Nice to meet you.
- Thank you.
Come on, let' s go dance.
# Thrill me
# I' il run with you
I think he' s a funny guy.
He' s original, he' s hilarious, he' s a superstar, and I have two tickets for me and my baby to go see him.
Gonna be a great show.
As he says, there' s black folks and there' s niggers.
I think he' s a very progressive black man.
I think he' s true with everything he says.
He hits home, I mean, all his jokes are on point and you know exactly what he' s talking about.
DC, are you ready?
DC, are you ready?
Give it up for my brother, the one, the only,
Chris Rockl
Thank you!
Yes.
Welcome.
Sit yo asses down.
Sit yo black asses down, man.
Thank you all for coming out to my fourth HBO Special.
That' s right, baby.
Number four!
Yeah!
Yeah, this is the Kill Bill one, you know what I' m saying?
Gonna do it right, man.
It' s good to be here in Washington, DC.
Lovely Constitution Hall, that' s right, man.
I haven' t done a special for a long time.
I was waiting for special things to happen, and a lot' s happened in my life since the last time I was on the road, man.
I had a little baby girl.
It' s not a big deal.
I mean, even roaches have kids, right?
But I got a little baby girl.
And it' s amazing when you have a girl - you' re a man and you have a girl, it' s eye- opening.
Cos I realise I' m the man in her life.
And my relationship with my daughter is gonna affect her relationship with men for the rest of her life.
And every man in here has dated a woman with some daddy issues.
That shit ain' t fun, OK?
She giving you a hard time over some shit her daddy did in 1969, OK?
That shit ain' t never fun.
I' m looking at her in her stroller, and sometimes I pick her up and stare at her and I realise my only job in life... is to keep her off the pole.
Keep my baby off the pole!
They don' t grade fathers but if your daughter' s a stripper, you fucked up.
You went mighty wrong there, baby.
You thought you had a household?
No, you got a ho camp.
I' m not making fun of the strippers cos some of these girls were abused.
Some of them just missed a few hugs.
Some of them were like, "Daddy, can we talk?"
"Hey, I' m watching the game."
"I' il show you!
"I' m gonna dance naked to Mötley Crüe records.
"I' m gonna change my name to Cinder Buns
"and I' m gonna wear clear heels."
When did that happen?
Was there a big old ho convention and all the hoes got together and said,
"We need something new.
"Something that just says' nasty '."
One girl said, "I got it!
Clear heels! "
You all right. "
I got nothing against strippers.
Somebody' s gotta do it.
Somebody has to take on the monumental responsibility that the strippers do.
Somebody' s gotta do it, somebody has to entertain the married men of America.
Somebody has to do it.
Your wife, you know, your wife will take care of you but she ain' t gonna entertain you.
Give your wife clear heels - "What the fuck is this shit?
"Get this ho shit out my house.
"Now wash your hands so you can eat."
I got nothing against the strippers.
But the strip clubs are very addictive.
Not to me but to other people.
They are addictive.
Every guy in here got a friend that' s addicted to strip clubs.
Addicted.
You know those guys that cannot function in a normal club.
You take 'em to a normal club, they ask one girl to dance -
"Would you like to dance?"
"Maybe later."
"Yo, man, let' s go to the titty bar.
"Man, these bitches is stuck up, man.
"I gave this bitch a dollar, she didn' t do nothing."
We all got those friends that' s addicted to strip clubs.
You know those guys that go to the strip club in the daytime?
If you at a strip club and the sun is out, you got some problems.
You know those guys that eat at the strip club?
Eat at the buffet.
How the fuck could you eat at a nasty- ass strip club?
What?
Are you that hungry?
Motherfucker, go to Mickey D' s or some shit.
Rwandan refugees won' t eat that shit.
At a damn strip club.
Titties and Tater Tots don' t mix.
I got nothing against strippers.
What I got a problem with is the stripper myth.
You know the stripper myth.
There' s a stripper myth that' s being perpetuated throughout society.
The stripper myth is, "I' m stripping to pay my tuition."
No, you' re not.
There' s no strippers at college.
There' s no clear heels in biology.
I didn' t know they had a college that only took one- dollar bills.
And if they got so many strippers at college, how come I never got a smart lap dance?
I never got a girl that sat on my lap and said, "If I was you, I would diversify my portfolio."
"You know, ever since the end of the Cold War, I find NATO obsolete."
Now, I' m 39 years old, 39 years old.
Yep.
Some people are like, "Really?" Yeah.
New Jack City' s a long time ago.
Now, I' m 39, right?
And I still love rap music, I love rap music.
You know, I love it!
You know, I' m 39, I' m that age, I' ve been loving rap music forever.
As I get older, I realise I' m gonna love rap music when I' m 80.
Whatever music was playing when you started getting laid, you gonna love that music for the rest of your life.
So I' m always gonna have a soft spot for Whodini, you know what I mean?
Now I love rap music but I' m tired of defending it.
You gotta defend rap music cos people always go, "That' s not music, that' s not art.
How can you listen to that trash? "
In the old days, it was easy to defend rap music.
It was easy to defend it on an intellectual level.
You could break it down intellectually why Grandmaster Flash was art, why Run DMC was art, why Whodini was art, and music.
You could break it down intellectually, OK?
And I love all the rappers today but it' s hard to defend this shit.
It' s hard, man, it' s hard to defend "I got hoes in different area codes".
On an intellectual level.
It' s hard to defend "Move, bitch, get out the way".
Well, as you can see, there' s a bitch in his way.
Now he needs to move.
Thus the term, "Move, bitch, get out the way".
You need to open yo eyes so you can get the bitches out of yo way.
My favourite song right now is impossible to defend.
It' s impossible.
We should all be ashamed of ourself for liking this fucking song.
Lil Jon.
You know that shit.
To the window!
To the wall!
To the sweat drip from my balls!
To the sweat drip from my balls!
Skeet!
Skeet!
Skeet!
Skeet!
And you know what' s real wild?
You go to a club, you see girls dance to that shit.
To the sweat drip from my balls!
To the sweat!
To the sweat drip from my balls!
My balls!
I feel sorry for the guys that gotta pick a wife out of this bunch.
"Daddy, where d' you meet Mommy?"
"She was singing about balls at a club."
That' s why people always say rap music is misogynistic and it' s degrading to women.
But what I realise, man, is women that like rap don' t give a fuck.
Women that like rap don' t care what they saying.
If the beat' s all right she will dance all night.
Women don' t give a fuck.
The nastier the better.
I see girls on the floor dancing to the nastiest shit ever made.
Just on the floor, like - Smack her with a dick.
I' il put a dick in the ear, a dick in the ear.
Fuck her in the eye.
Blind the bitch.
And you know what' s wild?
If you mention to a woman that the song is disgusting and misogynistic, they all give you the same answer -
"He ain' t talkin '' bout me."
Smack her with a dick.
I' il put a dick in the ear.
He said your name!
"No, he didn' t."
Smack her with a dick.
Love rap music, tired of defending it, man.
It' s weird with rap music because people either love it or hate it.
Even the United States Government hates rap.
The Government hates rap.
You know why I say that?
Cos they don' t arrest anybody that kills rappers.
They don' t got no clues, no suspects.
They don' t have shit when it' s a dead rapper.
They don' t fill out a police report.
They don' t even have a chalk line for a dead rapper.
The cops just piss around the body.
Smack her with a dick.
If you wanna get away with murder, just shoot somebody in the head and put a demo tape in they pocket.
"This is a rap killing, let' s get outta here."
The Government hates rap.
Look at all the rappers, all the dead rappers.
I' m gonna list these motherfuckers, man.
Biggie Smalls, man.
Biggie Smalls gunned down outside a party in Los Angeles.
Now Biggie weighed about 400 pounds.
So they had to shoot him for a while.
There was some reloading in that drive- by.
It' s like the bullet had to hit another bullet that went in before it... just to really do damage.
They don' t got no clues, no suspects, a hamburger wrapper, nothing!
Jam Master Jay, man.
Jay, man, I miss Jay.
I miss that man.
Gunned down in a recording studio in Queens, OK?
They had surveillance footage of people coming in and out, they ain' t arrested nobody.
It' s like the guy came in the studio, shot Jay, recorded an album, then left.
They ain' t get nobody.
No clues, no suspects, not a Odor- Eater, nothing!
Tupac Shakur, man.
Tupac was gunned down on the Las Vegas Strip after a Mike Tyson fight.
Now how many witnesses do you need to see some shit before you arrest somebody?
Shit.
More people saw Tupac get shot than the last episode of Seinfeld.
And you know what' s fucked up?
Every year, Tupac comes back from the dead, records a new album with clues in it...
Every record got a clue if you listen real hard.
"The brother in the red shot me dead."
Right there!
Track four!
Pac is trying to tell us something.
Listen again!
"It was a nigger named Kevin." Right there!
Pac is reaching out to us.
Listen!
The Government hates rap, man.
And only rappers get gunned down like this.
I' il tell you right now, if Billy Joel, Elton John and David Bowie got shot, they' d have Bruce Springsteen' s house surrounded.
The Government hates rap.
Only the good rappers are dead, only the good ones.
Biggie dead, Tupac dead,
Vanilla Ice still alive.
The Government hates rap.
You mean to tell me they can find Saddam Hussein in a fucking hole but you can' t tell me who shot Tupac?
Shit.
They found Saddam Hussein in fucking Iraq.
Tupac got shot in Vegas!
In fucking Vegas!
Not on no side street, the motherfucker got shot on the Strip!
In front of Circus Circus!
Damn.
It' s all fucked up, the whole world' s fucked up, man.
Michael Jackson lost his mind.
What the hell is wrong with Michael?
Another kid?
I thought it was Groundhog' s Day when I heard that shit.
Another kid?
Get the fuck out of here.
That' s how much we love Michael.
We love Michael so much, we let the first kid slide.
Hey, man, the man made Billie Jean, leave him alone.
Another kid?
I' m fucking done.
I' m done with Michael!
I am fucking done, I am handing in my glove, OK.
I saw Michael on 60 Minutes.
Ed Bradley tried his best to make Michael look like a mammal.
Or somebody that drank water and breathed air, right?
He gave Michael the easiest questions in the world, the easiest GED questions in the world, and Michael could not pass the test.
It' s like, "Uh, Michael,
"do you think it' s proper for a 45- year- old man
"to sleep in a bed with 13- year- old boys?"
"Yes!"
"OK, let me rephrase that.
"Would you let your children sleep in the bed of a 45- year- old man
"that' s been accused of child molestation?"
"Yes!"
Ed Bradley looked at Michael Jackson like he wanted to say,
"Nigger, is you crazy?"
Like he wanted to take the 60 Minutes clock and push the shit forward, say, "Get the fuck off my show."
"I thought you said it was 60 minutes."
"It' s ten minutes, get outta here.
"Ya nutty nigger, what the fuck is wrong wit 'you?"
I' m done with Michael, man.
You see Michael go to court 20 minutes late.
What kind of black man gonna come to court 20 minutes late?
This ain' t Barbershop 2.
Shit.
He don' t even wear a real suit to court, coming in there looking like Cap' n Crunch.
Franken Berry?
Better take your black ass to Banana Republic and get you a decent suit.
What the fuck is wrong with that boy?
I' m done with Michael.
Another kid?
That' s like another dead white girl showing up at OJ' s house.
And OJ going, "I know what you' re thinking..."
It' s gonna be a sad sight when Michael Jackson goes to jail.
Oh, we gonna shed a tear when Michael Jackson go to jail.
It ain' t even gonna be sad the day he go in.
It' s gonna be sad like a month later when that perm grows out of his hair.
The shit' s all nappy and grey.
When his make- up' s all fucked up cos he don' t get the Crayola people to fix his face no more.
That' s a fucking sad- ass sight.
Remember we used to have arguments about who was better, Michael Jackson or Prince?
Prince won.
Yeah, man, Michael went crazy, then Janet lost her damn mind, whipping out her titty on a Sunday afternoon.
On a Sunday afternoon!
What the fuck is wrong with this girl?
This ain' t Déjà Vu.
This ain' t Magic City, motherfucker.
It' s the Super Bowl!
A titty on a Sunday afternoon.
People coming home from church, turn on the TV.
"Oh, Lord!"
A titty on a Sunday afternoon.
And a 40- year- old titty at that.
You can' t just whip out a 40- year- old titty.
That' s yo man' s titty.
That is yo man' s titty.
40- year- old titty - yo man' s titty.
20- year- old titty - community titty.
That' s for all to see.
The titty couldn' t even believe it was outside.
It was like, "Oh, shit, what the fuck' s going on?
"Close the door!"
Michael' s crazy, Janet lost her mind, now I gotta see Jermaine every week for the blow- by- blow.
I thought I was done with Jermaine.
I got the Do What You Did When You Did What To Me album.
I thought I was done with Jermaine.
Jermaine looked crazier than Michael.
What the fuck is up with Jermaine?
Is it me or is Jermaine the greasiest nigger you ever seen in your life?
My God, man!
Does he spray Armor All on his face or some shit?
Just greasy motherfucker, my God.
Just glistening like Patrick Ewing in the fourth quarter.
Just slimy.
Just greasy, shiny motherfucker, my God.
When Jermaine' s on the TV, I gotta wipe the grease off the screen.
I can' t see shit -
Jermaine must have been on.
The police can' t even capture his ass cos he just slips out.
The police are like, "Somebody throw some sand on that nigger!
Jacksons lost they mind, R Kelly lost his mind and shit.
What the fuck is wrong with R Kelly?
He got a lot of balls, OK?
Talk about, "It ain' t me!"
Got a damn sex tape out.
"It ain' t me."
Motherfucker, we know what you look like.
That' s you, OK?
There' s a damn Soul Train award right next to the bed!
Best R & B '98, that' s you!
I can' t even believe R Kelly would come outside after this shit.
At one point on the tape, R Kelly' s eating this girl' s ass out like it' s Puppy Chow.
He' s in her ass like he' s got diabetes and her ass got insulin in it.
Lookin 'like the movie 28 Days Later.
R fucking Kelly, man.
The whole world' s going crazy, man.
Siegfried and Roy, the tiger bit the man in the head, and everybody' s mad at the tiger.
Talk about the tiger went crazy.
That tiger ain' t go crazy, that tiger went tiger!
You know when the tiger went crazy?
When the tiger was riding round on a little bike with a Hitler helmet on.
"Oh, shit, I' m a crazy tiger.
"Oh, Lord, I' m crazy.
What is I gon 'do? "
Whole damn country' s all fucked up.
We so desperate for entertainment everybody' s falling for this magician, David Blaine.
What the fuck is this shit?
Are we so desperate that we fall for a trickless magician?
Where the fuck' s the trick?
Cut a lady in half!
Pull a rabbit out a hat!
Do something.
What' s his last trick?
"and I ain' t gonna eat.
"I' m in a box and I ain' t gonna eat."
That ain' t no trick, that' s called living in the projects.
Shit, man.
Kobe Bryant lost his mind.
What the fuck is Kobe thinking?
What is on Kobe' s mind going to Colorado, around all these white people, and not bringing Johnnie Cochran?
You gotta bring Johnnie to that shit.
The girl' s still alive, Johnnie' il knock this out in two weeks.
"Is she breathing?"
"Don' t worry about it."
What the fuck?
It don' t look right, man.
Some people are like, "If you hire Johnnie Cochran you look guilty."
Yeah, but you go home.
What, you wanna look innocent in jail?
I' d rather look guilty at the mall.
Kobe might go to jail, you never know.
A lot of people, "Oh, Kobe ain' t gonna go to jail cos Kobe' s cute and cuddly.
"No, he' s cute and cuddly, he' s positive."
Yeah, Kobe looks cute and cuddly on TV cos when you see him he' s standing next to Shaq.
But in real life Kobe' s like 6' 9 ", 6' 10".
Shit, when he get to court, he gonna scare the shit out of them white people.
They gonna look at him like he' s a big old black praying mantis.
He gonna sit down at the witness stand, his knees gonna be up here.
Put his hand on the Bible, it covers up the whole Bible.
And you see the girl, she came to court, she wasn' t fucking around.
She looked nice.
She got a nice pantsuit on, got her hair in pigtails.
Yeah, she ain' t gonna have on no clear heels now, no.
That' s right.
She got on some comfortable flats.
And some thick- ass stockings.
The thickest fucking stockings you ever seen in your life.
You gonna think she broke her leg, that' s how thick them stockings is.
She gonna come in the court like this.
"Your Honour, my stockings are fucking thick."
A lot of people say, "Well, this is what Kobe gets for cheating.
"He cheated and that' s what he gets.
That' s what he gets. "
I know some of you women been cheated on before.
I know some of you...
OK, fuck it, I' m sure most of you women been cheated on before.
Some of y' all are with the guy that cheated on you right now.
And the guys are like, "Would you shut the fuck up?"
"Do some old shit, 'toss my salad', one of them."
No.
Men are just low, ladies.
Some women are like, "If I lost weight, he wouldn' t cheat.
"If I was more beautiful, he wouldn' t cheat."
Yes, he would.
He would.
There ain' t nothing you can do, ladies.
The only thing you can do to stop your man cheating...
The women are like this...
Only thing you can do... is be there.
Where?
There.
Wherever he' s thinking about fucking her.
Just be right there.
And even then he still might lose yo ass.
"Hey, honey, look, a sale!
Let me go fuck this bitch right now. "
Oh, man!
No.
The beauty don' t matter.
Kobe cheated on his wife and Kobe' s wife is fine.
Kobe' s wife is gorgeous.
My God!
That' s a fuckin 'señorita out this motherfucker.
A hot tamale out this motherfucker.
Kobe' s wife is fine shit.
I would trade my wife and two aunts for Kobe' s, man.
I' il throw in a cousin and my momma if I have to.
Come on, Momma, we got to close this deal.
Don' t let all this celebrity news fool you right now.
That' s all it is.
It' s a trick to get yo mind off the war.
I think Bush sent that girl to Kobe' s room.
Bush sent that girl to Kobe' s room, Bush sent that little boy to Michael Jackson' s house,
Bush killed Laci Peterson.
Bush was fucking Paris Hilton in that video.
All to get yo mind off the war.
Bush lied to me, they all lied to me.
"We gotta go to Iraq cos they the most dangerous country on earth.
"They the most dangerous regime in the world."
If they so dangerous, how come it only took two weeks to take over the whole fucking country?
Shit.
Man, you couldn' t take over Baltimore in two weeks.
Get the fuck outta here.
Looking for weapons of mass destruction.
Can' t even find a Wiffle ball bat.
Ain' t even a fucking fly- swatter yet.
Give me something, shit!
Attack, motherfucker.
Nothing!
Not a damn thing.
"Weapons of mass destruction."
They got whatshisname, they got Saddam Hussein, that' s cool.
I was a little sad when they got Saddam.
That' s kinda like the Coyote catching the Roadrunner.
I guess Acme finally made some shit that worked.
I didn' t even know we was after Saddam, I thought we was after Bin Laden.
What the fuck happened?
I thought we was after Bin Laden.
Shit.
When did Bin Laden give Hussein the baton of hate?
When did he pass it on?
"They hate me, they hate me...
"they hate you!
Run! "
"Oh, shit."
Shit, man, when I heard we was after Hussein, I was like, "Really?"
That' s so '80s.
The whole war seemed like a bad VH1 special.
Hussein' s back and Bush is back and Cheney' s back and Paula Abdul' s back.
Shit, before you know it, it' il be Hammer time again.
Stop.
Hammer time.
No, when the war started, it was great.
Brought out a lot of patriotism.
Patriotism' s beautiful.
But slowly but surely, the patriotism turned into hate- riotism.
When the war started, it was great.
People had their flags up.
People screaming out "USA!" for no reason.
You go to a baseball game, a football game, a basketball game, people are, "USA!"
I' m like, "Hey, calm down.
"That' s got a little German on it, don' t you think?"
You know, people start freaking out.
People got it...
At first the war was cool.
People got into this whole hate the French thing.
I don' t understand that shit.
"Fuck France, man.
They don' t wanna help us out.
"Don' t eat no French fries.
Fuck the French, man.
"Motherfuck France, fuck 'em, man."
Cos they wouldn' t help us out in the war.
The United States is the biggest, most powerful country in the world.
Why the fuck would anybody help us in the war?
Would you help Mike Tyson beat up Urkel?
Don' t make no sense!
But people started freaking out.
The war was weird.
On TV you' d see these weird white guys.
Nobody here, you guys are OK.
See these weird white guys getting overly patriotic and they have their fucking flag hats on and their flag drawers and their flag pick- ups.
"I' m American, man, I' m American.
"Fuck all these fucking foreigners.
I' m American! "
You' re like, "Hey, calm the fuck down."
There was a lot of accepted racism when the war started.
"I' m American.
And that was cool.
Then it was, "I' m American.
That was cool.
"I' m American.
Fuck all these Arabs. "
And that was cool.
Then they went to,
"I' m American.
Then I started listening.
Cos I know niggers and Jews is next.
It' s like, any day now!
That train' s never late!
And people started screaming they was American.
A lot of white people scream they American as if they got something to do with the country being the way it is.
Like they was on the Mayflower or some shit.
When you break it down, there ain' t even that many Americans in this room, contributing Americans.
Check this out.
If you a veteran, if you fought in any war for the United States, you are American.
God bless all the veterans.
Big up to the veterans.
I can' t say nothing wrong about the veterans.
You American.
Now if you swam here from some shitty country that didn' t allow you Bubblicious, you too are American cos you overcame obstacles and made sacrifices to actually get here.
You are a true American, OK?
You really are.
Don' t let nobody tell you no different.
Everybody else, you' re just lucky.
You' re just lucky.
All you crazy white people, "I' m American!"
That' s it.
You think you' re better than somebody from France cos you came out of a pussy in Detroit?
The whole country' s got a fucked up mentality, man.
We all got a gang mentality.
Republicans are fucking idiots, the Democrats are fucking idiots, conservatives are idiots and liberals are idiots.
Anyone that makes up they mind before they hear the issue is a fucking fool, OK?
Everybody...
No, everybody' s so busy wanting to be down with a gang -
"I' m a conservative, I' m a liberal." It' s bullshit.
Be a fucking person.
Listen.
Let it swirl around yo head.
Then form yo opinion.
No normal, decent person is one thing, OK?
I got some shit I' m conservative about, I got some shit I' m liberal about.
Crime, I' m conservative.
Prostitution, I' m liberal.
And they keep trying to scare us.
Everybody' s trying to scare us.
Telling us to be on the lookout for al- Qaeda.
Like, "Where?"
I ain' t scared of al- Qaeda.
I' m from Brooklyn, I don' t give a fuck about al- Qaeda.
Motherfucking al- Qaeda.
Shit, did al- Qaeda blow up the building in Oklahoma?
No.
Did al- Qaeda put anthrax in your mail?
No.
Did al- Qaeda drag James Byrd down the street till his eyeballs popped out of his fucking head?
I ain' t scared of al- Qaeda, I' m scared of Al Cracker.
Cracker Al.
Gotta look out for Cracker Al.
He' s a dangerous motherfucker!
But American people, whenever you leave...
I love my country, but whenever you leave, you find out people really hate America.
It' s good sometimes.
Cos we got so much shit, OK?
America' s the only country in the world where people go hunting on a full stomach.
It' s beautiful.
That' s how good we got it.
America' s a great country.
But here' s the thing, people hate America cos we can' t make up our mind what we wanna be.
America does good things, America does bad things, America does schizophrenic things.
One cool thing America does, that I love, is we feed other countries.
It' s beautiful that we feed other countries.
Yes, it is!
But we only feed them when they' re starving.
Why can' t we feed them when they' re hungry?
They didn' t just wake up with flies around their lips and bellies out to here.
It took a while for shit to get that bad.
And our government' s like, "Nah, wait for the flies.
"Two more weeks.
Wait for the flies.
Come on, more flies! "
And we send them food.
Do we send them the good shit?
No.
What do we send them?
Anybody here have grain today?
Anybody going to McGrainies after the show?
Why can' t we send them the good shit?
Why can' t we send some Cheez Doodles, some Funyuns, some Twinkies?
Why can' t we just pour some gravy on the people?
Just get a big old vat of gravy and pour it out the helicopter.
There you go.
Drink up.
Have some gravy.
People going, "I love America!
"It' s raining gravy!"
Shit, give them a Whopper, it' s only 99 cents.
Shit, we call ourselves humanitarians, meanwhile we' re dropping 50- pound sacks on 40- pound people.
But I love America, man.
We got a lot of freedom in America.
For instance, abortion' s legal.
It' s beautiful that abortion' s legal, man.
I love going to abortion rallies to pick up women.
Cos you know they' il fuck you.
You ain' t gonna find a bunch of virgins at the abortion rally.
You might even see some clear heels!
"What you doing here, girl?"
"Fucked up again."
The abortion issue, it' s a woman' s issue.
A woman gets pregnant, she don' t wanna hear shit from the man.
"Fuck you, I don' t need you, motherfuck you."
Unless she decides to have the baby.
Then she' s like, "Where' s my cheque?"
When a woman gets pregnant, it' s a choice between the woman and her girlfriends.
A woman gets pregnant, her and her girlfriends get together, and they have a little abortion tribunal, and they vote on the baby like it' s Survivor.
Each girlfriend puts in her two cents.
One goes, "Child, you should have that baby.
"That man got some good hair, it' s wavy, it' s wavy."
The other girlfriend goes, "Why are we talking about this?
"Ain' t we going to Cancun next week?
Get rid of that baby! "
And that' s how life is decided in America.
Now, fellas, if you get a woman pregnant, you' re only allowed to say two things.
And guess what, fellas?
You can' t even suggest abortion.
If you say, "A", you fucked up.
You can' t even suggest abortion.
Guess what, guys?
You don' t wanna suggest abortion.
If you suggest abortion and then she has the baby, when that kid' s about five, six years old, he gonna be cursing yo ass out.
You go, "What' s up, little man?
"I' m alive, that' s how the fuck I' m doing!
"You wanted me dead, huh, bitch?
"I' m alive, motherfucker.
"I should bust a cap in yo ass."
You don' t need that drama.
So do not suggest abortion.
Now, fellas, if you get a woman pregnant, you only got two things to say.
Two ways to try it on.
Now, the first thing you can say is, "Wow, I can' t believe you' re pregnant.
"I' m so happy.
I can' t wait for you to have this baby.
I love you so much. "
I' il try it again.
"Wow, I can' t believe that you' re pregnant.
"I' m so happy.
I can' t wait to have this baby.
"I love you so much."
That' s cool.
Now, if you don' t wanna say that, you got one more choice.
A woman walks in the room, tells you that she' s pregnant, you look her dead in the eye and you say...
"So what you gonna do?"
Good, it ain' t just me.
One thing I don' t like about America is we got real bad drug policy.
Horrible drug policy.
For getting high, man.
That' s fucked up, man.
The Government says drugs are illegal because we' re trying to protect society.
But they don' t give a fuck about yo safety, they sell guns at Wal- Mart, they don' t give a fuck about you.
No, the Government' s like this - they don' t want you to use your drugs, they want you to use their drugs.
So every night on TV you see a weird- ass drug commercial trying to get you hooked on some legal shit.
And they just keep naming symptoms till they get one that you fucking got, OK?
It' s like, "Are you sad?
Are you lonely?
You got athlete' s foot?
Are you cold?
What you got?
You want this pill, huh, motherfucker.
"You got to take this pill."
They don' t even tell you what the pill does.
You see a lady on a horse or a man in the tub.
And they just keep naming symptoms.
"Are you depressed?
Are you lonely?
Do your teeth hurt? "What the fuck?
I saw a commercial the other day that said, "Do you go to bed at night
"and wake up in the morning?"
I got that.
I' m sick, I need that pill.
The Government trying to get you hooked on some legal fucking shit.
And that' s the truth, man.
The reason coke and weed are illegal in America don' t got shit to do with yo safety.
The reason that coke and weed are illegal in America is cos the best coke and weed ain' t made in America.
If they made the good shit here, there' d be a coke and weed restaurant on every fucking corner.
That' s right.
Wouldn' t be no Starbucks, it' d be Weedbucks.
McDonald' s, McCokeald' s.
Uh, get me a Happy Meal and an eight- ball, thank you.
Krispy Kreme, Kracky Kreme.
That' s how good Krispy Kreme doughnuts are.
Krispy Kreme doughnuts are so good, if I told you they had crack in it, you' d go, "I knew something was up.
"I knew.
These doughnuts are too damn good, man.
"Got me knockin 'on the doughnut window at two in the morning.
"Come on, man, open up, man.
"Give me one more doughnut!
I' il do anything!
"I' il suck your dick!"
That should be the new slogan for Krispy Kreme.
Krispy Kreme - so good you' il suck a dick.
These are some good- ass doughnuts.
You' d be mad if your kid ate your doughnuts.
"You know what I had to do to get them doughnuts?
Leave them alone!
"Now I gotta go out and suck some more dick for doughnuts.
"Kids will never learn, shit."
No, man, the Government, they will never legalise drugs in America.
That' s first of all.
For bullshit.
The second reason the Government will never legalise drugs in America is because, God forbid, some brown people got wealthy.
Can' t have that.
Cos drugs come from brown countries.
We can' t have wealthy brown people.
There are no wealthy black - or brown - people in America.
We got some rich ones, we don' t got no fucking wealth.
People go, "What' s the difference?"
Here' s the difference.
Shaq is rich.
The white man that signs his cheque is wealthy.
"Here you go, Shaq.
Go buy yourself a bouncing car.
"Bling- bling!"
I' m not talking 'bout rich, I' m talking' bout wealth, OK?
I' m talking about the white family that owns all the Similac.
Those rich motherfuckers.
I' m talking about the white family that owns the colour blue.
Those rich bastards.
I ain' t talking 'bout Oprah, I' m talking' bout Bill Gates, OK?
If Bill Gates woke up tomorrow with Oprah' s money he' d jump out a fucking window.
He' d slit his throat on the way down.
"Ah, shit.
"I can' t even put gas in my plane."
I' m not talking 'bout rich, I' m talking' bout wealth.
Cos wealth will set us fucking free, OK?
Cos wealth is empowering.
Wealth can uplift communities from poverty, OK?
A white man gets wealthy, he builds Wal- Marts and makes other white people have some motherfucking money.
A brother gets rich, he buys some motherfucking jewellery, OK?
Do you know what the fuck I' m talking 'bout?
I ain' t talking 'bout rich, I' m talking' bout wealth.
Wealth is passed down from generation to generation.
You can' t get rid of wealth.
Rich is some shit you can lose with a crazy summer and a drug habit.
Fuck, Rick James was rich.
One minute you' re singing Super Freak, the next you' re doing Old Navy commercials.
Give me corduroy! "
Not talking 'bout rich, I' m talking' bout wealth.
Don' t get me wrong, it' s not all white people' s fault that black and brown people don' t have any fucking wealth.
Maybe - now just maybe - maybe if we didn' t spend all our money on rims we might have some... to invest.
We don' t give a fuck, boy.
Black people, we love rims.
We will put shiny- ass rims on any piece of shit car in the world.
We don' t give a fuck.
A brother would put rims on a toaster if you' d let him.
"Yo, man, I got some raisin toast sittin 'on 22s.
"22s!
Look at the motherfuckers, look at 'em!
"And they spinnin ', look at they spinnin'!
"They spinnin ', look at they spinnin'!"
We don' t give a fuck.
Money' s new to black people.
We the most money- wasting motherfuckers on the face of the earth.
We spend money like we think the shit' s gonna rot.
Brothers riding around with TVs in the headrests of the car.
The TVs is on and ain' t nobody in the back seat.
I ain' t talking 'bout rich, I' m talking' bout wealth.
Now, when it comes to acquiring a fortune, when it comes to acquiring wealth in the United States of America, different people have gone about it in different ways.
There' s a saying about wealth, there' s a saying about fortunes, and the saying is, "Behind every great fortune there' s a great crime."
And some of the richest, most powerful people in the United States are the descendants of drug dealers.
Kennedys, Brockmans, it' s all drug money.
They call it bootlegging but that' s just a white word that means drug dealing.
They didn' t sell boots, they sold the crack of their day, OK?
Now... when it' s time for other people to come up and acquire wealth the rules change.
One of the number one rules when it comes to acquiring wealth goes like this.
The rule is, only the white man can profit from pain.
Only the white man can profit from pain.
So if you' re black or brown, you can make money and prosper and get rich in America.
But whatever you decide to do, it better be positive.
Cos if one person is harmed, you will be destroyed, OK?
Every now and then Oprah has a show where she' s just giving away money.
You know why?
She' s trying to keep the Feds off her back.
Only the white man can profit from pain, OK?
White man makes alcohol, tastes great, I love it, you love it, we all love it.
Kills motherfuckers every single day, OK?
Some of y' all ain' t even gonna make it home tonight cos of alcohol.
Driving home, "That Chris Rock sure is funny.
"Oh, shit!"
But it' s all right cos it' s all white.
White man makes cigarettes.
Cigarettes are the most dangerous product known to man.
Kills motherfuckers every fucking day.
Cigarettes are so dangerous, it kills motherfuckers that don' t smoke!
That' s right.
First- hand smoke, second- hand smoke, people talking into machines.
"Hey, what' s up, man?
"I love cigarettes.
This shit is good. "
But it' s all right cos it' s all white.
Shit, could you imagine if the Philip Morris family was a bunch of jheri- curled niggers from Mississippi.
Do you know how illegal a pack of cigarettes would be?
You would get 60 years for a pack of Newports.
That' s right.
White man makes guns, nobody gives a fuck.
White man makes guns, kids shoot up each other in schools, nobody gives a fuck.
White man makes guns, no problem.
Black rapper says "gun",
Congressional hearing.
Like, "My God, that nigger said gun!
"And he rhymed it with fun!"
And that' s why people hate America... the hypocrisy of our democracy, OK?
That' s why they hate America.
But let me tell you right now, the number one reason people hate America, the number one reason, is because of our religion.
Americans worship money.
We worship money.
Separate God from school, separate God from work, separate God from Government, but on your money it says, "In God we trust".
All my life I' ve been looking for God and he' s right in my pocket.
Americans worship money.
And we all go to the same church - the church of ATM.
Everywhere you look, there' s a new branch popping up, reminding you about how much money you got or how much money you don' t got.
And if you got less than $20, the machine won' t even talk to you.
The machine' s like, "You better go see a teller."
You ever go to a teller and try to take out $8. 50?
It' s disgusting.
Man, you gotta wait on that long- ass line.
People doing real transactions in front of you.
You get up to the fucking front, fill out your form.
Eight- fifty.
The fucking teller looks at it, she looks at you, she looks at the chit.
She don' t even take the money out the drawer, she take it out her pocket.
"Wastin 'my time.
Get the fuck outta here, shit. "
I think every bank should have a box of ones by the door for they broke- ass customers.
I don' t need free checking, I need lunch money.
Trying to buy me some pork fried rice, man.
Here' s the other thing, man.
Drugs are illegal but ATM machines are open 24 hours a day.
24 hours a day.
For who?
Who the fuck is it open for?
Have you ever taken out $300 at four o' clock in the morning for something positive?
Shit, when you press that machine at four o' clock in the morning,
I think a psychiatrist should pop up on the screen and go, "Come on, man.
"Save your money, man.
"Don' t buy drugs, buy some rims."
They spinnin '!
"They spinnin ', look at they spinnin'!"
Americans worship money.
Shit, you know why banks are closed on Sunday?
Cos if they wasn' t church' d be empty.
I love America.
I got to say, America is the greatest country in the world, OK?
It' s the greatest country in the world.
It' s the best place.
There' s no place I' d rather be or be from.
Everybody in this room, lucky to be here.
Even black people, lucky to be here.
But if you black, you gotta look at America a little different.
If you black, America' s like the uncle that paid your way through college but molested you.
You gotta forgive.
What' s the biggest issue in America right now?
The most divisive issue in America is affirmative action.
No.
When you see footage of the '60s, see black people, see us getting sprayed down, dogs getting sicked on us, little girls getting burnt up in churches, that' s just white people being nice.
Nicer than they was in the '50s,' 40s, and '30s.
Shit, there' s black people that died in the '30s that was looking down from heaven in the' 60s going, "Man, them niggers got it good."
No, affirmative action was put into place to offset policies that the United States Government implemented during slavery that affect us today.
When I talk about slavery, I' m just talking about a period of time where black people had no rights.
So you' re talking about the 1600s to about 1964.
You know, give or take a year, depending on when yo town decided to act right.
People go, "What happened during slavery that could affect us today?"
A lot of shit happened during slavery that affects us every day.
For instance, during slavery, they used to take the biggest, strongest slaves and breed them and try their best to make big, strong super- slaves, OK?
And there' s evidence of that today.
Like the NFL, for instance.
NFL stands for Nigger Fucking Large.
They bred the slaves, and this is why black people dominate every physical activity in the United States of America.
We' re only 10%% of the population, we' re 90%% of the Final Four, OK?
We fucking dominate all this shit, OK?
Basketball, baseball, football, boxing, track, even golf and tennis.
As soon as they make a heated hockey rink, we gonna take that shit too.
Motherfuck Wayne Gretzky.
Wait till you see Lebron on some skates.
You ain' t seen shit yet.
He just gonna have one skate, chilling, "What' s up?"
He ain' t gonna have a stick.
He gonna smack the puck with his dick.
Slapshot bi- atch!
So that' s what they did to the big, strong slaves.
And you know what they did to the smart ones?
They killed them.
That' s what they did.
That' s right.
That' s right.
So the real smart motherfuckers had to hide the fact that they were smart.
The law of the land was, if you read, you die.
If you read, fucking die, OK?
So you know what that means?
The first black drug dealers didn' t even sell drugs.
They sold books.
"Yo, man, I got two pages, man, got two pages, man, check it out, man.
"Yo, man, I got a word, check it out, man, I got a new word.
"I got a new word, man.
It' s new, man, it' s new, man. "
So think about the poor slaves that could read but had to hide it.
Think about the poor slaves that could read but was scared to teach they kids to read for fear they' d be killing they kids.
Think about the poor slave who used to drive the buggy into town every day.
He' s driving the buggy - and he could read.
And up ahead he sees a real busy intersection.
He' s driving the buggy.
And then he sees a stop sign.
Now he' s got a real dilemma.
"Oh, Lor," what is I gon 'do?
"Oh, Lor, what is I gon 'do?
"OK, if I go across this intersection,
"I' m- a have a accident.
"If I stop at this sign, these crackers' il kill me.
"Oh, Lor, what is I gon 'do?"
And he don' t know.
And he' s riding the buggy.
He says, "Fuck it," and goes through the intersection.
He has a big old accident, wipes out.
Wipes out, almost kills somebody.
And the police come.
"Nigger, what' s wrong with you?
What the fuck is wrong with you?
"You could' ve killed somebody, nigger.
You see that stop sign? "
"I don' t know what you talking 'bout, sir."
"Nigger, you see that stop sign right there?"
"Do you mean that octagon thing?
"Nigger, who taught you octagon?"
Don' t get me wrong with affirmative action.
I don' t think I should get a job over a white person if I get a lower mark in a test.
I don' t think I should get accepted into a school over a white person if I get a lower mark.
But if there' s a tie, fuck 'em.
Shit, you had a 400- year head start, motherfucker.
White man, you gonna be all right.
You know, a lot of people say, "If you' re the smartest and the brightest,
"you won' t need affirmative action, if you strive to be the smartest and the brightest."
They say that as if the country is run by the smartest and the brightest.
I was in black schools and white schools so you can' t tell me shit.
When you go to a class, there are 30 kids.
Five smart, five dumb, and the rest are in the middle.
And that' s all America is - a nation in the middle.
A nation of B and C students, that' s all the fuck it is.
A nation of B and C students.
But let' s keep it fucking real, OK?
A black C student can' t run no fucking company.
A black C student can' t even be the manager of Burger King.
Meanwhile, the white C student just happens to be the President of the United States of America.
Other people got they problems right now in America.
What' s the other big issue in America right now?
Should gays be allowed to marry?
The beautiful thing about the gay marriage issue is it' s the absolute only issue the President will answer.
The President don' t give a fuck, he will give you a straight answer on gay marriage.
"Mr President, when' s the war gonna end?"
"Well, we' re talking to people, we' re looking for stuff, it' s out there,
"you never know how it' s gonna end."
"Mr President, when' s the economy gonna pick up?"
"Well, we' re talking to people,
"and economic indicators indicate that indications are coming to the indicator."
"Mr President, what about gay marriage?"
"Fuck them faggots."
Damn, that' s some harsh shit.
People always say, we can' t have gay marriage cos marriage is a sacred institution that happens in the church.
No, it' s not.
Marriage ain' t sacred.
Not in America.
Not in the country that watches Who Wants To Marry A Millionaire?
And The Bachelorette and Who Wants To Marry A Midget?
Get the fuck outta here.
Gay people got a right to be as miserable as everybody else.
Get the fuck outta here.
Michael Jackson got married.
How fucking sacred is that shit?
But I' m married.
It' s a beautiful thing, man.
And I don' t cheat.
No.
Not because I' m a great husband, just cos I' m tired of getting caught.
Gotta put the girls in the mistress protection programme.
From now on your name is Carol.
If anybody calls you Lisa, ignore 'em.
OK, Lisa?
"OK."
Bitch, you gonna get us killed!
The fuck is wrong with you?
You won' t last five minutes on the streets.
Now I don' t cheat, man.
Another big reason I don' t cheat is cos I never meet any girls that wanna fuck me.
I' m just not that celebrity.
I don' t bring it out of them.
Women see Denzel Washington, they go, "I' m gonna fuck him."
They start kicking off shoes soon as they see his ass.
Women see me, occasionally they wanna fuck me, but when women wanna fuck me, they get real practical about it.
They go, "You know what?
I bet you if I fucked Chris Rock,
"I could get him to pay my Visa bill."
I have paid so many college loans in my day.
I have put more girls through school than the United Negro College Fund.
Shit, I should' ve had my own dorm at Howard.
"And this is the Chris Rock Cafeteria.
"Chris loves sloppy joes!"
Yes, I' m married, and bored out of my fucking mind.
But it' s a beautiful thing, a beautiful thing.
If you' re in a good relationship, chances are you' re bored out of your fucking mind.
All good relationships are boring.
The only exciting relationships are bad ones.
You never know what' s gonna happen tomorrow in a bad relationship.
You never know when you' re gonna walk in and go, "Hey, you gave me crabs!"
That' s exciting.
I wonder what tomorrow' s gonna bring.
And those are the choices you got in life.
You can be married and bored or single and lonely.
Ain' t no happiness nowhere.
Married and bored or single and lonely.
Marriage is some boring- ass shit.
Once you get married, you gotta hang around other married people and that' s just disgusting.
You ever go to dinner with six neutered adults?
A bunch of women talking about Diaper Genies and hair colouring.
Shut the fuck up.
A bunch of men talking about barbecue grills and routes to work.
"Sometimes I take the highway but if it' s backed up, I got some side streets
Check it out.
"L- 95 is clear sometimes..." Shut the fuck up!
I hate married people.
It' s fucking disgusting.
If you go to eat dinner with single people, single people eat for an hour and 30 minutes and leave, cos they got fucking to do.
Married people close down a restaurant.
They start ordering coffee and dessert.
Start talking to the architect.
"I like the thing you put right there."
Start talking to the cook.
"What' s in the tea?"
"Water, bitch!
"Hurry up, we got a lot of not fucking to do.
"If you hurry up, we can not fuck all night."
I hate married fucking people, man.
You become a fucking pet.
Cos women like to get they husbands together that don' t even know each other, and have like a grown man play date.
Put you in a room with some other married motherfucker and go, "He likes baseball just like you."
And you' re in some room with some fucking stranger going, "I like baseball."
Yeah. "
"Yeah, baseball, good."
"Yeah."
"Honey, who the fuck is this?
"Get me the fuck out of here, I don' t need no new friends.
"If you wanna help me out, introduce me to a girl."
I hate married people, man.
Whenever I go out with other married couples, I like to bring a single crackhead.
Just to spicen up the activities.
Come on, tell us some of your cracky tales, please.
Married and bored, single and lonely.
The problem with relationships, people want too much.
Everybody' s looking for a soul mate.
"We' re soul mates, we' re one, we' re soul mates.
We' re soul mates, it' s incredible.
"His moon is my star and it' s a soul mate.
"We complete each other and finish each other' s sentences.
"The other day I said, 'Honey, it' s gonna rain,' and he said rain too!
"It' s amazing!
It' s like we' re telekinesic, we' re telekinesic.
"It' s incredible, my God."
It don' t happen.
Nobody.
Not even James Brown, the godfather of soul, he don' t even get a soul mate, as we all saw a couple of weeks ago.
James Brown looking like Nick Nolte.
Like, he put the good foot in her ass.
Nobody gets a soul mate.
All you gonna get in life if you lucky is a mate.
Just a mate.
Somebody you fuck, go to movies with.
You fuck, go to another movie.
You fuck, go to a comedy show.
You fuck, go to your grandmomma' s house.
You fuck, go to your momma' s house.
You fuck, go see another movie.
Somewhere in between fucking and movies, he goes, "Wanna get something to eat?"
That' s all relationships are, they ain' t that complicated.
It' s fucking and eating.
If you don' t like fucking somebody and you don' t like eating with them, y' all don' t need to be together.
And the longer you' re with somebody, it' s more eating and less fucking.
You don' t remember the last time you fucked but you know you had rice and beans on Wednesday.
You' re never gonna get a soul mate, the perfect person.
You' re never gonna meet somebody that loves Seinfeld and the Wu Tang Clan.
It ain' t happening.
Even if you meet the perfect person, it ain' t gonna be the perfect time.
You' re married, they' re single.
You' re Jewish, they' re Palestinian.
You' re Mexican, they' re a raccoon.
You' re a black woman, he' s a black man.
There' s always a obstacle in the way.
You' re never gonna meet the perfect person, it' s never gonna happen, OK?
Every now and then, God likes to play practical jokes on people.
God will send you on a double date with the perfect couple.
You ever been out with the perfect couple?
Ever made the mistake of going on a double date with a couple that' s actually in love?
You in the middle of your bullshit relationship.
And you sit down with two people that' s in love.
You can' t even eat your food cos you can' t believe what the fuck you are witnessing.
You got a fork in your hand, you' re like, "Oh, shit.
"He' s really listening to what she' s got to say.
"They really like being around each other.
"Man, we can' t hang with them no more.
They gonna break us up! "
No way! "
See, the thing is, men, we are ill- prepared when it comes to relationships.
That' s right.
You would think by now women would rule the world.
You would think women would rule the world.
But they don' t!
You know why?
Cos women hate women.
Women hate women.
You do.
You get any two girlfriends in this room, been girlfriends for 25 years, you put a man in between them, "Fuck that bitch."
Women hate women.
Guys are not like that.
Guys actually think there' s other fish in the sea.
If a guy introduces his boy to his new girlfriend, when they walk away, his boy goes, "Man, she' s nice.
If a woman introduces her new man to her girlfriend, when they walk away, her girlfriend goes,
"I gotta get him.
"And I will slit that bitch' s throat to do it."
Shit, every woman in here got a girlfriend they don' t trust around they man.
A good girlfriend too.
"I' il go shopping with her
"but I ain' t gonna leave that bitch with my man for five minutes."
I remember one time, one time I was in a restaurant, me, my wife, her girlfriend.
My wife said, "I' m going to the bathroom."
I say, "OK, I' il see you when you get back."
She said, "No, you coming with me."
And she made me come with her.
And she did the right thing cos I' d have fucked the girl.
I' d have fucked her on the quesadilla, I don' t give a fuck.
Nah, man.
But one thing I learned, man, once you get married, fellas, women wanna be responsible for all your happiness.
You got that?
Not some of it.
All of it.
Fellas, you ever have your woman catch you jerking off?
Ever have your woman catch you jerking off?
Did she get mad at you, even though she wasn' t thinking about fucking you?
Here' s the real deal, she ain' t mad you was jerking off.
She' s mad you was making yourself happy.
"How dare you make yourself fucking happy?
"I' m in charge of happiness in this house.
You' il be miserable till I fucking say so.
"Take your hands out yo pockets!"
Another thing with women, one thing about women, women hate for you to expect anything.
Don' t expect shit.
A woman can cook for you every day for five years.
The day you come home, there ain' t no food, and you ask nicely, "Honey, where' s the food?"
"What am I, your fuckin 'maid?
"You need to learn how to cook for yourself, you stupid motherfucker."
So, fellas, in order to avoid this, what you gotta do is act super- nice every time she does anything.
No matter how little it is, make a big deal out of it.
If she pour you some water, you gotta go, "Wow, water!
"Get outta here.
You' re so smart! "
She fucking folds a napkin.
"Wow, look at that!
You' re incredible. "
You gotta treat 'em like retarded kids, OK?
That' s right.
Married and bored, single and lonely.
That' s right, guys.
Here' s the thing - when you' re married, you wanna kill your spouse.
When you' re single, you wanna kill yourself.
Better her than me.
Anybody in this room that' s ever been in love will testify to this shit.
If you haven' t contemplated murder, you ain' t been in love.
If you haven' t seriously thought about killing the motherfucker, you ain' t been in love.
If you haven' t had a can of rat poison in your hand and looked at it for 45 minutes straight, you ain' t been in love.
If you haven' t bought a shovel and a bag and a rug to roll they ass up in, you ain' t been in love.
If you haven' t practised your alibi in front of the mirror... you ain' t been in love.
The only thing that stopped you from killing this motherfucker was an episode of CSl.
Man, they thorough.
I' d better make up, they might catch my ass.
See, relationships are hard.
But in order for any relationship to work, both people have to be on the same page.
Both people have to have the same focus.
And we all know what that page is, what that focus is.
In order for the relationship to work, both people have to have the same focus, and the focus is all about her.
It' s all about her.
She' s already there, fellas, she' s waiting for you to come aboard.
Fellas, when you wake up in the morning, you should look yourself in the mirror and say, "Fuck you.
"Fuck your hopes, fuck your dreams, fuck your plans,
"fuck everything you thought this life was gonna bring you.
"Now let' s go out there and try and make this bitch happy."
Yes.
It' s all about her, fellas.
Say yes to everything.
Everything.
Everything you can afford, say yes to.
Just say yes.
Before she even gets it out of her fucking mouth.
"Honey, can..." Yes.
"Honey, I..." Yes.
Just get a stamp.
Yes.
Another thing, fellas - don' t argue.
You cannot win.
You cannot beat a woman in an argument, it' s impossible.
You will not win, cos men, we are handicapped when it comes to arguing cos we have a need to make sense.
Women ain' t gonna let a little thing like sense fuck up they argument.
Cos she not in it for sense, she' s in it for distance and irritation.
"How long can I talk before this motherfucker snaps?"
They want you to shake the shit out of them till you hear the cops coming.
"Motherfucker, I' m serious!
"Oh, shit, let me get the fuck outta here."
That' s right.
And like I said, try your best to make her happy.
Try your best.
But here' s one thing nobody tells you.
You can' t make a woman happy.
It' s impossible.
I' ve never met a happy woman in my life.
Women are always complaining about something.
Women like to complain, women save up shit to complain about.
"He don' t even know I know but I' m gonna get his ass on that shit next month."
They like fucking complaining.
They love it.
No matter what you do, she' il be mad.
You can fuck a woman with a diamond dick and make her come ten times, she' il still complain.
"Why' d you make me come so hard?
"This diamond dick is cloudy.
"Why didn' t you go to Tiffany' s?
You' re so fucking cheap. "
No matter what you do, your woman is mad at you.
If you work all the time, "Why you work all the time?
You ain' t never home.
"You always leavin 'me.
I hate this shit. "
If you home all the time, "Why you all up under me?
"Let me get some fucking room to breathe.
"Damn, stop sweatin 'me.
I hate this shit. "
If you make more money than her.
I wanna make decisions too.
"You ain' t my fucking daddy, I don' t need you to take care of me.
"I hate this shit."
If she makes more money than you,
"You broke motherfucker.
Fuck this shit.
"I don' t wanna make all these decisions.
I need to be taken care of.
"I hate this shit.
I can' t take it. "
And the number one reason your woman' s always mad, fellas, the number one reason your woman is pissed the fuck off... cos you ain' t her first choice.
Fellas, you ever catch your woman just looking at you but not saying nothing?
In her mind, she' s thinking, "How did I end up with this ugly motherfucker?
"Lord, this motherfucker' s ugly and stupid.
"I had a good man and I blew it.
Kill him, please.
"Kill him while I still look good enough to get something new.
Strike him!
"If you out there, Lord, strike this motherfucker dead."
Nothing gets you ready for marriage, man.
Nothing gets you ready for marriage.
Nobody tells you that once you get married, you will never fuck again.
If you like fucking, marriage ain' t for you.
Shit, I haven' t fucked in seven years.
I' ve had intercourse.
Intercourse is when she gets out of the shower on the nice sheets.
Fucking' s in the back of a rental car when your woman' s going, "Come on, get some!"
Nobody gets you ready for that shit.
Nobody tells you that once you get married, you will never get pussy again.
If you like pussy, marriage ain' t for you.
I haven' t had pussy in seven years.
I' ve had vagina.
I hate vagina.
I came out of a vagina.
As soon as I got out, I said, "Man, I got to get me some pussy."
See, they don' t prepare you.
They don' t tell you married women don' t have pussies.
Married women have vaginas.
If you go to a wedding and the woman' s throwing the bouquet, she ain' t throwing the bouquet, she' s throwing the pussy.
"I won' t be needin 'this no more."
And the woman that catches it is gonna get married cos now she got two pussies.
You gotta marry the two- pussy girl.
But it ain' t just men that lose out on marriage.
Women, you lose out too.
Women, once you get married, he will never lick your pussy again.
Pussy, vagina, whatever the fuck you wanna call it.
He will never lick it again.
I see some married women with tears in they eyes right now.
He will never lick your pussy again.
Forever ever.
"Forever ever?" Forever ever.
He will never lick your pussy again.
That' s right.
Don' t get me wrong, he' il give it one coat.
But he ain' t gonna put the finish on it like he used to.
He used to put a spit- shine on your pussy.
You had to put on shades just to look at your pussy.
Put a little sticker next to your pussy -
"objects in pussy may appear closer than they actually are."
Nobody gets you ready for this shit.
That' s right, fellas, once you get married, no more blow jobs.
If you like blow jobs, marriage ain' t for you.
I haven' t had a blow job in seven years.
I' ve had fellatio.
like she' s going for her scuba licence.
You get married, every married man I know gets the same lazy- ass blow job.
It' s like three licks.
"Is it hard?
Put it in.
I gotta fold these clothes. "
What kind of lazy- ass blow job is this shit?
If we was at a restaurant I would send it back.
Waiter, this blow job ain' t ready yet.
Marriage is real fucking tough.
Marriage is so tough, Nelson Mandela got a divorce.
Nelson Mandela got a fucking divorce.
Nelson Mandela spent 27 years in a South African prison, got beaten and tortured every day for 27 years, and did it with no fucking problems.
Made to do hard labour in 100- degree South African heat for 27 years, and did it with no problems.
He got out of jail, after 27 years of torture, spent six months with his wife and said,
"I can' t take this shit no more!"
I' m outta here.
Y' all take care.
Thank you!
Best show ever.
It was hilarious.
Once you get married, life is over.
No more blow jobs!
I' m telling you, don' t get married.
I' il come and see him again.
See?
I just pissed on myself.
What a great show!
That was great.
Great show.

[Woman]

Too bloody long.

What do you want?
Shut your hole, bitch. i know you.
You' re Geordie from Nichol Street.
Do you remember me, Mary Kelly? i' d never forget you, McQueen.
You stop that now.
Buttons are hard to come by.

We all are.
And i... am makin 'sure... that no one troubles you. i' m providing a service, Mary Kelly... and i expect to be paid.
Or else you will be very troubled.
Now, you tell... your five friends... to bring me my money by tomorrow... or this friend of mine here will be your next customer.
- You' re bloody filthy this morning. - i bleedin 'stink.
What' d you get up to last night?
You don' t wanna know about it.
Give us a look.
Mary!
Oh, thank God i found you.
He' s comin '.
Albert' s comin 'today.
And, well, i need you to look after the baby.
Let' s have a hold.
Ohh! i' m so proud of her. i love her to bits.
She' s the most gorgeous little girl.
- [Gasps] isn' t she beautiful?
She' s lovely, isn' t she? i' il be seein 'you in a bit.
Get us a jar of gin, will ya?
- You look fine, Ann.
Must be nice havin 'a rich man lookin' after ya.
Don' t you think?
- Oh, yeah.
But, Ann, we' re all in a terrible way for money.
- The Nichols gang -- - They want our blood.
- Know what they said they' re gonna do?
- Don' t start that now.
What' s she saying?
They want a pound a week from each of us.
You count yourself lucky that you got a wealthy man to take care of ya.
We' re needing four pound to pay him, so i can' t spare the time. i' il get you the four pounds from Albert.
- He might say no.
- He won' t. i know he won' t.
He' s been in France on business.
He wrote he sold a lot of his paintings.
He' s sure to have full pockets and feel generous.
- To you, perhaps, but -- - i' il ask for meself. i' il get you the four pounds. i promise, Mary.
i' m not gonna hurt you, Netley.
Remember me?
Remember who i am?
Your charge will be coming down sooner than expected.
Much sooner than expected.
Be a good man, Netley.
Get him home quickly.
Quickly and quietly.
Understood?
Well said, Netley.
Very well said.
- Take them out.
- What is the meaning of this?
- Ohh!
- [Ann Continues Screaming] - i want this room in pieces.
Release me at once! - i demand an explanation! - it' s Albert.
- Get off me!
- [Ann]
Who knows?
[Whimpering]
i didn' t know. i swear i didn' t.
How could i tell anyone else?
Who knows?
Who knows?
i don' t know. i don' t know who they could be.
Albert must have mixed in with something terrible.
- She' s hungry and cold, poor thing.
i' ve got to take her to 'em. i' ve got to take her to Ann' s parents.
All right, you go.
Leave Baby Alice with them. i' il get to work, and i' il meet you later at the Ten Bells.
Notice something, inspector?
i paid. i already paid. i' m not after you, Emperor.
Move it!
Get up.
Get up!
Hello, darling.
Sergeant.
it' s night.
Well spotted, inspector Abberline. indeed, it is night.
The genius has returned to us.
Thank you, gentlemen, and remember... if you ever wish to escape the dreary confines of your present duties... this never happened.
Cut along, now.
Have i lost a day?
No, inspector. indeed, it' s only four hours since you left here.
Oh, deepest apologies for the, uh, rude awakening. i suspect you enjoyed that. i must be cruel only to be kind, as the poet said.
Although i would happily wallop you every time you chased the dragon.
Well, i had a sneaking suspicion you might interrupt.
You' ve seen something.
What did you see?
Are her petticoats saturated with blood?
You know, they used to burn men like you alive.
Sometime this evening a bang- tail was murdered in George Yard.
That doesn' t sound much out of the ordinary. it was the way she was done, inspector. it was the way the bang- tail was done... that cries out for a man of your talents.
Her name was Martha Tabram. i don' t know what sort of name Tabram is.
it sounds foreign to me.
This is not what i saw.
Not the woman of your dreams?
- [Whispers]
- Show him.
- You show him.
Why do i have to be exposed to this degradation over and over again?
i' ve looked at the mess twice!
Before he cut her throat, he removed her livelihood... as a keepsake.
Gentlemen, we are indeed fortunate today... to be able to observe an entirely new approach... to the treatment of insanity. it is -- Oh, Dr. Ferral. i was just saying, we' re here in the hope that you will permit us... to observe this new treatment of yours.
Well, i wasn' t expecting such distinguished visitors, Sir William.
But you' re all welcome, of course. i' m ready to begin right now.
- Who is your patient?
- Ann Crook.
An unfortunate, Sir William... who' s hysterical and violent... and has severe delusions of persecution.
Oh, poor girl.
Uh, do please proceed, Dr. Ferral.
Gentlemen.
We have one tap above...
and one into the left lobe...
and... one on the right... and this unlucky patient' s dementia... will no longer take a violent form.
Thanks to this simple procedure... we can now permanently alleviate the poor girl' s suffering.
What could i do? i had to leave the baby with Ann' s parents.
Rich man.
Thought he was gonna take care of Ann.
Knew that was too bloody good to be true.
They' re gonna kill every one of us.
Who is he?
Oh, for God' s sake, who cares about Albert and Ann' s troubles?
What are we gonna do?
We can' t stay clear of the Nichols boys forever.
You know, they say they held poor Martha down... and watched her bleed until she passed out, and then cut her throat.
- McQueen is mad.
He enjoys hurting women.
They want four pounds.
How we gonna get four pounds?
Not with my old cunny. i' d be lucky to get four pence.
Behave yourselves or bugger off!.
Yeah, you can bugger off.
We work, girls.
We work the streets harder than ever.
Right?
But hurry up.
The bobbies are fussing us tonight.
All right.
Gotta get the old man off first, right?
- Give it here. i' il put it in meself.
- Yeah, yeah. - is it in?
- Of course it is.
Come on.
No, it' s not.
You got it stuck between your bleedin 'legs.
- No, i haven' t.
Come on, get a move on. - i knows it when i feels it.
- That' s mine, Polly.
That' s my money.
i could pop your eye out.
Customers wouldn' t mind.
They don' t mind if a whore can' t see.
- What' s that?
What have i got here?
What have i got here, Constable?
Only a little thing.
Only a little thing to you, but a great thing to me.
Move, or i' il bash that smart mouth.
You' re a dead woman.
- He won' t bother you again tonight.
- Yeah, that' s right.
Look, one for the Nichols.
Right?
Come here.
Hey, we work the streets together. i' il keep my eye on you, love, eh?
Oh, you pig!
You disgusting pig!
Yeah, i' m a pig. i' m what' s wrong with the world.
Be on your own, then.
[Sobbing]
You don' t want the company of a pig!
What the fuck are you lookin 'at?
Thirsty?
That was the thing that was in my dream.
What' s it called again?
Cleopatra' s Needle.
Cleopatra.
She was a beauty, wasn' t she? it was carved 1, 500 years before the Son of God was born.
Six men died to bring it here... from Egypt.
May the Good Lord have mercy.
She was like that when i found her -- all murdered.
[Woman]
What kind of monster did this?
The boys have made their rounds of the taverns and the delightful domiciles... that make up this charming little street.
Would it surprise you to learn that nobody heard a sound?
Throat was cut, but there' s no arterial spray on the wall.
She was killed somewhere else.
- it rained last night, didn' t it?
She' s dry.
She was brought here in a carriage or something.
Throat must have been cut in the carriage. i imagine they stopped it just over there.
"They"?
- There' s more than one, then.
- Most definitely.
This was all in your vision?
Oh, Jesus.
So... definitely more than one person.
Has to be a message from the Nichols boys.
Am i right?
What the hell?
That' s grapes, isn' t it?
What the hell would a bang- tail be doing with grapes?
i' d like to give them an answer.
- What are you talking about?
- The Nichols boys. i would welcome the opportunity... to give them an answer to their bloody message.
There is most definitely a message here.
- You' re right about that.
- And what am i wrong about?
Martha Tabram was raped, tortured and killed.
That' s cruel.
But i' ve seen that sort of cruelty in the East End before.
This is methodical.
The butchery' s irrational... yet meticulous and deliberate.
Altogether a different breed of killer.
As soon as possible i' d like to know what he took.
What do you mean, what he took?
- Didn' t you notice?
He' s taken at least one of her organs.
[Coughing]
i want every veterinarian, butcher... and furrier in the district interviewed.
What did he do, sir?
Skin her?
- Pipe down, Withers.
Do you understand?
Yes, Sergeant.
He disemboweled her.
After he cut her throat, he stabbed her in the chest... cut open her stomach... and, uh, took out her intestines.
At least one of her organs was removed. i' m waiting for the police surgeon' s report for more details.
i see.
Maybe one of these red indians... wandered into Whitechapel and indulged his natural inclinations.
With all due respect, sir... i believe this was done by someone... with at least a working knowledge of dissection.
- An educated man, such as a doctor -- - An educated man?
That' s preposterous.
No well- bred man would do this.
Probably a tradesman or a butcher.
A tradesman is a possibility, sir, yes.
But there' s a strong indication against it.
There was a sprig of grapes found under her body.
What are you driving at?
No one in Whitechapel, no matter what their trade... could afford grapes.
Obviously they were given to her by the killer.
And it follows that he must be someone with money.
What about theJews?
AJew butcher.
Or a Jew tailor might have money.
There are plenty of them in Whitechapel.
Well, sir, for the sake of public safety in general... i' d like to be careful about spreading the rumors that it might be a Jew.
inspector, i know your reputation... for making brilliant guesses that turn out to be right.
Someone told me you claimed to dream the answers.
Frankly, it doesn' t matter to me what your methods are.
But be certain you don' t proceed without proof. - is that clear?
- Of course, sir.
Personally, i don' t care.
The fewer pinch- pricks on the streets, the better.
But the sooner you find this butcher or tailor, inspector... the sooner we can all celebrate your promotion.
Keep me informed.
He didn' t know nothin '!
Every stable!
We' il find him out!
Some bleedin' Jew!
That' s enough!
i have wonderful news.
Tell me.
Surely you, of all people, can guess. i don' t want to guess with you.
Dr. Marbury says...
Dr. Marbury says?
Dr. Marbury says i' m going to have your child.
- [Man]
Aye, to die... and go we know not where... but to lie in cold obstruction and to rot.
A simple "rest in peace" would suffice, Godley.
Yes, sir. in the midst of life we are in death.
Of whom may we seek for succor but of thee, O Lord... who, for our sins, are justly displeased?
Yet, O Lord, God most holy, O Lord most mighty --
Good afternoon, ladies. i' m inspector Abberline.
We' re investigating the murders of Polly Nichols and Martha Tabram.
Yes, we understand that they were both friends of you ladies.
Close friends.
We' re rather hoping you' d be able to help us out.
Don' t know nothing.
Me neither.
Why you botherin 'us?
You ought to be botherin 'McQueen. - is he the boss on Nichol Street?
- He' s the heart and soul of the gang. isn' t it your job to be knowin 'that small detail?
And what makes you think McQueen did this to your friends?
Can' t prove nothing by me.
- That' s right.
Well, Mary Kelly, unless one of you is willing to testify against McQueen... i can' t do nothing.
Surely, inspector... a strong, handsome man like you... you could do anything you put your brilliant mind to.
i' m a coward and a weakling and i can' t help meself.
What' s your excuse?
Why are you so bloody useless?
[Woman]
That won' t help us.
is that you?
Before my mother died, back in ireland. - is that when you came here?
When i was eight.
When things was good.
We were starvin ', but we were starvin' in fresh air.
i was thinking... we ain' t ever gonna earn enough to satisfy the Nichols boys... and feed our own mouths.
The ones who took her rich artist man and who took her as well.
You said they was clean shaven and their clothes was neat.
- Yeah, right.
- Well, they weren' t no criminals then. i mean, they weren' t the likes of the Nichols boys.
They was unusual.
Perhaps even official.
What are you gettin 'at, Annie?
Get paid for the story, you know.
"Where is Ann Crook?"
The papers are always desperate for things bad about the government.
And it' s a mystery to boot. it' s not a bad plan.
What do you think, Mary? i' m thinkin 'we should talk to that inspector, the one at Polly' s funeral.
Oh, fuck me, no! if we go to the papers they might hurt Ann or do something to her baby.
What, worse than what' il happen to her in Whitechapel when she sprouts teats? i don' t know for sure, but i think we' re better off talkin' to that inspector.
Lord, you are young after all.
Four bitches.
That' s what i thought.
You only paid for one bloody person.
- They' re my guests.
- Guests?
Well, let me welcome your guests.
Go on, get out!
Get out of here, you bloody whores!
When you have four pence... you can come back with your ladies- in- waitin ', Your Grace.
Oh, shut up!
Back to work, then.
- Well, let' s try and stay together.
- You know we can' t.
Then stay good and clear of Nichol Street.
Come on!
- All right, Annie?
Bloody bastard.
- Oh, very funny!
[Laughing]
[Chuckling]
i didn' t frighten you, did i?
i been lookin' for ya. i been lookin 'all over for ya.
You been looking for me?
Not for me.
On behalf of my gentleman.
A very fine gentleman.
He sent me to find ya.
Your gentleman sent you to find me?
Oh, get off. i might be unfortunate, but i' m not a blitherin 'idiot. it' s the truth. it' s the God' s truth.
He seen ya.
He likes ya.
And he said tonight only you' il do.
So he said to find ya, take ya to Hanover Street... where he' s waitin' for ya.
- You' re very pretty.
Go on, then, get in. i' il take you there.
Oh, i almost forgot.
My gentleman got you a present.
You like grapes?
Yeah.
Your gentleman, he must be very refined.
- Very refined indeed.
- Get in. - i' il take you there.
- All right.
Here we are.
- i' m like a lady.
- You are a lady.
Your gaffer, does he want anything special?
Just the usual, i expect.
Now, this alley takes you to a yard.
My gentleman, he' s quiet.
He doesn' t like disturbances.
What i wanna know, right... is a toff like him, how much is he offerin '?
Two florin.
That' il do me.
Go on.
- Yeah.
Straight down to the door at the end.
Straight down there, yeah?
You watch your mouth!
Any more information?
- My readers wanna know this stuff.
Found a piece of leather apron in her mouth?
No, Mr. Best, but if it' s your fancy... i' d be delighted to stuff your mouth with a piece of leather.
Come on, give us a tip.
[Woman Shouts]
You' re supposed to do something about it!
This is ridiculous!
There' s a bleeding murderer on the loose!
What about my wife?
This is Annie.
Another of the circle of friends.
Annie Chapman.
Dark Annie, they called her.
You still say this isn' t the Nichols boys?
Did the constable show you the leather they found down by the water spout?
Could be part of a butcher' s apron.
Leather apron.
Dear God.
We could be looking for a butcher after all. i saw her.
Last night.
i saw her face.
[Woman]
Let us see the body!
- Come on, let us see!
- Oh, God.
There' s your typical Londoner... imbued with the Christian spirit of sympathy for his fellow man.
Or fellow whore, in this case.
He' s really outdone himself this time, hasn' t he?
He not only severed the intestines... he carefully arranged them around the neck and shoulders. i think he' s taken more organs this time.
Grapes again.
Why grapes?
Only Polly and Dark Annie were given grapes.
Only they were disemboweled in such a meticulous fashion.
This ain' t killing for profit.
This is ritual.
Yeah, but why grapes?
So they' il trust whatever he offers.
i' ve never fully understood that tradition.
They' re for the ferryman... who takes the body across the river into the land of the dead. if she don' t have the money to pay him... she' d have to wander forever, lost between the two worlds.
i need to consult a doctor.
Are you ill, inspector?
A surgeon, to be specific.
The killer removed the victim' s uterus and its attachments.
My God.
He' s out of his mind.
That' s very astute of you, sir. i don' t appreciate sarcasm, inspector. i' m sorry, sir. i meant nothing by it.
You already have a surgeon at your disposal. i need a man with a strong stomach and a sober mind.
- No.
Request denied.
- Why?
Are you questioning my decision?
No, sir. i simply want to know why.
There' s already too much nonsense and gossip in the press.
You start consulting doctors... and all sorts of wild notions will be printed.
No one else is to see the bodies.
it is my honor... to present this... unique medical phenomenon.
Until last week, Mr. Joseph Merrick -- [Man Whispers]
John Merrick. i beg your pardon.
Mr. John Merrick... was an attraction at a sideshow.
Now he' s being cared for... at England' s leading hospital... and with your generosity... we will be able to continue to do so.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Mr. John Merrick.
Turn around.
He should have been killed at birth!
- [Guest Laughing]
That' il be the last one, Your Royal Highness.
- The psychotic patient is -- - Pardon, sir.
- You Dr. Ferral? - i am, yes. i' m inspector Abberline, assigned to Whitechapel.
- My lord, you' re the Ripper case.
- [Clears Throat]
- Am i right?
- Yeah.
Jolly good.
You' ve come to the perfect place.
We' ve got butchers aplenty here.
- [Man Laughing]
- i see. i could use the expertise of someone like yourself to help solve this case.
They tell me you' re the best young surgeon in London.
Really? i don' t see how a reputable surgeon could know anything about it.
Orientals and...
Jews.
Socialists trying to stir things up against our monarchy.
Don' t you think?
Excuse me.
You don' t belong here, do you?
[Match Strikes]
i' m afraid Dr. Ferral suffers from the surgeon' s malady.
And what' s that, sir?
Want of feeling.
He knows everything about anatomy... and nothing about the soul.
How may i assist you, inspector?
Well, forgive my ignorance, sir, but, um... are you a surgeon? i was.
Unfortunately, i suffered a brain seizure six months ago.
- Sorry to hear that, sir.
- These days i limit myself to teaching.
[Chuckles]
Well, sir... could you tell me what sort of a knife, uh, would this be?
[Chuckles]
i think you mean to draw a Liston knife. it' s named for Liston, who was a surgeon in the Crimean War.
Because there was no anesthetic on the battlefield... he had to carry out these amputations very quickly.
Uh... do you, by any chance, have the police surgeon' s report available?
Yes, i do, sir.
May i?
- We must keep this confidential.
- Of course.
- Thank you.
Wouldn' t someone have heard their screams?
Not if you cut their throats first.
And how can you be sure they wouldn' t react to seeing the Liston knife?
Grapes.
He offers them grapes first.
Yes, of course.
They' d gobble them up, wouldn' t they?
And he might offer them a drink to ease them down.
A drink laced with laudanum.
How do you know that? i found a sprig of grapes on both victims' bodies... and i smelled the laudanum on their lips.
Laudanum is a derivative of opium.
Apart from doctors and addicts, not many would recognize it.
How long have you chased the dragon, inspector?
Well, these should help with the headaches.
And, um... opium leeches minerals out of the body... so i' ve also given you a tonic... that will help to restore your appetite.
Thank you very much, sir.
i' m a fool. i don' t think you' re a fool.
Far from it. i ought to have known, sir, that you' re Physician Ordinary to the Royal Family.
Well, yes, it' s certainly an honor... but it' s an honor bestowed on many doctors.
Now, about our friend here, i can tell you this much:
He cut their throats from left to right, therefore he' s right- handed.
Excuse me.
He had to slice through four layers of tissue... and up to an inch of subcutaneous fat.
After that... he entered the abdominal cavity... so he would have had to use more than just merely the Liston knife.
Perhaps he was carrying a portable amputation kit similar to this.
What do you think?
is it possible, sir, that the killer is an educated man... perhaps someone who studied medicine... but who is, in fact, not a surgeon himself?
But, uh, the uterus?
Hard to locate, unless you know what you' re doing.
And he was working quickly, in the dark. i had held out hope that this... monster was a veterinarian... or a furrier or an... [Chuckles]
No, i must admit, if i were you... i' d look for someone with a thorough knowledge of human anatomy.
Damn him.
Do you want me to suck it? i can suck the Thames dry.
Don' t be frightened, dearie.
How far advanced is our grandson' s malady?
Uh, no lesions have appeared, ma' am.
But i' m hopeful -- more than hopeful -- that treatment will arrest the disease.
He seems to us to be suffering greatly in his mind. is the disease affecting his emotions?
Yes, well, of course his mood is depressed... because of the news of the diagnosis.
But that should improve as he regains his strength.
You are a true physician, Sir William. in all ways, you attend to the health of our empire.
We are grateful.
Thank you, ma' am.
if this is the beginning... of a five- pointed star --
- A bloodyJewish star.
- Withers! inspector is talking, which means you are what? - i' m listening, sir.
- Yes.
This area would form a likely point. i want double shifts within these streets until further notice.
And don' t only worry about Jews and butchers.
You stop anyone suspicious... including well- dressed gentlemen.
And by the way, Withers... the Star of David has six points.
Right.
Once more into the breach, dear friends.
Dismissed!
Why have you called me here?
it' s just -- it' s just you say three more have to be killed.
i can' t take it, sir. it' s everywhere. it' s in all the papers.
i' m just a simple chap, sir. i' m not a great man like you.
i just don' t know where i am at... anymore.
[Softly]
There, there, Netley. i shall tell you where we are.
We are in the most extreme and utter region... of the human mind.
A radiant abyss... where men meet themselves. i don' t understand that. i don' t understand, sir.
Hell, Netley.
We are in hell.
Get your hands off me!
- Pull yourself together.
Sorry about that, inspector.
She' s madly in love with me... although she hides it well.
You said McQueen killed your two friends.
- So what are you doing here?
- And i' m the fool.
- We' re watching them.
Can' t arrest them without evidence, so we watch them.
- What else can we do? - i' il testify. if you keep meself and me friends alive, i' il testify.
To what, precisely?
That McQueen said he' d cut me unless i pay him a pound a week.
- No.
- What you mean, no?
You asked me to testify.
Are you worried i' il let you down? i won' t. i promise i won' t.
You testify against McQueen, maybe he goes in for a year or two.
But his boys, they' il take their revenge on you and your friends. i can' t let you do it.
it' s your round this time.
i confess, i have an appetite.
One day, i' il be a great big round woman... with a skinny little man for a husband.
And a dozen plump children, i imagine.
You think that' s funny -- an unfortunate like me being a decent mother?
No, no, i didn' t mean that. i didn' t mean that at all.
You' il be a wonderful mother someday, Mary.
Honest. i can see it. i see you in a little cottage by the sea... surrounded by children. i can see it, Mary, clear as day.
- i really do have visions, you know.
- Are you serious?
Sergeant Godley calls' em my intuitions.
As a matter of fact... i had one about you in this case.
You have visions about me?
What might those be?
i want you to think carefully.
Besides McQueen, besides these awful murders... has anything else happened to you or perhaps to one of your friends... that' s a bit out of the ordinary?
Ben Kidney?
That' s Special Branch she' s describing, you know.
What the hell would Ben Kidney and Special Branch be doing in Whitechapel?
Wait a minute.
She' s irish- born, isn' t she?
There' s your answer.
A secret irish rebel.
That' s why they would be after her, right?
They were after Ann Crook... who was having an affair with a wealthy gentleman.
A child that' s now missing, along with its grandparents.
Drive on, please, driver.
[Whip Cracks]
You do not fuck with Special Branch.
They fuck with you.
i don' t know what you' re thinking, and i don' t care to know.
inspector Adderly.
Mr. Kidney wants to see me.
Mr. Kidney' s gone, sir.
Didn' t say where.
Could be for the night.
Where are you going, sir?
He said i should wait in his office.
And what floor is Mr. Kidney' s office on?
i don' t know what floor, you bloody idiot... because i haven' t been to his fucking office yet, have i?
But i' m more than happy to stand here like a knob... because you disobeyed Ben Kidney' s order. it' s the second floor on the right.
Thanks.
Free ireland!
Free ireland!
Get inside, sir!
That' s all.
Little more than a firework.
Anyone go in or out?
Yes, sir. i' m sorry, sir.
There' s an inspector Adderly in your office.
No, there' s nothing missing here.
The bastards have been in here, sir. i can smell 'em.
- No.
- Yes.
No, not together.
Too suspicious.
You wait for me, and if she' s in there you can go and visit her on your own. i' m going with you right now... or i' m going to the newspapers.
i mean it.
There' s a number of mental disorders for which it is necessary... to remove the front part of the brain.
Her records indicate that she was violent... threatening to do harm to herself... and others.
Does she have any relations?
No, she' s a ward of the state.
- That' s a lie.
- Listen to me.
You' re here to assist my investigation.
- Keep your mouth shut. is that clear?
Good.
What else do you know about her?
All we know is that she was an unfortunate... who lived in the Whitechapel district. i' d like to ask her a few questions.
You won' t get any sense out of her.
i' m used to that.
Hello, Ann. i brought Mary Kelly.
- Do you remember Mary Kelly?
- Ann, you know me. i' m your best friend in all the world.
Go away.
Ann, i' m gonna find Baby Alice. i' m gonna take care of her.
Alice is laughing to me.
Laughing to me all day long. it' s all right. it' s all right, darling.
What about her father?
Have you seen Alice' s father, Ann?
He' s a prince.
A prince.
And i' m a queen. i' m a queen! i' m a queen!
How do you know he was a painter?
He hired us to pose as artist models.
And what exactly does that entail?
We stood very still so he could paint us.
What' s the matter?
You think i was born a whore?
Oh, i' m sorry. i' m an unfortunate, not a whore.
Just a great mass of very unlucky women.
So, Ann Crook... and the painter became lovers -- is that it?
He married her... in a lovely Catholic church -- Saint Savior' s. i was a witness, as a matter of fact.
He married her in a Catholic church.
What do you think they' ve done to Baby Alice?
Special Branch dumped her in Bishopsgate?
Yeah, as an unknown.
- But why?
- When i find out, i' il tell you.
You have to.
- No, not yet. i need to know more first.
Look here, i promise... that i' il help you with Baby Alice, but not yet.
You gotta trust me on that, at least a little bit.
i do. i do trust you.
Good.
Do you have little ones, inspector?
No.
Ayear ago -- No, two years -- i' m sorry, more than two years -- my wife, um, passed away... giving birth to what i' m told was a son. i' m sorry.
Thanks.
i wanna show you some paintings on the way out, yeah?
- Why not?
Come on.
- Did you see the look on her face? - i think she stopped breathing.
She' s a fright.
She has cold eyes. i feel like someone' s walking over my grave.
There' s one more painting i want you to see.
You know him, don' t you?
[Priest]
Those whom God has joined together, let no man put asunder. i pronounce... that they be man and wife. in nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.
- Sir William isn' t receiving visitors.
Uh --
Sir William? it' s inspector Abberline. i need to speak with you, sir.
Sir William is ill.
Can' t receive any visitors.
[Shouts]
i said... you can' t go in.
[Gull] it' s all right, Dr. Ferral. i don' t mind company.
Have Anna bring us some tea, would you, please?
Ah, well, i wish i could tell you, inspector... that your story was fantastical.
Unhappily, i cannot. i know for a fact that the prince has a taste in unfortunate women.
And i suppose it' s more than possible that... he concocted this elaborate deception... to have some privacy while he indulged in his secret life.
But i know one reason i have for stating... that Prince Edward being Jack the Ripper is just incomprehensible.
What' s that, sir?
if you repeat what i' m about to tell you, both our lives are in jeopardy. indeed, i hope for your sake that what i' m about to say... will steer you clear of the very real danger you' re in. i think i' m well past the point of safe return, sir.
Prince Edward has syphilis.
Not a pleasant state secret, but a vital one.
Well, then that proves it. i couldn' t understand why the prince was killing Ann Crook' s friends... especially so savagely, but... he' s not merely killing them.
He wants revenge.
Don' t you see, sir?
No, inspector, i don' t see. i' m afraid your wild speculations about the prince' s mental state... clever though they may be... cannot overcome the physical impossibility... of his committing these crimes.
The disease is far enough along that... the prince' s hands tremble uncontrollably.
He' s very weak, and the killings ofJack the Ripper... require sure hands and considerable vigor.
And have you forgotten the most telling fact?
Whatever else the prince may be... he knows little or nothing of human anatomy.
Conduct the candidate to the center of the lodge and cause him to kneel... for the benefit of prayer.
Vouchsafe thine aid, Almighty Father of the universe... to this, our present convention.
Who is this?
A poor candidate in a state of darkness... who comes of his own free will... perfectly prepared, humbly soliciting... to be admitted into the mysteries and privileges. in all cases of danger and distress... in whom do you put your trust? in God.
How did he find out about the unfortunate and her child?
Well, he has that kind of cleverness... you' il sometimes find in the middle classes.
A cheap sort of intelligence, but effective nevertheless.
Thank God that' s not something you' re burdened by.
Yes, thank God.
Recite the solemn oath.
Never to reveal our secrets... under no less a penalty than... my throat be cut across... my tongue be torn out by its root... and that i be buried in sand... a cable' s length from shore.
You don' t think Gull is confiding in him, do you?
The old fellow isn' t as far gone as all that, is he?
No.
He' s not that foolish.
Let the brother receive the light.
[Voices Overlapping]
'Another beautiful murder will be committed by me. "[Second Man' s Voice]
"Fear me. Jack the Ripper."
- They' re rubbish, you know that.
They' re rubbish.
Though why you persist in believing that red- haired jezebel, i' il never know.
Have you considered that she' s the sort of woman who likes to make up stories... particularly about men?
She is, after all, a whore.
She' s a woman who --
"A rose by any other name." is that it?
Frederick, my dear chum, no one is more delighted than i am... that you' ve decided to resume your interest in the fairer sex... but please remember... a woman like that can make a man feel whatever she wants him to feel.
- Sergeant Godley.
- Yes, sir.
Arrest the Nichol Street gang.
- Right away, inspector. - i tried to stop them, inspector.
This arrived with this afternoon' s post.
Open it up! "i send you half the kidney i took from one woman, preserved for you.
T' other piece i fried and ate. it was very nice. "
We demand something be done, and done tonight. "From Hell."
Well, at least they got the address right. it can' t be.
Are you sure he was the same? i know him. i posed for him twice meself. i stood there naked as a babe watching him paint me for hours.
And he was with Ann for what -- over a year?
- Nearly two.
Ah, here you are.
Hello, girls.
Where have you been? i told you to wait for me. i can' t stay in a pub and not have a drink.
That' s cruel.
But look who i bumped into.
Remember Ada?
- She' s from France.
- Bruxelles.
Oh, she is pretty, isn' t she?
Not in public.
Would you give us a minute alone?
We need to speak with Liz.
No, Ada, you stay where you are.
Get a drinksy.
You don' t have to worry about Nichol Street for at least a week. - i can keep 'em that long.
- Well, that' s something, anyway.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
- Baby Alice, she' s all right?
- Yeah, she' s all right.
We' il get her out after this is over.
"We' il get her."
Listen. i want you and your friends off the streets until i can sort this thing out.
For how long?
- A few days, at least.
'cause we have no money for food and no money for a doss.
All right.
Buy some food, get a room and stay there.
Don' t tell anyone where you' re going. i don' t want to know. in three days, come to the Ten Bells. i' il leave a message with the barkeep.
What? it' s not enough? i wish i could show you the little village where i was born. it' s so lovely there. it' s by the sea, the way you said you saw me. i used to think it too small to spend a life in... but now i' m not so sure.
Don' t.
What?
Do you think i' m paying you back? i didn' t mean it as business. i' m still a woman.
Not yet, anyways.
- [Nightstick Strikes Wall]
Now, lad, at least take --
Sorry, sir.
One more time.
And curtsy.
And we' re done.
Oh, don' t be modest, girl.
They don' t care what we do.
i paid for your supper, remember.
Stop shaking your head at me, you slag!
- [Bottles Clanging]
She' s not yours.
[Liz]
[Mary Kelly]
They' il call the landlord on us.
Don' t go out. it' s not safe. i need something to sustain myself. - i will be right back.
- Do without for a night.
- No. - i want a fucking drink.
Here we are.
Service records.
Grenadier Guards.
Lieutenant Benjamin Kidney.
There, just as you suspected.
Ben Kidney served in the Grenadier Guards.
Part of his duties included assisting the field surgeon.
Let me tell you something, inspector, of which i' m absolutely certain.
Assisting an expert is different -- very, very different -- from doing it oneself.
Think about it.
Someone' s gotta clean up after the prince.
And whose job is it to take care of the widow' s messes?
Do you know that?
Everything is a suspicion.
And like that tragic Moor... all your suspicions will end up in your own demise.
For heaven' s sake, man, these women aren' t just being silenced.
They' re being murdered most brutally.
Why would Ben Kidney do that?
To scare people.
Which is?
Think what' s at stake for Special Branch.
Prince Edward married Ann Crook, a commoner and a Catholic.
A legitimate baby, who is, in fact, heir to the throne of England.
All these women were there.
All these women were eyewitnesses to an event... that could rip the empire to pieces.
You know that.
But she knows how dangerous it is.
She don' t believe you about the prince.
She thinks you' re feeding that copper candies to keep him interested.
Hello, sir. is anything wrong, my dear?
No, sir.
For a moment, i thought you were someone else.
Thirsty?
Always parched, sir.
Perhaps there is somewhere nearby that we might go... while my coachman keeps watch.
Oh, yeah.
This way.
Follow me.
Yeah, it' s this way.
Follow me.
i dropped my grapes.
[Muffled Screaming]
What the fuck are you looking at, Lipski?
Shut up!
- [Horse Whinnies]
- Sir!
it' s one of them, isn' t it?
Throat' s cut the same way.
Yeah.
He didn' t finish.
Well, she' s no less dead for that.
He won' t be satisfied by this.
Wilkins?
Fetch the ambulance.
Go on, run along.
Excuse me, miss.
You could be dead... right now.
But then there would be too many bloody questions.
ignore the old man' s blathering.
Or next time we won' t care who asks...
"Whatever happened to inspector Abberline?"
We should hurry up, sir. it' s clearin 'up.
Do you have a piece of chalk, Netley?
Chalk, sir?
- They found another one in Mitre Square!
Nice work, inspector.
You' ve encouraged him to do two a night now.
Out of the fucking way, cunt.
Katherine Eddowes.
There' s some writing on a wall just down the road there.
You should have a look at it.
"The juwes' are the men that will not be blamed for nothing." it' s hardly Shakespeare, but it' il do.
Slow down.
Make sure you get the apron as well, yeah?
it was written by the killer, sir.
And how do you know that? i was here three- quarters of an hour ago.
This building -- mostlyJews live here, is that right?
- Yeah, that' s right.
- Ready now, sir.
Put that away and get out of here immediately.
- Yeah?
- What?
- You heard me. - it' s evidence, sir.
- Listen to me. in another hour, there will be a thousand people poking about in here. if those words are seen, not a Jew in London will be safe.
So wash it off!.
That' s an educated hand, sir.
An educated man wrote that.
- Look for yourself. - i don' t have to look. i' ve seen it.
An educated man knows how to spell "Jews." i don' t know what this refers to, but i' m sure it' s got nothing to do... with the people who live around here.
Sergeant, i want two constables to wash that off.
What are you looking to him for?
Wash it off!.
Yes, sir.
Half a dozen men have seen it already.
The sergeant has copied it down. i' il remember these words for as long as i live.
So all you' re doing is destroying its value as evidence.
No, all i' m doing is taking charge of an investigation... that you have bungled to the point of gross inefficiency... and i' ve had enough.
You are suspended from duty, Abberline.
inspector Abberline is suspended.
- All his privileges are cancelled.
You' ve not seen her, then?
Well, if she comes around, give her this.
Long letter, eh?
This is for your trouble.
You understand? - i understand.
- Right.
[Man]
Recite the solemn oath.
Never to reveal our secrets -- [Screaming]
Grapes again.
Why grapes?
This ain' t killing for profit.
- You oughta be botherin' McQueen.
- Are you questioning my decision?
- Find a scapegoat.
[Abberline]
This is ritual.
"Juwes."
- it' s me, Ada.
Only me.
i bring everything for supper.
You little thief. i need this money. i just take some money and buy food for me and for you. is that bad, Marie? it' s fine, dear.
Until i go away from London, it' s not safe for you to go out.
Understand? i stay with Marie.
You don' t have to pay for your food.
Here' s to our feast.
i' m so sorry to greet you like this, inspector, but -- but i' m rather late for an appointment.
No, no.
Please, go on.
Thank you.
i' d like to speak to you about the Freemasons if i might, sir.
The arrangement of the coins at Dark Annie' s feet... and also the locations of the bodies... form a pentacle star.
A pentacle star is a symbol of the Freemasons, is it not, sir?
Yes.
And the way that all these women were killed -- throats cut left to right... organs removed.
They' re reenactments, aren' t they, sir?
Reenactments of what?
TheJuwes.
The traitors who killed Hiram Abiff, founder of the Masons -- that' s how they were executed.
So the great book tells us.
SoJack the Ripper isn' t just merely killing whores.
He' s executing traitors.
He' s a Mason fulfilling a duty.
Yes, i' m afraid, inspector... that you won' t be permitted to arrest him. i don' t want to arrest him.
The Ripper has one more traitor yet to kill... and i will stop him.
Did they come to you, sir... as a loyal Mason?
Did they ask you to help them cover up the prince' s secret marriage?
That' s how it started, yes.
And then you discovered the prince had syphilis.
He' s going to die of it, inspector.
Would you like a tour of the syphilis wards?
You' re a physician ordinary to the queen... entrusted with the well- being of the heir to the throne.
Only you... had reason to believe that these unfortunates... these whores... these... traitors... destroyed your life' s work.
Below the skin of history... are London' s veins.
These symbols -- the mitre, the pentacle star -- even someone as ignorant... and degenerate as you... can sense that they course with energy and meaning.
i am that meaning. i am that energy.
One day, men will look back... and say i gave birth to the 20th century.
You' re not going to see the 20th century.
Roll up his sleeve.
- Don' t struggle.
You' il only make this more painful.
You all right, mate?
[Onlookers Chattering]
You were describing the human heart.
And notoriously difficult... to burn.
About the size of a fist... it provides the motor power for the circulatory system.
The heart contains two atria, two ventricles... and four valves.
it is, in effect, a single pump... powering a double circuit.
in the adult the heart rate averages 70 to 80 beats a minute.
- a six- foot jet of blood... is released.
For you fear no God, arise.
[Echoing]
Your faith is well founded.
[Chattering, Shouting]
Don' t go in there.
There' s no need.
How bad is it?
She' s- She' s in pieces, sir.
Sergeant, he can go in.
- Give him to me!
- He' il be taken care of, i swear to it. - i want him.
- He' s done. i give you my word.
Fuck your word! i' il bring every last one of you fucking cunts down.
You and your fucking brothers!
Now, listen to me, Abberline.
Your situation -- your difficult situation -- has been thoroughly discussed.
You are reinstated. indeed, you are promoted.
- No!
This is not helping anything.
Don' t be a fool, inspector.
You will be very closely watched.
[Man]
Yeah, you' re all there now, ain' t ya?
Where were you when this was happening? it' s all right for you, standing around there chatting.
What about us? inspector Abberline is in charge.
Give him all the assistance he requires.
Remember, you' re being watched.
Clear this passage.
Move 'em away.
Back!
Shall we proceed, inspector?
Body lies in middle of bed.
Shoulders flat, but axis of body inclined toward right.
The left arm is close to the body... the forearm flexed at a right angle... resting across the abdomen.
The right arm is slightly abducted from the body. it rests on the mattress with the elbow bent... and the forearm supine.
The fingers are clenched, indicating a struggle as she died.
Notice something, inspector?
No.
A bit of a rush.
Left this for ya.
[Mary Kelly]
i know you asked me to wait. if i' m to be murdered, i' d like at least to die in my village. i' m going to the orphanage to collect Baby Alice.
Here' s an address where you can find us.
We' il wait for you eagerly. i know -- i know in my heart... we can be happy living by the sea... just as you saw. i hope to be with you soon, dearest.
All my love, Mary.
We are deeply distressed, Lord Hallsham.
We asked Sir William to remove a threat to our family and to our throne... not to engage in these ghastly rituals.
Oh, no, of course not, Your Majesty.
That was unexpected.
On the other hand, he has fulfilled his duties.
The threat is passed, Your Majesty. in his way Sir William has been loyal... and we are grateful for that.
The rest is in your hands, Lord Hallsham.
We wish to hear nothing further of this.
Knight of the East... we are gathered here beneath the God of love... and before the sight of the Great Architect to judge this case.
You stand accused of mayhems that have placed our brotherhood in jeopardy.
You stand before your peers -- Masons and doctors both. - i have no peers present here.
- What?
No man amongst you is fit to judge... the mighty art that i have wrought.
Your rituals are empty oaths you neither understand... nor live by.
The Great Architect speaks to me.
He is the balance where my deeds are weighed and judged... not you.
Knight of the East... hear our judgement.
Well, they' re not watching you anymore.
i' m telling you, it' s safe to go to her.
They think she' s dead. if i disappear or change my routine suddenly... they might wonder why.
You know who you' re gonna turn into, don' t you?
'Cause as soon as he' s had a few drinks, he goes on and on... about the girl that got away.
Do you want to live the rest of your life like a ghost?
No.
What i want is to go to her.
But at the slightest hint that she' s alive, they will spare no expense -- no expense and no trouble.
So i stay... and watch them.
Alice!
Come in, darling.
Coming, Mother.
Get up.
Get up!
Come on.
Good night, sweet prince.

Fox News now projects George W. Bush the winner in Florida...... and thus it appears the winner of the presidency of the United States.

It was our mistake.
<i>What most people don' t know is</ i> <i>that the man in charge... </ i> <i>... of the decision desk at Fox</ i> <i>that night... </ i> <i>... the man who called it for Bush... </ i> <i>... was none other than Bush' s</ i> <i>first cousin John Ellis. </ i>

While I strongly disagree with the court' s decision, I accept it.
What we need now is acceptance.
We have a new president- elect.
<i>It turns out none of this was a dream. </ i>
<i>It' s what really happened. </ i>
AI Gore, in his dual role</ i> <i>as outgoing vice president... </ i> <i>... and president of the Senate... </ i> <i>... presided over the event</ i> <i>that would officially anoint... </ i> <i>...
George W. Bush</ i> <i>as the new president. </ i>
<i>If any congressman wanted to raise</ i> <i>an objection, the rules insisted... </ i> <i>... that he or she had to have the</ i> <i>signed support of just one senator. </ i>
Mr. President, and I take great pride in calling you that...... I must object because of the overwhelming evidence...... of misconduct, deliberate fraud and an attempt to suppress voter...
The chair must remind members that under Section 18 of Title 3...... United States Code, no debate is allowed in the joint session.
Thank you, Mr. President.
To answer your question...... the objection is in writing, signed by a number of members...... of the House of Representatives, but not by a member of the Senate.
Mr. President, it is in writing and signed by several House colleagues...... on behalf, and myself, of the 27, 000 voters of Duval County...... in which 16, 000 of them are African- Americans...... that was disenfranchised in this last election.
Is the objection signed by a member of the Senate?
Not signed by a member of the Senate.
The Senate is missing.
It is in writing and signed by myself...... on behalf of many of the diverse constituents...... especially those in the 9th Congressional District...... and all American voters who recognize that the Supreme Court...... not the people of the United States, decided this election.
Is the objection signed by a senator?
Unfortunately, Mr. President, it is not signed by one single senator.
I have no authority over the United States Senate...... and no senator has signed.
Mr. President, it is in writing and signed by myself and several...... of my constituents from Florida.
A senator is needed, but missing.
Is the objection in writing...... and signed by a member of the House and a senator?
The objection is in writing, and I don' t care...... that it is not signed by a member of the Senate.
The chair will advise that the rules do care...... and the signature of a senator...
<i>Not a single senator came to the aid</ i> <i>of the African- Americans in Congress. </ i>
<i>One after another, they were told</ i> <i>to sit down and shut up. </ i>
It' s a sad day in America, Mr. President, when we can' t find...... a senator to sign the objections...
- The gentleman will suspend...
- New Democratic senators won' t sign.
- I object.
- The gentleman will suspend.
Inauguration coverage, 2001...... on a nasty, but it could be worse, kind of day in Washington.
- Justice!
- When do we want it?
<i>On the day George W. Bush was</ i> <i>inaugurated... </ i> <i>... tens of thousands of Americans</ i> <i>poured into the streets of D. C... </ i> <i>... in one last attempt to reclaim</ i> <i>what had been taken from them. </ i>
<i>They pelted Bush' s limo with eggs... </ i>
Stay back!
Get back! <i>... and brought the inauguration</ i> <i>parade to a halt. </ i>
<i>The plan to have Bush get out</ i> <i>of the limo for the traditional walk... </ i> <i>... to the White House</ i> <i>was scrapped. </ i>
<i>Bush' s limo hit the gas to prevent</ i> <i>an even larger riot. </ i>
<i>No president had ever witnessed</ i> <i>such a thing on his inauguration day. </ i>
<i>And for the next eight months, it didn' t</ i> <i>get any better for George W. Bush. </ i>
<i>He couldn' t get his judges appointed, </ i> <i>he struggled to pass his legislation... </ i> <i>... and he lost Republican control</ i> <i>of the Senate. </ i>
<i>His approval ratings in the polls</ i> <i>began to sink. </ i>
<i>He was already beginning to look</ i> <i>like a lame- duck president. </ i>
<i>With everything going wrong, </ i> <i>he did what any of us would do. </ i>
<i>He went on vacation. </ i>
Oh, no!
<i>In his first eight months in office</ i> <i>before September 11 th... </ i> <i>...
George W. Bush was on vacation, </ i> <i>according to</ i> The Washington Post... <i>... 42 percent of the time. </ i>
If I hit every shot good, people would say I wasn' t working.
<i>It was not surprising that Mr. Bush</ i> <i>needed some time off. </ i>
<i>Being president is a lot of work. </ i>
What about these folks that say that you' re taking too long of a vacation?
They don' t understand the definition of work, then.
I' m getting a lot done.
You don' t have to be in Washington to work.
It' s amazing what can happen with telephones and faxes.
Thank you so much.
- Yeah.
What are you doing the rest of the day?
Karen Hughes is coming over.
We' re working on some things.
And she' il be over here.
We' re working on a few things, a few matters.
We' re...
You' il see.
There' il be some decisions I will have made while I' m here.
We' il be announcing them as time goes on.
<i>The first time I met him, he had</ i> <i>some good advice for me. </ i>
Governor Bush, it' s Michael Moore.
Behave yourself, will you?
Go find real work.
<i>And work was something he knew</ i> <i>a lot about. </ i>
- Yeah.
<i>Relaxing at Camp David. </ i>
<i>Yachting off Kennebunkport. </ i>
How you doing?
<i>Or being a cowboy on the ranch</ i> <i>in Texas. </ i>
Oh, hi.
<i>George Bush spent the rest</ i> <i>of August at the ranch... </ i> <i>... where life was less complicated. </ i>
Armadillos love to dig the soil looking for bugs.
And...
So I went out there the other day, and there was Barney...... buried in this hole, chasing an armadillo.
<i>It was a summer to remember. </ i>
<i>Afterward, he left Texas for</ i> <i>his second- favorite place. </ i>
<i>On September 10th, he joined</ i> <i>his brother in Florida... </ i> <i>... where they looked at files</ i> <i>and met important Floridians. </ i>
<i>He went to sleep that night in a bed</ i> <i>made with fine French linens. </ i>
Do you suppose he' s pretty confident...... on those numbers on Iraqi security forces?
Make me look young.
Yeah, I' ve got a little, sort of air noise.
Yeah, just don' t turn it up too much.
I don' t want to blow my head off.
I got a mike here if they want to use it.
Testing, one, two.
Testing, one, two.
Testing, one, two.
This is the Oval Office.
Testing, one, two, three, four, five.
We have something that has happened here...... at the World Trade Center.
We noticed a flame...... and an awful lot of smoke...
This is horrible.
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.
Let' s go!
Let' s go, back!
Come on, let' s go!
Oh, my God!
Save their souls, Lord.
Save their souls, Lord.
Oh, they' re jumping.
<i>On September 11 th, 2001, </ i> <i>nearly 3000 people... </ i> <i>... including a colleague of mine, </ i> <i>Bill Weems... </ i> <i>... were killed in the largest foreign</ i> <i>attack ever on American soil. </ i>
<i>The targets were the financial</ i> <i>and military headquarters... </ i> <i>... of the United States. </ i>
If anyone has any idea or they' ve seen him or knows where he is, to call us.
He' s got two little babies.
Two little babies.
<i>As the attack took place, </ i> <i>Mr.
Bush was on his way... </ i> <i>... to an elementary school</ i> <i>in Florida. </ i>
<i>When informed of the first plane</ i> <i>hitting the World Trade Center... </ i> <i>... where terrorists had struck</ i> <i>just eight years prior... </ i> <i>...
Mr. Bush decided to go ahead</ i> <i>with his photo opportunity. </ i>
- Good morning.
Good morning.
Get ready.
- "Mad"!
- Yes.
Get ready.
- "Calf"!
- Yeah.
Get ready to read the words on this page without making a mistake.
<i>When the second plane hit</ i> <i>the tower... </ i> <i>... his chief of staff entered</ i> <i>the classroom... </ i> <i>... and told Mr. Bush, </ i> <i>" The nation is under attack. "</ i>
<i>Not knowing what to do, with no one</ i> <i>telling him what to do... </ i> <i>... and no Secret Service rushing</ i> <i>in to take him to safety... </ i> <i>...
Mr. Bush just sat there... </ i> <i>... and continued to read</ i> My Pet Goat <i>with the children. </ i>
<i>Nearly seven minutes passed</ i> <i>with nobody doing anything. </ i>
<i>As Bush sat in that Florida</ i> <i>classroom... </ i> <i>... was he wondering if maybe</ i> <i>he should have shown up... </ i> <i>... to work more often? </ i>
<i>Should he have held at least one</ i> <i>meeting since taking office... </ i> <i>... to discuss the threat of terrorism</ i> <i>with his head of counterterrorism? </ i>
<i>Maybe Bush wondered why he had</ i> <i>cut terrorism funding from the FBl. </ i>
<i>Or perhaps he just should have read</ i> <i>the security briefing... </ i> <i>... that was given to him on</ i> <i>August 6th, 2001... </ i> <i>... which said Osama bin Laden</ i> <i>was planning... </ i> <i>... to attack America by hijacking</ i> <i>airplanes. </ i>
<i>Maybe he wasn' t worried, because</ i> <i>the title of the report was too vague. </ i>
I believe the title was "Bin Laden Determined...... to Attack Inside the United States."
<i>A report like that might make</ i> <i>some men jump... </ i> <i>... but, as in days past, </ i> <i>George W. Just went fishing. </ i>
<i>As the minutes went by, George Bush</ i> <i>continued to sit in the classroom. </ i>
<i>Was he thinking, "I' ve been hanging</ i> <i>out with the wrong crowd. </ i>
<i>Which one of them screwed me? </ i>
<i>Was it the guy my daddy' s friends</ i> <i>delivered a lot of weapons to? </ i>
<i>Was it that group of religious</ i> <i>fundamentalists... </ i> <i>... who visited my state when</ i> <i>I was governor? </ i>
<i>Or was it the Saudis? </ i>
It was them.
I think</ i> <i>I better blame it on this guy. "</ i>
<i>In the days following</ i> <i>September 11 th... </ i> <i>... all commercial and private airline</ i> <i>traffic was grounded. </ i>
The FAA has taken the action to close all of the airports in the United States.
Even grounding the president' s father, former President Bush...... on a flight forced to land in Milwaukee.
Thousands of travelers were stranded, among them Ricky Martin...... due to appear at tonight' s Latin Grammy Awards.
<i>Not even Ricky Martin could fly. </ i>
<i>But really, who wanted to fly? </ i>
<i>No one, except the bin Ladens. </ i>
We had airplanes pick up...
... Osama bin Laden' s family and other Saudis...... and transport them out of the U. S.
<i>The White House approved planes... </ i> <i>... to pick up the bin Ladens</ i> <i>and numerous other Saudis. </ i>
<i>At least six private jets and nearly</ i> <i>two dozen commercial planes... </ i> <i>... carried the Saudis</ i> <i>and bin Ladens... </ i> <i>... out of the U. S. After</ i> <i>September 13th. </ i>
<i>In all, 142 Saudis, including 24</ i> <i>members of the bin Laden family... </ i> <i>... were allowed to leave</ i> <i>the country. </ i>
It' s more complicated than that.
Osama has had contact with other family members?
Right.
In the summer of 2001, just before 9<i>l</ i>11, one of Osama' s sons...... got married in Afghanistan, and several family members...... showed up at the wedding.
That' s right.
So they' re not cut off completely.
That' s an exaggeration.
We now welcome to <i>Larry King Live</ i>...... Prince Bandar, ambassador of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to the U. S.
You had about 24 members of bin Laden' s family, and...
- Here?
- In America.
Students and...
His Majesty felt it' s not fair for those innocent people to be subjected...... to any harm.
On the other hand, we understood the high emotions...... so, with coordination with the FBl, we got them out.
<i>This is retired FBI agent</ i> <i>Jack Cloonan. </ i>
<i>Before 9/ 11, he was a senior agent</ i> <i>on the joint FBl- ClA... </ i> <i>... al Qaeda task force. </ i>
I, as an investigator, would not want these people to have left.
I think, in the case of the bin Laden family, it would have been prudent...... to hand the subpoenas out, have them come in, get on- the- record.
You know, get on- the- record.
- Yeah.
How many people were pulled off airlines after that...... coming into the country who were Middle Eastern...... or they fit a very general picture.
We held hundreds of people for weeks and months at a time.
No.
They were identified at the airport.
They looked at their passports, and they were identified.
That would happen to us if we left the country.
- Exactly.
- Interview, check the passport.
- What else?
- Nothing.
<i>I don' t know about you, </ i> <i>but usually... </ i> <i>... when the police can' t find</ i> <i>a murderer... </ i> <i>... don' t they usually wanna talk</ i> <i>to the family members... </ i> <i>... to find out where they think</ i> <i>he might be? </ i>
You don' t know where your husband is?
If you hear anything, let us know.
Can you come downtown, give a statement?
- You' ve got time.
Mine' s worth money.
Yours isn' t.
- Send a bill.
- I asked you a question.
- Answer them.
Don' t ask them.
- I pay your salary, cop.
Sit down.
I' m gonna earn it.
That' s how cops do it. </ i>
<i>What was going on here? </ i>
We need to know more about that.
It needs to be the subject of an investigation.
What happened?
Why?
Who authorized it?
... when jumping off that building to their death.
Those young guys and cops and firemen...... that ran into that building, never asked a question.
And they' re dead.
And families' lives are ruined.
- And they' il never have peace.
- That' s right.
No one would question it.
Not even the biggest civil libertarian.
It' s just...
- No one would question it.
Fine.
Counsel?
Fine.
Mr. Bin Laden, this is why I' m asking.
It isn' t because I think you' re anything.
I just want to ask you the questions that I would anybody.
- Right.
- And that' s all.
<i>None of this made any sense. </ i>
President Clinton helping to arrange</ i> <i>a trip... </ i> <i>... out of the country</ i> <i>for the Mc Veigh family? </ i>
<i>What would have happened</ i> <i>to Clinton... </ i>
- <i>... if that had been revealed? </ i>
- Burn him!
Burn him!
Prince Bandar, do you know the bin Laden family?
- What are they like?
They' re really lovely human beings.
He is the only one I never...
I don' t know him well, but I met him only once.
What was the circumstance under which you met?
This is ironic.
In the mid - '80s...... if you remember, we and the United States...... were supporting the mujahideen...... to liberate Afghanistan from the Soviets.
He came to thank me for my efforts to bring the Americans, our friends...... to help us against the atheists, the Communists.
He came to thank you for helping bring America to help him.
And now he may be responsible for bombing America.
- Absolutely.
- What did you make of him?
- I was not impressed.
No.
I thought he was a simple and very quiet guy.
<i>A simple and quiet guy, whose</ i> <i>family just happened to have... </ i> <i>... a business relationship with</ i> <i>the family of George W. Bush. </ i>
<i>Is that what he was thinking about? </ i>
<i>Because if the public knew this, </ i> <i>it wouldn' t look very good. </ i>
I need a big, black marker "? </ i>
<i>In early 2004, in a speech during</ i> <i>the New Hampshire primary... </ i> <i>...
I called George W. Bush</ i> <i>a deserter... </ i> <i>... from his time</ i> <i>in the Texas Air National Guard. </ i>
<i>In response, the White House</ i> <i>released his military records... </ i> <i>... in the hopes of disproving</ i> <i>the charge. </ i>
<i>What Bush didn' t know is</ i> <i>that I already had a copy... </ i> <i>... of his military records, uncensored, </ i> <i>obtained in the year 2000. </ i>
<i>And there is one glaring difference</ i> <i>between the records released... </ i> <i>... in 2000 and those he released</ i> <i>in 2004. </ i>
<i>A name had been blacked out. </ i>
<i>In 1972, two airmen were suspended</ i> <i>for failing to take... </ i> <i>... their medical examination. </ i>
<i>One was George W. Bush. </ i>
<i>And the other was James R. Bath. </ i>
<i>In 2000, the documents show</ i> <i>both names. </ i>
<i>But in 2004, Bush and the White</ i> <i>House had Bath' s name blacked out. </ i>
<i>Why didn' t Bush want the press</ i> <i>and the public... </ i> <i>... to see Bath' s name</ i> <i>on his military records? </ i>
<i>Perhaps he was worried that the</ i> <i>American people would find out... </ i> <i>... that at one time, James R. Bath... </ i> <i>... was the Texas money manager</ i> <i>for the bin Ladens. </ i>
<i>Bush and Bath had become</ i> <i>good friends... </ i> <i>... when they both served in the</ i> <i>Texas Air National Guard. </ i>
Bath opened up his own aviation</ i> <i>business after selling a plane... </ i> <i>... to a man by the name</ i> <i>of Salem bin Laden... </ i> <i>... heir to the second- largest fortune</ i> <i>in Saudi Arabia... </ i> <i>... the Saudi Binladin Group. </ i>
W. At that time was just starting off in the world as a businessman.
Because he' s a guy who' s always tried to emulate his father...... he went into the oil business.
He founded an oil company, Arbusto...... which was very good at drilling dry holes that nothing came out of.
But the question has always been, "Where did this money come from?"
Now, his dad was rich.
His dad could have done this for him...... but his dad didn' t do this for him.
There' s no indication Daddy wrote a check to start him off in his company.
<i>So where did George W. Bush</ i> <i>get his money? </ i>
I' m George Bush.
<i>One person who did invest in him</ i> <i>was James R. Bath. </ i>
<i>Bush' s good friend, James Bath, </ i> <i>was hired by the bin Laden family... </ i> <i>... to manage their money in Texas</ i> <i>and invest in businesses. </ i>
<i>And James Bath himself, in turn, </ i> <i>invested in George W. Bush. </ i>
<i>Bush ran Arbusto into the ground... </ i> <i>... as he did every other company</ i> <i>he was involved in... </ i> <i>... until finally one of his companies</ i> <i>was bought by Harken Energy... </ i> <i>... and they gave him a seat</ i> <i>on their board. </ i>
A lot of us suspected through the years that there has been...... Saudi oil money involved in these companies:
Harken, Spectrum 7, Arbusto Drilling, all the Bush companies.
Whenever they got in trouble, there were these angel investors...... who flowed money into the companies.
The question is, why would Saudis, who had all the oil in the world...... go around the globe to invest in this lousy oil company?
And the thing is, Harken had one big thing going for it...... which is that George W. Bush was on its board of directors...... at a time when his father was president of the United States.
Access is power.
And I can find my dad and talk to him any time of the day.
<i>Yes, it helps</ i> <i>to be the president' s son... </ i> <i>... especially when you' re being</ i> <i>investigated... </ i> <i>... by the Securities and Exchange</ i> <i>Commission. </ i>
In 1990, when Mr. Bush was a director of Harken Energy...... he received this memo from company lawyers...... warning directors not to sell stock if they had...... unfavorable information about the company.
One week later, he sold $848, 000 worth of Harken stock.
Two months later, Harken announced losses of more than $23 million.
<i>The James Baker law partner</ i> <i>who helped Bush... </ i> <i>... beat the rap from the SEC... </ i> <i>... was a man by the name</ i> <i>of Robert Jordan... </ i> <i>... who, when George W. Became</ i> <i>president... </ i> <i>... was appointed ambassador</ i> <i>to Saudi Arabia. </ i>
<i>After the Harken debacle, the friends</ i> <i>of Bush' s dad got him a seat... </ i> <i>... on another board, of a company</ i> <i>owned by the Carlyle Group. </ i>
We looked at which companies gained from September 11 th.
We turned up this company, Carlyle Group, a multinational conglomerate...... that invests in heavily government- regulated industries...... like telecommunications, health care and particularly, defense.
Both George W. Bush and George H. W. Bush...... worked for the Carlyle Group, the same company that counted...... the bin Laden family among its investors.
The Carlyle Group was holding its annual investor conference...... on the morning of September 11 th...... in the Ritz- Carlton Hotel in Washington D. C.
At that meeting were all of the Carlyle regulars...... James Baker, likely John Major, definitely George H. W. Bush...... though he left the morning of September 11 th.
Shafiq bin Laden, who is Osama bin Laden' s half brother...... was in town to look after his family' s investments in the Carlyle Group.
All of them together in one room, watching...... as the planes hit the towers.
In fact, the bin Laden family was invested...... in one of their defense funds, which ironically meant...... that as the U. S. Increased defense spending, the bin Laden family...... stood to gain from those investments through the Carlyle Group.
Our commander in chief, President George W. Bush.
<i>With all the weapons companies</ i> <i>it owned... </ i> <i>... the Carlyle Group was, in essence, </ i> <i>the 11 th largest... </ i> <i>... defense contractor</ i> <i>in the United States. </ i>
- Thanks a lot.
- <i>It owned United Defense... </ i> <i>... makers of the Bradley armored</ i> <i>fighting vehicle. </ i>
<i>September 11 th guaranteed that</ i> <i>United Defense... </ i> <i>... was going to have</ i> <i>a very good year. </ i>
Carlyle filed to take</ i> <i>United Defense public... </ i> <i>... and made a one- day profit</ i> <i>of $237 million. </ i>
<i>But sadly, with so much attention</ i> <i>focused... </ i> <i>... on the bin Laden family being</ i> <i>important Carlyle investors... </ i> <i>... the bin Ladens eventually</ i> <i>had to withdraw. </ i>
<i>Bush' s dad, though, stayed on</ i> <i>as senior adviser... </ i> <i>... to Carlyle' s Asia board</ i> <i>for another two years. </ i>
As unseemly as it seems to know that George H. W. Bush...... was meeting with the bin Laden family...... while Osama was a wanted terrorist, well before September 11 th...... it' s very discomforting for Americans to know that.
George H. W. Bush is a man who has, obviously, incredible reach...... into the White House.
He receives daily ClA briefings, which is the right of any ex- president...... but very few ex- presidents actually exercise that right.
And, I think, in a very real way they are benefiting from the confusion...... that arises when George H. W. Bush visits Saudi Arabia...... on behalf of Carlyle and meets with the royal family...... and meets with the bin Laden family.
Is he representing the United States of America?
Or is he representing an investment firm in the United States?
Or is he representing both?
This company is about money, not conspiracies to run the world...... or engineer political maneuvering and things like that.
It' s about making money, and it' s about making a lot of money.
And they' ve done very well.
I could get you on- the- record on this question.
In the White House view, there is no ethical conflict...... in former President Bush and former Secretary of State Jim Baker...... using their contacts with world leaders to represent...... one of the most well- known military arms dealers, the Carlyle Group?
The president has full faith that his family will conform...... with all proper ethics laws and will act properly in their conduct.
<i>Okay, let' s say one group of people, </ i> <i>like the American people... </ i> <i>... pay you $400, 000 a year</ i> <i>to be president of the United States. </ i>
<i>But then another group of people</ i> <i>invest in you, your friends... </ i> <i>... and their related businesses, </ i> <i>$ 1. 4 billion over a number of years. </ i>
<i>Who are you gonna like? </ i>
<i>Who' s your daddy? </ i>
<i>That' s how much the Saudi royals</ i> <i>and their associates... </ i> <i>... have given the Bush family, their</ i> <i>friends and their related businesses... </ i> <i>... in the past three decades. </ i>
Seems like a very nice reunion with friends.
<i>Is it rude to suggest</ i> <i>that when the Bush family... </ i> <i>... wakes up in the morning, </ i> <i>they might be thinking... </ i> <i>... about what' s best for the Saudis</ i> <i>instead of what' s best for you or me? </ i>
<i>Because 1. 4 billion just doesn' t buy</ i> <i>a lot of flights out of the country. </ i>
<i>It buys a lot of love. </ i>
<i>Sooner or later, </ i> <i>this special relationship... </ i> <i>... with a regime that Amnesty</ i> <i>International condemns... </ i> <i>... as a widespread human- rights</ i> <i>violator... </ i> <i>... would come back to haunt</ i> <i>the Bushes. </ i>
<i>Now, after 9/ 11, it was</ i> <i>an embarrassment. </ i>
<i>And they preferred that no one</ i> <i>ask any questions. </ i>
Investigation should have begun on September 12th.
There' s no reason it shouldn' t have.
Three thousand were dead.
It should' ve gotten started immediately.
<i>First, Bush tried to stop Congress</ i> <i>from setting up... </ i> - <i>... its own 9/ 11 investigation. </ i>
- It' s important for us...... to not reveal how we collect information.
That' s what the enemy wants.
And we' re fighting an enemy.
<i>When he couldn' t stop Congress, </ i> <i>he then tried to stop... </ i> <i>... an independent 9/ 11 commission</ i> <i>from being formed. </ i>
The president' s position was a break from history.
Independent investigations were launched after Pearl Harbor...... and President Kennedy' s assassination.
<i>But when Congress did complete</ i> <i>its own investigation... </ i> <i>... the Bush White House</ i> <i>censored 28 pages of the report. </ i>
The president is being pressed by all sides to declassify the report.
U. S. Officials tell NBC News most of the secret sources...... involve Saudi Arabia.
We' ve given extraordinary cooperation with Chairmen Kean and Hamilton.
We haven' t gotten the materials we needed...... and haven' t gotten them in a timely fashion.
Will you testify before the commission?
This commission?
You know, I don' t...
Testify?
I' d be glad to visit with them.
What it will do is, the hole that' s in my heart...... and has been in my heart since September 11 th...
I lost my husband of 15 years.
I am now by myself.
I need to know what happened to him.
I know what I got back from the autopsy.
That man was my life, and I have no plan.
I was taking a class, and they asked me...... what was I gonna do in the next five years.
And if I' m not doing something with this, I don' t know what reason...... I have to live.
So it' s very important.
Okay.
<i>Ignored by the Bush administration... </ i> <i>... more than 500 relatives</ i> <i>of 9/ 11 victims... </ i> <i>... filed suit against Saudi royals</ i> <i>and others. </ i>
<i>The lawyers the Saudi</ i> <i>defense minister hired... </ i> <i>... to fight the 9/ 11 families? </ i>
<i>The law firm of Bush family confidant, </ i> <i>James A. Baker. </ i>
So right here in the center of three important American landmarks...... the Watergate Hotel and office building...... the Kennedy Center over there...... and the embassy of Saudi Arabia.
Yeah.
How much money do the Saudis have invested in America, roughly?
I' ve heard figures as high as $860 billion.
- Eight hundred and sixty billion?
- Billion.
- That' s a lot of money.
- A lot, yeah.
And what percentage of our economy does that represent?
It seems like a lot.
Well, in terms of investments on Wall Street in American equities...... it' s roughly 6 or 7 percent of America.
They own a fairly good slice of America.
Most of that money goes into the great blue- chip companies.
Citigroup, Citibank, the largest stockholder is a Saudi.
AOL- Time Warner has big Saudi investors.
So I read where, like, the Saudis have a trillion dollars...... in our banks of their money.
What would happen...... if they pulled that trillion out?
A trillion dollars?
That would be an enormous blow to the economy.
Can I speak to you for a moment, please, sir?
- How are you doing?
- Good, how you doing?
Steve Kimball with the Secret Service.
We' re just ascertaining information.
Are you doing a documentary on the Saudi Arabian Embassy?
I am doing a documentary, and part of it is about Saudi Arabia.
<i>Even though we were nowhere near</ i> <i>the White House... </ i> <i>... the Secret Service had shown up</ i> <i>to ask us what we were doing... </ i> <i>... standing across the street</ i> <i>from the Saudi Embassy. </ i>
- We' re not here to cause any trouble.
- Okay.
- You know.
Is that...?
- No, that' s fine.
We just wanted to get some information as far as...
What' s going on, yeah.
I didn' t realize the Secret Service guards foreign embassies.
- No.
Do they give you any trouble?
- Saudis?
- No comment on that.
Okay, I' il take that as a yes.
Good.
Thank you very much.
<i>It turns out that Saudi Prince Bandar</ i> <i>is perhaps... </ i> <i>... the best- protected ambassador</ i> <i>in the U. S. </ i>
<i>The U. S. State Department provides</ i> <i>him with a six- man security detail. </ i>
<i>Considering how he and his family</ i> <i>and the Saudi elite... </ i> <i>... own 7 percent of America, </ i> <i>it' s probably not a bad idea. </ i>
<i>Prince Bandar was so close</ i> <i>to the Bushes... </ i> <i>... they considered him a member</ i> <i>of the family. </ i>
<i>Bandar Bush. </ i>
<i>Two nights after September 11 th, </ i> <i>George Bush invited Bandar Bush... </ i> <i>... over to the White House</ i> <i>for a private dinner and a talk. </ i>
<i>Even though bin Laden</ i> <i>was a Saudi... </ i> <i>... and Saudi money</ i> <i>had funded al Qaeda... </ i> <i>... and 15 of the 19 hijackers</ i> <i>were Saudis... </ i> <i>... here was the Saudi ambassador, </ i> <i>casually dining with the president... </ i> <i>... on September 13th. </ i>
<i>What were they talking about? </ i>
<i>Were they commiserating</ i> <i>or comparing notes? </ i>
<i>Why would Bandar' s government... </ i> <i>... block American investigators</ i> <i>from talking to the relatives... </ i> <i>... of the 15 hijackers? </ i>
<i>Why would Saudi Arabia</ i> <i>become reluctant... </ i> <i>... to freeze the hijackers' assets? </ i>
<i>The two of them walked out</ i> <i>on the Truman Balcony... </ i> <i>... so that Bandar could smoke a cigar</ i> <i>and have a drink. </ i>
<i>In the distance, across the Potomac, </ i> <i>was the Pentagon, partially in ruins. </ i>
<i>I wonder if Mr. Bush</ i> <i>told Prince Bandar not to worry... </ i> <i>... because he already had a plan</ i> <i>in motion. </ i>
You come in September 12th...... to plot our response to al Qaeda.
Let me talk about the response...... you got from top administration officials.
On that day, what did the president say to you?
The president, in a very intimidating way, left me and my staff...... with the clear indication he wanted us to come back...... with the word that there was an Iraqi hand behind 9<i>l</ i>11.
They planned to do something about Iraq before they came into office.
Did he ask about any other nations other than Iraq?
No, not at all.
It was, "Iraq, Saddam, find out, get back to me."
Were his questions more about Iraq than al Qaeda?
Absolutely.
He didn' t ask me about al Qaeda.
And the reaction you got from the defense secretary, Rumsfeld...... from his assistant, Paul Wolfowitz?
Donald Rumsfeld said...
When we talked about bombing...... the al Qaeda infrastructure in Afghanistan...... he said, "There are no good targets in Afghanistan.
Let' s bomb Iraq. "
And we said, "But Iraq had nothing to do with this."
That didn' t make much difference.
The reason they had...... to do Afghanistan first was, it was obvious al Qaeda attacked us.
And it was obvious that al Qaeda was in Afghanistan.
Americans wouldn' t stand by if we' d done nothing on Afghanistan.
<i>Mr.
Bush said he was doing so... </ i> <i>... because the Taliban government</ i> <i>of Afghanistan... </ i> <i>... had been harboring bin Laden. </ i>
We will smoke them out of their holes.
We' re gonna smoke them out.
- We' il smoke him out of his cave.
- Let' s rush them and smoke them out.
<i>For all his tough talk, </ i> <i>Bush really didn' t do much. </ i>
Well, what they did was slow and small.
They put only 11, 000 troops into Afghanistan.
There are more police here in Manhattan.
More in Manhattan than there are U. S. Troops in Afghanistan.
The president botched the response.
He should have gone after bin Laden.
The U. S. Special Forces didn' t get into the area where bin Laden was...... for two months.
- <i>Two months? </ i>
<i>A mass murderer who attacked</ i> <i>the United States... </ i> <i>... was given a two- month head start? </ i>
<i>Who in their right mind</ i> <i>would do that? </ i>
- Dang!
Anybody say "nice shot"?
- Nice shot.
Hell of a shot.
<i>Or was the war in Afghanistan</ i> <i>really about something else? </ i>
<i>Perhaps the answer</ i> <i>was in Houston, Texas. </ i>
<i>In 1997, while George W. Bush</ i> <i>was governor of Texas... </ i> <i>... a delegation of Taliban leaders</ i> <i>from Afghanistan flew to Houston... </ i> <i>... to meet with Unocal executives... </ i> <i>... to discuss the building of a pipeline</ i> <i>through Afghanistan... </ i> <i>... bringing natural gas</ i> <i>from the Caspian Sea. </ i>
<i>And who got a Caspian Sea</ i> <i>drilling contract... </ i> <i>... the same day Unocal</ i> <i>signed the pipeline deal? </ i>
<i>A company headed by a man</ i> <i>named Dick Cheney.
Halliburton. </ i>
From the point of view of the U. S. Government...... this was kind of a magic pipeline...... because it could serve so many purposes.
<i>And who else stood to benefit</ i> <i>from the pipeline? </ i>
<i>Bush' s number- one campaign</ i> <i>contributor, Kenneth Lay... </ i> <i>... and the good people of Enron. </ i>
<i>Only the British press</ i> <i>covered this trip. </ i>
<i>Then in 2001, just five and a half</ i> <i>months before 9/ 11... </ i> <i>... the Bush administration welcomed</ i> <i>a Taliban envoy... </ i> <i>... to tour the United States... </ i> <i>... to help improve the image</ i> <i>of the Taliban government. </ i>
You have imprisoned the women.
It' s a horror, let me tell you.
I' m sorry to your husband.
He must have a difficult time with you.
<i>Here is the Taliban official</ i> <i>visiting our State Department... </ i> <i>... to meet with U. S. Officials. </ i>
<i>Why would the Bush administration</ i> <i>allow a Taliban leader... </ i> <i>... to visit the United States, </ i> <i>knowing that the Taliban... </ i> <i>... were harboring the man</ i> <i>who bombed the</ i> U. S. S. Cole... <i>... and our African embassies? </ i>
<i>Well, I guess 9/ 11 put a stop to that. </ i>
<i>When the invasion of Afghanistan</ i> <i>was complete... </ i> <i>... we installed its new president, </ i> <i>Hamid Karzai. </ i>
<i>Who was Hamid Karzai? </ i>
<i>He was a former adviser to Unocal. </ i>
<i>Bush also appointed, </ i> <i>as our envoy to Afghanistan... </ i> <i>...
Zalmay Khalilzad, who was also</ i> <i>a former Unocal adviser. </ i>
<i>I guess you can probably see</ i> <i>where this is leading. </ i>
<i>Faster than you can say, "Black gold, </ i> <i>Texas tea," Afghanistan signed... </ i> <i>... an agreement with her</ i> <i>neighboring countries... </ i> <i>... to build a pipeline carrying</ i> <i>natural gas from the Caspian Sea. </ i>
<i>Oh, and the Taliban? </ i>
<i>Oh, they mostly got away. </ i>
<i>As did Osama bin Laden</ i> <i>and most of al Qaeda. </ i>
Terror is bigger than one person.
And he' s a person who' s now been marginalized.
So I don' t know where he is.
I just don' t spend that much time on him, to be honest with you.
<i>Didn' t spend much time on him? </ i>
<i>What kind of president was he? </ i>
I' m a war president.
I make decisions here in the Oval Office...... in foreign policy matters with war on my mind.
<i>The American people. </ i>
We' ve got an unusual terror warning from the feds to tell you about.
Fox News has obtained an FBI bulletin...... that warns terrorists could use pen guns, like in James Bond...... filled with poison.
- Good evening.
America is on high alert tonight, just four days before Christmas.
- A possible terror threat.
- As bad as or worse than 9<i>l</ i>11.
But where?
How?
There' s nothing specific to report.
Be on the lookout for model airplanes packed with explosives.
The FBI is warning ferries may be considered particularly at risk...... for hijacking.
Could these cattle be a target for terrorists?
- Fear does work, yes.
You can make people do anything if they' re afraid.
And how do you make them afraid?
Well, you make them afraid by creating an aura of endless threat.
They played us like an organ.
They raised the orange, up to red, then they dropped it back to orange.
I mean, they gave these mixed messages, which were crazy- making.
The world is changed after September the 11 th.
It' s changed because we' re no longer safe.
Fly and enjoy America' s great destination spots.
We have entered what may prove to be the most dangerous...... security environment the world' s known.
Take your families and enjoy life.
Terrorists are doing everything they can...... to gain even deadlier means of striking us.
- Go down to Disney World in Florida.
- It' s like training a dog.
You tell him sit down and roll over at the same time, dog doesn' t know...... what to do.
American people were being treated like that.
It was very, very skillfully and ugly, in what they did.
We must stop the terror.
I call upon all nations to do everything they can to stop these terrorist killers.
Thank you.
Now watch this drive.
All right.
You give me another one.
They will continue, in my view, as long as this administration is in charge...... of every once in a while, stimulating everybody to be afraid.
Just in case you forgot.
It' s not gonna go down to green or blue.
It' s never gonna get there.
There clearly is no way that anyone...... can live constantly on edge like that.
The reality facing American families...... is they' re not as safe as they used to be.
Drug dealers and users looking for their next fix.
Gangs who roam the streets in search of their next victim.
And the growing threat of terrorists means the need for protection...... is ever greater.
And now that protection is here.
Zytech Engineering, LLC has developed and tested a safe room...... finally affordable to the average American citizen.
Protection formerly obtainable only by the wealthy or powerful.
Heck, you can be sitting in here, drinking your finest Bordeaux...... and enjoying life, while chaos is erupting outside.
Every family in America should prepare itself...... for a terrorist attack.
Now to escaping from a skyscraper.
John Rivers is the CEO...... of the Executive Chute Corporation.
Good morning to you, John.
- Good morning, Matt.
- Tell me about the product.
It' s an option of last resort.
How high do you have to be in the building...... for that chute to actually take effect?
You only have to be on the 10th floor or above.
They can put this on themselves?
Right.
They can put this on themselves in as easy...... as about 30 seconds.
It' s real easy to put on.
- Here.
- Sorry.
That' s okay.
Real easy to put on, but...
When you first get this chute, you' re gonna wanna put it on...... and try it on a few times yourself.
- Jaime' s having trouble putting that on.
Is this something that you honestly think, in a moment of panic...... that someone can operate properly?
Oh, yeah.
This is actually...
Jamie' s probably never...... put this thing on before in her life.
It' s okay.
It' s something that, when you get it...... you' re gonna wanna put it on several times.
Despite the raising of the terror alert level, residents here continue...... with their Christmas errands.
Frances and her family do some last- minute holiday shopping...... knowing al Qaeda is planning to attack.
She says being in Saginaw doesn' t make her feel any safer...... than if she was in New York City.
Midland is close by...... and I said, "Detroit' s not that far away."
I said, "That could be something...
And Flint could be something...
Be...... concerns for people around here. "
- You never know...... where they' re gonna hit.
Never know.
But one potential target specifically mentioned by the terrorists...... has security officials baffled.
It' s tiny Tappahannock, Virginia...... population, 2016.
Such an attack could generate widespread fear...... that even here in rural, small- town America, no one is entirely safe.
On the news there was an alert in Tappahannock.
- What did the FBI tell you?
- Well, they contacted me by phone.
Basically let me know about this, were it Tappahannock.
- That' s how it started.
- In the so- called chatter they pick up...... they wasn' t sure Tappahannock.
There' s a Rappahannock County...... Rappahannock River.
- There is a Rappahannock...
A place called Rappahannock.
They got it mixed up.
This is Tappahannock, not Rappahannock.
- Is there any target around here?
- Not that we can think of.
- It can happen anywhere.
- Wal- Mart.
A big spaghetti supper in here.
Wal- Mart, probably.
Do you feel extra suspicious of outsiders?
Oh, everybody does that.
That' s just something that happens.
Do you think they could be a terrorist? "
- Never know what' s gonna happen.
- Right.
It could happen right now.
Never trust nobody you don' t know.
And even if you do know them, you really can' t trust them then.
<i>From Tappahannock</ i> <i>to Rappahannock... </ i> <i>... to every town and village in</ i> <i>America, the people were afraid. </ i>
<i>And they turned to their leader</ i> <i>to protect them. </ i>
<i>But protect them from what? </ i>
<i>Meet John Ashcroft. </ i>
<i>In 2000, he was running for</ i> <i>re- election as senator for Missouri... </ i> <i>... against a man who died</ i> <i>the month before the election. </ i>
<i>The voters preferred the dead guy. </ i>
<i>So George W. Bush made him</ i> <i>his attorney general. </ i>
<i>He was sworn in on a stack</ i> <i>of Bibles. </ i>
<i>Because when you can' t beat</ i> <i>a dead guy... </ i> <i>... you need all the help you can get. </ i>
Ashcroft told acting FBI director, </ i> <i>Thomas Pickard... </ i> <i>... that he didn' t want to hear</ i> <i>anything more about terrorist threats. </ i>
Mr. Watson had come to you and said that the ClA was very concerned...... that there would be an attack.
You said that you told the attorney general this fact repeatedly...... in these meetings.
That correct?
I' ve told him at least on two occasions.
And you told the staff, according to this statement...... Mr. Ashcroft told you that he did not want to hear about this anymore.
- Is that correct?
- That is correct.
<i>His own FBI knew that summer</ i> <i>there were al Qaeda members... </ i> <i>... in the U. S. And bin Laden was</ i> <i>sending his agents to flight schools... </ i> <i>... around the country. </ i>
<i>But Ashcroft' s Justice Department</ i> <i>turned a blind eye... </ i> <i>... and a deaf ear. </ i>
<i>But after 9/ 11, John Ashcroft</ i> <i>had some brilliant ideas... </ i> <i>... for how to protect America. </ i>
The Patriot Act, adopted by Congress and signed by Bush...... six weeks after the attacks...... has changed the way the government does business.
The Patriot Act allows for searches of medical and financial records...... computer and telephone conversations...... even for the books you take out of the library.
But people we spoke to...... say they' re willing to give up liberties to fight terrorism.
- Maybe that' s a good thing.
- It' s sad, but it has to be done.
<i>Yes, something needed to be done. </ i>
<i>These are the good people</ i> <i>who make up Peace Fresno. </ i>
<i>A community group</ i> <i>in Fresno, California. </ i>
<i>Unlike the rest of us, </ i> <i>they received an early lesson... </ i> <i>... in what the Patriot Act is all about. </ i>
<i>Each week, they meet to discuss</ i> <i>matters of peace. </ i>
<i>They sit around, they share stories, </ i> <i>they eat cookies. </ i>
<i>Some have more than one. </ i>
<i>This is Aaron Stokes, </ i> <i>a member of Peace Fresno. </ i>
<i>The other members liked him. </ i>
He had come to the meetings, he went with us.
We go out on Friday nights and stand on a very busy corner in Fresno.
And he had gone with us, he had handed out fliers.
He went with us in June to a WTO protest.
<i>Then one day, Aaron didn' t show up</ i> <i>to the meeting. </ i>
My friend Dan and I were reading the Sunday newspaper...... and when I picked up the paper, in the local section...... Aaron' s picture caught my eye.
The article said that a sheriff' s deputy had been killed...... and I saw it had a name that wasn' t the right name...... that said that he was a member of the sheriff' s antiterrorism unit.
<i>That' s right. </ i>
<i>The photo of the man</ i> <i>in the newspaper... </ i> <i>... was not the Aaron Stokes</ i> <i>they had come to know. </ i>
<i>He was actually Deputy Aaron Kilner, </ i> <i>and he had infiltrated their group. </ i>
Sheriff Pierce made it very clear that, yes...... Aaron Kilner was assigned to infiltrate Peace Fresno...... that he was able to infiltrate organizations...... that are open to the public.
<i>You could understand why the police</ i> <i>needed to spy... </ i> <i>... on a group like Peace Fresno. </ i>
<i>Just look at them. </ i>
<i>A gathering of terrorists</ i> <i>if I ever saw one. </ i>
<i>This is Barry Reingold, </ i> <i>a retired phone worker... </ i> <i>... from Oakland, California. </ i>
<i>Barry likes to work out in the gym. </ i>
Barry got political. </ i>
We were up in the gym, and it was after we were working out...... and a number of us were talking about 9<i>l</ i>11 and Afghanistan...... and bin Laden, and someone said, "Bin Laden' s a real asshole...... for murdering those people."
And I said, "Yeah, that' s true.
But he' il never be as big an asshole as Bush...... who bombs all over the world for oil profits. "
<i>Barry didn' t have to worry</ i> <i>about the police spying on him. </ i>
<i>His fellow weightlifters</ i> <i>were more than willing to turn him in. </ i>
And they came to my place, and I said, "Well, who' s there?"
And they said, "The FBl."
I said, "The FBl?
Why are they here? "
<i>Yes, the FBI had come to see Barry. </ i>
<i>And they weren' t there to Jazzercise. </ i>
The FBI said, "Have you been talking to people about 9<i>l</ i>11 and bin Laden...... and oil profits and Afghanistan?"
I said, "A lot of people are talking...... about these things."
I feel my rights have been, you know, trampled on.
I mean, if you have something to say to me in the gym, well, then, fine.
Don' t tell the FBl, and they come to my apartment while I' m taking a nap.
Abenader...
Do as they wish.
I am your servant, Father.
Your servant, and the son of Your handmaid.
Why do you embrace your cross, fool?
All right, your highness, let' s move!
Help me get near him.
This way.
This way, Mother.
Mother...
Mother...
I' m here...
I' m here...
See, Mother, I make all things new.
Who is that?
Who?
She' s the Galilean' s mother.
Let' s go.
Come on!
Don' t fret, my daughter.
Don' t fret.
Are you blind?
Can' t you see, he can' t go on?
Help him!
You!
Yes, you!
Get over here!
What do you want from me?
This criminal can' t carry his cross by himself anymore.
You will help him!
Now get going!
I can' t do that.
It' s none of my business.
Get someone else!
Help him!
He is a holy man.
Now move!
Let' s go!
All right, but remember...... l' m an innocent man, forced to carry the cross of a condemned man.
Stay here.
Wait for me.
Permit me, my Lord.
Who do you think you are?
Get away from here.
Impossible people!
Someone stop this!
Stop!
Stop!
Leave him alone!
If you don' t stop, I won' t carry that cross one more step.
I don' t care what you do to me!
All right, all right, let' s get moving.
We don' t have all day.
Let' s go!
Let' s go...... Jew!
Almost there.
We' re nearly there.
Almost done.
You have heard it said...... you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.
But I say to you...... love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you...
For if you love only those who love you...
... what reward is there in that?
I am the good shepherd.
I lay down my life for my sheep.
No one takes my life from me...... but I lay it down of my own accord.
I have power to lay it down...... and power to take it up again.
This command is from my Father.
Get away now, you' re free to go.
Go on!
You can get up now!
Get up, your majesty.
Can' t you get up?
We haven' t got all day.
Come on, move!
We' re ready.
Get up, your highness.
You are my friends.
There is no greater love than for a man to lay down his life for his friends.
I cannot be with you much longer, my friends.
You cannot go where I am going.
My commandment to you after I am gone is this...
Love one another.
As I have loved you...... so love one another.
You believe in me.
You know that I am the Way...... the Truth, and the Life.
And no one comes to the Father but by me.
Further out...
Idiots!
Let me show you how to do it.
Like this!
No, get in there.
Hold the hand open like this.
Father, forgive them...
Father...... Father my Father... my God...
They don' t know... they don' t know...
Stupid mongrels!
Turn the wood over on its face, idiots!
Take this and eat.
This is my body which is given up for you.
Take this and drink.
This is my blood of the new covenant...... which is given for you and for many, for the forgiveness of sins.
Do this in memory of me.
If you are the son of God, why don' t you save yourself?
Prove to us...... you are who you say you are.
You said you could destroy the temple...... and rebuild it in three days...... and yet you cannot come down from that cross.
If he is the Messiah...... I say let him come down from the cross...... so that we may see and believe.
Father, forgive them...... they know not what they do.
Listen...... he prays for you.
We deserve this, Gesmas...... but he does not.
I have sinned...... and my punishment is just.
You would be justified in condemning me.
I ask only that you remember me, Lord...... when you enter your kingdom.
Amen, I tell you...
... on this day you shall be with me...
... in paradise.
I thirst.
Flesh of my flesh...... heart of my heart...
My son, let me die with you.
Woman...... behold your son.
Son, behold...
... your mother.
There is no one left.
No one, Jesus!
My God...
... why have you forsaken me?
It is accomplished.
Father, into your hands...... I commend... my spirit.
Cassius!
Hurry!
He' s dead!
Make sure!
Tell him to do anything it takes to punish Himmler.
We' ve decided to die with you.
Thank you for this proof of loyalty.
But Himmler must die.
He committed treason.
He' s no longer privvy to my plans.
Mein Führer?
Do you think I' il sit and wait until those Jewish swine slaughter me?
This is part of a huge decoy manoeuvre.
I' ve allowed the enemy...... to invade the Reich and they think they' ve won.
Dönitz is mobilising in the north.
Kesselring in the south.
We' il surround the enemy and crush them.
From Prague, three armies will attack the Russians, simultaneously, from the back.
I didn' t know we still had so many reserve troops.
I made sure you' il soon have a 1000 of the most modern...... jets at your disposal.
With those, you can make the Luftwaffe ready for battle again.
I kneel to your genius, at the altar of the motherland.
Heil, mein Führer.
You also request to leave Berlin?
Mein Führer, as you know, all medical departments...... that fall under the SS and Himmler, have left Berlin.
Himmler is a traitor.
He won' t escape punishment.
Mein Führer, as Reichsarzt SS, I have no more work here.
Your request to leave Berlin is unacceptable.
My family...
If the Russians...
I must leave.
You did nothing wrong.
Future generations will thank you for you medical research.
I take all the responsibility.
We' il talk about it later.
Gruppenführer Fegelein cannot be found.
He' s not in the bunker.
What, you can' t find Fegelein?
Keep searching.
I need to talk to him.
Immediately.
If he left just like that, that' s desertion.
Treason.
Bring me Fegelein.
Fegelein.
Fegelein.
Daddy, why are you wearing your Sunday uniform?
Ernst, is something wrong?
- No.
Thank you.
Brigitte is hungry too.
Ilse, you should eat something as well.
Thank you.
- There you go.
Thank you.
What is it?
- Gruppenführer, you' re under arrest.
What?
- You' re suspected of desertion.
Get dressed.
You' il come with us.
Search the room.
Let go of me.
You can' t give me orders.
You can' t have Hermann executed, can you?
There' s no doubt.
He wanted to flee.
What does it matter?
Everything' s over.
Think of my poor sister.
She' s pregnant by Hermann.
He collaborated with Himmler.
He' s a traitor.
There' s no mercy for traitors.
No compassion for them.
He' il be court- martialled and executed.
What' s the point of that?
It is my wish.
You' re the Führer.
Speak.
The Russians are advancing more and more.
There are no more reserves.
Supplies from the air are impossible.
There is no ammunition coming in anymore.
In the north, the Russians are standing in front of the Weidendammer bridge.
In the east:
Lustgarten.
South:
Potsdammer Platz.
West:
Tiergarten, about 400 metres away from the chancellery.
How long can you hold out?
- At most, two days.
Including the government area?
- Yes.
As a soldier, I suggest we flee Berlin.
It' s surrounded.
The battle of Berlin killed about 20, 000 of our best officers.
That' s what young people are for.
What you suggest is insane.
Ridiculous.
Think of the thousands of wounded.
We can' t help them.
Mein Führer, the orders have been written.
I give you my word...
The Führer cannot make a honourless disappearance from world history.
Even if an advance is successful...... I' il end up in another troublesome situation.
I' d have to stay in the open air or on a farm...... and wait for the end.
Wenck is advancing with the 12th army.
He can join the 9th...... and give the Russians the final blow.
Wenck' s an excellent fellow.
Send a telegram to Keitel:
Immediately report to me the following:
Where are Wenck' s vanguard located?
2.
When will they attack again?
3.
Where is the 9th army?
4.
Where will the 9th make a breakthrough?
You' il see, gentlemen.
I' il be right.
Wenck will come.
Wenck will come.
I want to know if Wenck can do anything at all.
It' s unlikely that Wenck' s small amount of troops...
What' s unlikely about the offensive?
- Wenck can' t do anything anymore.
Then why don' t you tell the Führer that?
Has everybody gone mad?
Do you think the Führer doesn' t know?
He' il never surrender.
I' ve been through that once.
Never again.
Come along.
I have to go.
Stop right there.
Heil Hitler.
Excuse me.
I fell asleep.
Did you get some rest, my child?
In shorthand.
During those 30 years, I learnt to think, act and live...... out of love and loyalty for my people.
Excuse me.
The shooting.
- Please sit down.
International Judaism and its allies.
What is it, Herr Minister?
Imagine this.
The Führer wants me to leave Berlin.
He ordered it.
I' ve never ignored an order from the Führer.
But I will ignore this order.
I' il stay with the Führer.
Please, Frau Junge...... I want to dictate my will to you.
I' m typing the Führer' s will.
Good.
I understand.
Some other time.
Mein Führer, according to the racial law I' m obliged to ask you:
Mein Führer, are you of Aryan descent?
Can I see your identity card?
You' re talking to the Führer here.
- Alright then.
And you, Fräulein Braun, are you of Aryan descent?
Then there' s nothing to stop us.
I' m asking you now:
Do you, mein Führer, Adolf Hitler...... take Eva Braun, present here, as your wife?
Answer 'yes'.
Do you, Eva Braun, take Führer Adolf Hitler, present here...... as your husband?
Answer 'yes'.
Then I declare you man and wife.
Two men here.
Everything will be alright.
You must go to the Führer right away.
- Now?
How long can we hold out?
- Twenty hours, no more.
The Russians are close.
At the moment, we forced them to stop.
The western democracies are decadent.
They' il succumb to the people from the east.
All the best.
Thank you.
It wasn' t just for Germany.
A message from Keitel.
1.
Wenck' s vanguard are stuck south of Schwielowsee.
3.
What do we do when the last ammunition reserves have been exhausted?
I' il never surrender.
Never.
I forbid you, and the other commanders, to surrender.
Listen, Günsche.
My wife and I are going to commit suicide.
I don' t want my corpse exposed by the Russians.
I don' t want them to get me, dead or alive.
I want to be burnt and never to be found.
Günsche, I want you to promise me...... that you will do all that it takes.
Mein Führer...... this is a terrible order, but I will execute it.
Kempka.
- Erich, I need 200 litres of petrol.
Are you mad?
Where should I find them?
From the parked vehicles.
What' s all that petrol for?
- I can' t say.
Come, please.
The Führer wants to see us.
Should I tell the Führer you' re indisposed?
It' s only my collapsed lung.
I' il die soon anyway.
Excuse me.
Over here, Herr Professor.
One moment, please.
Excuse me.
I' m sorry to interrupt your important work.
Mein Führer, keep faith in the final victory.
Lead us and we shall follow.
Come along.
Join the gang.
Come.
Have a drink.
Besides drinking, there' s little we can do.
- Do sit down.
That' s better.
Yes, the situation is pretty shitty.
Can we sit down?
- Please do, Fräulein...
Frau...
- That' s Frau Hitler.
It' s alright.
A pity we can' t go outside anymore.
Only if you want to die a heroic death.
Fritz, control yourself a bit.
- Yes.
Control.
Take cover.
What are you doing here?
- I have to report to the Führer.
You can' t right now.
Sit down.
Sit.
Drink.
Let me introduce Frau Hitler.
So young and so many decorations.
You must be proud.
Excuse me.
I' m not used to drinking anymore.
You can use our toilet.
If your hand shakes, the bullet might only hit an optic nerve.
That' s why it' s good to also take the poison.
When you bite through the capsule, pull the trigger.
Will I have enough time?
The poison starts working after one or two seconds.
Tornow, you too.
Come Blondi.
You know, Frau Junge, I' ve known... my husband for more than 15 years.
But when I think about it, I know nothing about him.
Even though he likes to talk.
I longed for Berlin, but he' s so different now.
He only talks about dogs and vegetarian food now.
I hate Blondi.
I sometimes kick her and Adolf then wonders why she acts strange.
I think he doesn' t want anybody to really know him.
... he can be so caring in his private life.
And then he uses that rude language again.
When he' s the Führer, you mean?
Come, let' s smoke another one.
I' m sorry.
You have so many worries and here I am, whining.
Frau Junge, I' m giving you this coat as a goodbye present.
I like fashionable ladies.
I want you to enjoy it.
What a surprise.
Thank you.
I just don' t know where and when I can wear it.
Please, try to get out of here.
Promise me.
Thank you.
That was very good, Fräulein Manziarly.
The time has come.
It' s finished.
The Führer wants to say goodbye.
Come with me.
You' re the bravest mother of the Reich.
Führer, you made me the happiest woman in Germany.
Salute my beautiful Bavaria.
Children, what are you doing here?
We want to see aunt Eva and uncle Hitler.
Have you eaten anything yet?
- Only breakfast.
Stay here, I' il get something to eat.
I' il be right back.
Comrades, this is the latest news from the outside.
Berlin is full of warehouses:
There were houses here, there were houses there.
Herr Günsche, I want to speak to the Führer.
Please, I have to.
Frau Goebbels, the Führer doesn' t want to be disturbed.
Please, Günsche, just for a moment.
Please.
Mein Führer, Frau Goebbels is here.
What is it?
Mein Führer, I beg you:
Leave Berlin.
Don' t leave us Führer.
What will become of us?
Tomorrow, I' il be cursed by millions, but that' s how it is.
Get up.
Come.
Come.
Aunt Traudl, I like it when it thunders.
Why?
- Nothing can happen to us here.
Can it?
- No.
Gotcha.
Reichsleiter, it' s over.
The Führer is dead.
There' s daddy.
Are you crazy?
For that damned petrol of yours...
Erich, shut up.
Stand back.
Come on, continue.
Continue.
No, don' t.
Let grandpa go.
Order.
We must have order.
Order has to return.
This way.
We know the way.
You can trust us.
Hurry.
I was on the side of the Red Beasts.
I supported the Bolsheviks.
Let' s hope the Russians got our message.
We' il soon find out.
- Or not.
What news do you have, General?
Adolf Hitler and his wife committed suicide in the bunker.
The new government authorised me...... to start peace talks...... between our countries, that both suffered severe losses.
General, if you were me, would you make peace with you?
My government will never accept unconditional surrender.
Given the situation, you have no other choice.
Surrender?
Never.
That' s shameful.
Years ago, I conquered Berlin on the Reds...... and I' il defend the city to my dying day.
In the short time I have as Chancellor...... I' il never sign a surrender treaty.
It' s for the sake of the people.
- The Führer' s orders are final.
This is crazy.
We have to start negotiations.
I repeat, gentlemen:
I do not surrender.
Send a message to Marshal Zhukov.
- Zhukov?
What' s happening?
- We' re surrendering.
Then I must kill you.
The Führer forbids any surrender.
How long does it work?
- Around four hours.
Children, the doctor has the medication I told you about.
It' s a bit bitter, but it will work.
A sip for everybody.
Who wants to go first?
Heide, you' re always so brave?
Have another sip.
See?
That wasn' t so bad.
Well done.
Helmut.
This medication makes sure you don' t get ill in this humid bunker.
But it' s not humid in the bunker.
Well done.
Helga.
I don' t want to.
What' s that?
Do you want to get sick?
I don' t want to drink it.
Don' t cry, baby.
That doesn' t help.
You have to drink the medicine.
Helga.
Come on, open your mouth.
Goodnight, children.
One day the lie will fall apart...... and there will be light in the darkness.
Let' s do it differently.
We don' t stand a chance.
- So what?
I want to get away.
How do we get through the lines?
Doesn' t matter.
I' m not staying another minute.
We' il die.
- It won' t be that bad, surely.
If we stay, the Russians will get us for sure.
All the best.
Come, let' s go.
I hereby declare an immediate cease- fire.
A glass of water, please.
I don' t need you anymore.
The game' s over.
It' s time.
- Don' t you see what' s going on here?
I insist that you help us, as a doctor.
Alright, then.
Go.
You did a lot.
Thank you.
Come on.
- I' m not going anywhere anymore.
Come along.
Are you alright?
- Keep going.
Sturmmann Krüger and his group defended the Wolf Bridge...... and he receives the Iron Cross.
Sturmmann Wagner took out two machine- gun nests...... and therefore, receives the Iron Cross.
Sturmmann Rauch has gotten messages through the lines...... and receives the Iron Cross.
The others are coming.
Take cover, Müiler.
Who' s that?
A German.
Herr Hewel?
Thank God, you' re alive.
Where are the others?
I don' t know, Frau Junge.
Somewhere.
Maybe.
Most people from my group must be dead.
I should never have left that bunker.
I should have shot myself, but I couldn' t.
Eat something first.
There' s always enough time to die.
You stay with the women.
Come along.
The Russians have surrounded us.
- What' s going to happen to us?
Maybe you can get through.
You could try.
I' m not taking another step.
Think about it.
The Russians are after us.
As a woman, you might have a chance.
Try it.
Good luck.
When you walk past the Russians, don' t look them in the eyes.
All the best.
The Russians.
Gerda, let' s go.
- You go.
I' m exhausted.
- Please.
I have to give it a try.
Don' t be angry with me.
I' il be alright.
Herr Doktor.
My comrades want to surrender.
Can I join you?
The Führer' s dead.
Do you want to continue the war on your own?
I' m obliged by my oath.
Then you' d better go to the Brigadeführer.
The Russians are evacuating the square.
- So?
No opposition.
No shooting.
Then they' il be here within the hour.
What shall we do?
We can' t surrender.
- What exactly do you mean?
When the Russians come, we' il empty our weapons on them.
The last bullets are for ourselves.
- That' s radical.
Is this prestigious murder and suicide our only option?
We' re SS officers.
We can' t survive the Führer.
Who agrees with me?
Come and sit down with me?
- Please.
Why do you want to continue living?
- And you?
Why do you want to die?
See this?
The Führer gave it to me personally.
As a last decoration?
- Maybe.
A goodbye present from Hitler.
I had to promise him something.
If the Russians get me, I have to kill myself.
Did he make you promise that?
But why?
Maybe he didn' t want me to be forced...... to say anything bad about him.
But, as a diplomat, you' re under international protection.
Who will benefit if you stick to your deal?
There they are.
Don' t shoot, comrades.
We surrendered.
The war is over.
It' s over.
The war took the lives of more than 50 million people.
She died in Düsseldorf on 14 April 1997.
Dr. Schenck was released in 1953 by the Soviets.
Wilhelm Mohnke was released by the Soviets in 1955.
Werner Haase was arrested in the bunker, by the Red Army.
Robert Ritter von Greim committed suicide on 24 May 1945.
Hentschel was released in 1949 and died in 1982.
He still lives in Berlin.
All the horror I heard about during the Nuremberg trial...... the 6 million Jews, dissidents or people of another race...... who died, shocked me deeply.
But I hadn' t made the connection with my own past yet.
I reassured myself by thinking I wasn' t personally guilty of it.
And that I hadn' t known about the sheer size of it.
But one day, I walked past a commemorative plaque...... for Sophie Scholl, here in the Franz- Joseph- Strasse.
I saw that she was my age...... and that she was executed in the year I joined Hitler.
And only then did I realise... that youth is no excuse.
And that it might have been possible to find out the truth.
Help here!
Anyone!
- Constable Crane?
Is that you?
- None other.
Not only me.
I found something which was lately a man.
- Burn it.
- Yes, sir.
- We do not know the cause of death.
- If found in the river, it is drowning.
We might determine whether he was dead before he went into the river.
- I will need to examine the body.
Are we heathens?
- What happened to him?
- Arrested for burglary.
good work. he millennium is almost upon us.
In a few months, we will be living in the 19th century.
Yet our courts rely on medieval methods of torture.
- Stand down!
- I stand up, for sense and justice.
Our jails overflow with men convicted on confessions worth no more...
Constable Crane!
This is a song we have heard from you more than once.
There are two courses open to me.
First, I can let you cool your heels in the cells, -
- until you learn respect for the dignity of my office...
Why am I the only one who sees that to solve crimes, detect the guilty, -
- we must use our brains to find clues, using up- to- date scientific techniques?
Which brings me to the second course.
There is a town upstate, two days to the north, in the Hudson Highlands.
It is a place called Sleepy Hollow.
- Have you heard of it?
- I have not.
An isolated farming community, mainly Dutch.
Three persons have been murdered, all within a fortnight.
Each one found with the head lopped off.
- Clean as dandelion heads, apparently.
You will take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow, -
- and there you will detect the murderer.
Bring him here to face our good justice.
- Will you do this?
- I shall.
- who is now put to the test.
The pickety witch, the pickety witch, who' s got a kiss for the pickety witch?
- Is it Theodore?
- I am only a stranger.
Then have a kiss on account.
I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.
I am his daughter, Katrina.
- We have not heard your name yet.
- I have not said it.
Excuse me.
- You need some manners!
- We' il have no raised voices.
It is to raise spirits in this dark time that I and my wife are giving this party.
You are welcome, even if you are selling something.
Constable Ichabod Crane, sent from New York to investigate the murders.
Then Sleepy Hollow is grateful to you.
We hope you will honour us by remaining in this house.
Come sir, we' il get you settled.
Play on!
Excuse me.
Thank you.
Please tell Mr. Van Tassel I will be down in a moment.
I will, sir.
Thank God you' re here.
Ah, excellent, come in.
Leave us, my dear.
We are joined by Dr Thomas Lancaster, Reverend Steenwyck, -
- our able magistrate Samuel Philipse, -
- and lastly, this fine fellow is James Hardenbrook, our notary.
- And you, sir?.
- A simple farmer who has prospered.
The town looks to me as friend and counsel.
And landlord and banker.
So, three persons murdered...
First, Peter Van Garrett...... and his son, Dirk Van Garrett.
Both of them strong, capable men, -
- found together... decapitated.
One week later, the Widow Winship.
Also decapitated.
Now, I will need to ask you many questions, -
- but first let me ask, is anyone suspected?
How much have your superiors explained to you?
Only that the three were slain in open ground, -
- their heads found severed from their bodies.
Their heads were not found severed.
- The heads are gone?
- Taken.
Taken by the Headless Horseman.
Taken back to hell.
- Pardon, I don' t...
- Perhaps you had better sit down.
Yes.
The Horseman was a Hessian mercenary, -
- sent by a German princess to keep Americans under the yoke of England.
But unlike his compatriots, who came for money, -
- the Horseman came for love of carnage.
When battle was joined, there you' d find him.
He rode a giant black steed named Daredevil.
He rode hard into battle, chopping off heads at full gallop.
He had filed his teeth down to sharp points, -
- to add to the ferocity of his appearance.
This butcher didn' t finally reach his end until the winter of '79.
Not far from here, in our western woods.
They chopped off his head with his own sword.
Even today the woods -
- is a haunted place, where brave men will not venture.
For what was planted in the ground that day -
- was a seed of evil.
And so it has been for 20 years.
But now the Hessian wakes, cutting off heads where he finds them.
Are you saying...
Is that what you believe?
Seeing is believing.
They tell me you' ve brought books of scientific investigation.
This is the only book I recommend you read.
Reverend Steenwyck, gentlemen...
Murder needs no ghost to come from the grave.
We have murders in New York without benefit of ghouls and goblins.
You' re far from New York.
The assassin is a man of flesh and blood, and I will discover him.
Come out, devil.
- His name' s Gunpowder.
- He should do just fine.
Thank you.
You need any help, you call my name.
Don' t you worry about a thing.
Everything will be just fine.
Thomas, inside!
Kiss your mother once for you and twice for me.
Murder!
The Horseman' s killed again!
All right, Gunpowder, we' re off.
No, no, the other way.
Good horse.
Mr. Miller, ride back for the coffin- cart.
The rest of you, keep a sharp lookout.
It' s all right.
The fourth victim, Jonathan Masbath.
Yes, I see.
And the head..?
- Taken.
- Interesting.
Very interesting.
In cases like this, the head is removed to prevent identification of the body.
- But we know this was Masbath.
- Precisely.
So why was it removed?
- Why?.
- Right.
You have moved the body?.
You must never move the body!
- Why not?
- Because.
The stride is gigantic!
The attacker rode Masbath down.
Turned his horse.
Came back to claim the head.
There' s a chemical reaction.
It was a powerfull singular thrust to the neck.
- Interesting.
The wound was cauterised, as though the blade were red- hot.
And yet, no blistering, no scorched flesh.
The Devil' s fire.
"Be vigilant", as it sayeth in the Book of Peter, chapter five, verse eight.
"Because your adversary, the Devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, -
- seeking whom he may devour. "
God rest, Jonathan Masbath.
- Mr. Constable, sir.
- You' re young Masbath.
I was young Masbath, but now the only one.
Masbath at your service.
In honour, bound to avenge my father.
Well, I thank you very much, but your mother will need you more than l.
She has my father now to care for her.
But you have no one to serve you.
I am your man, sir.
And a brave one, too.
But I cannot be the one to look after you.
I am sorry for your loss, young Mr. Masbath.
Constable Crane!
There' s something you should know.
Jonathan Masbath was not the fourth victim, but the fifth.
- The fifth?
- Aye.
Five victims in four graves.
Masbath, find a place in Van Tassel' s servants' quarters.
Wake me at dawn.
I hope you have a strong stomach.
Peter Van Garrett, Dirk Van Garrett.
Jonathan Masbath.
Five victims, four graves.
The Widow Winship.
Bring the widow in.
- This is most irregular, Constable.
- Yes, but in this case necessary.
- I need to operate immediately.
She' s dead.
I mean, of course, I will need the operating table.
Once more, the neck wound cauterised, -
- the sword thrust to the stomach the same, but to what purpose?
To what is your purpose, is the question.
- What type of instruments are these?
- Some of my own design.
Step out, young Masbath.
Thank you for your help, Mr. Killian.
And if you don' t mind, Doctor, -
- my concentration suffers greatly when I' m observed.
- I am finished.
- What have you done to her?.
- We are dealing with a madman.
- What did you find out?
The Widow Winship was with child.
Who' s there?
- Oh, pardon my intrusion.
- There' s no intrusion.
I come here to read when I' m wakeful.
- To read books which you must hide.
- They were my mother' s books.
My father believes tales of romance caused the brain fever that killed her.
The nurse who cared for her during her sickness is now Lady Van Tassel.
Why did no one mention that the Van Garretts are kin to the Van Tassels?
Hardly a household is not connected to every other by blood or marriage.
I see.
This was Van Garrett land, given to father when I wore swaddling clothes.
They were the richest family.
When my father brought me here, -
- Van Garrett gave him an acre and a broken- down cottage.
My father worked hard and prospered.
I owe Van Garrett my happiness.
I remember living poor in the cottage.
- Should I show you?
- Yes.
- Take this.
It is my gift for you.
- No, I have no use for it.
Are you so certain of everything?
- It was your mother' s.
- It is sure protection against harm.
Are you so certain of everything?
What are these strange markings?
I' ve had them since I can remember.
I used to play by this hearth as a child.
It was my first drawing school.
My mother was my teacher.
Look.
See?
Carved into the fireback.
The archer.
I' d forgotten it.
This was from long before we lived here.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, thank you.
A cardinal.
I' d love to have a tame one, but I wouldn' t have the heart to cage it.
Well, then I have something for you.
Cardinal on one side, an empty cage.
And now...
- You can do magic.
Teach me.
We call it "optics".
The pictures are joined in the spinning.
Truth is not always appearance.
What are you running from, Philipse?
You had a mind to help me.
Yes, and it' s put me in dread of powers against which there is no defense.
- You knew the widow was expecting?
And you are not the child' s father?.
Did she tell you the father' s name?
She came to me for advice as town magistrate, -
- to protect the rights of her child.
I was bound to keep the secret.
- Do you believe the father killed her?.
- The Horseman killed her.
There never will be.
- What is that thing?
- My protection from the Horseman.
A magistrate, full of such nonsense!
Now tell me the name of...
Oh, my God!
Constable Crane?
Has he not come out at all?
- It was a headless horseman!
- You must not excite yourself.
- That' s why you' re here.
- A horseman, a dead one, headless!
- You don' t.
You weren' t there.
It' s true!
I told you.
Everyone told you.
I saw him.
I suppose it' s back to the city, then.
I won' t be fobbed off with an amateur.
- This time, a magistrate' s dead.
- Gentlemen...
I need able men to go with me into the western woods.
- We thought you' d shot your bolt.
- I will find the Horseman' s grave.
I will pit myself against a murdering ghost.
Who' s with me?
The Van Garretts, Widow Winship, your father, and now Philipse.
Something must connect them.
Did your father deal with the Van Garretts?
He worked for them.
We lived in the coach- house.
It' s nothing.
There was an argument between father and son a week before the murder.
My father was later sent for by Mr. Van Garrett.
An argument between father and son.
Elder Van Garrett sent for his servant...
Listen.
- I hear nothing.
- Nor l.
No birds, no crickets, it' s all gone so quiet.
Quicken pace.
Pardon our intrusion, but perhaps you could help us.
- You' re from the Hollow.
- In a way, yes.
I make no assumptions about your occupation, -
- nor your ways, which... which... which...... are nothing to me, whatever you are.
Each to his own.
Do you know of the Horseman, ma' am?
The Hessian?
That' il be him.
You, come with me.
Go out, child.
Keep away.
Whatever you hear, keep away.
What might he hear that he must keep away from?
He rides to the Hollow and back.
I smell the blood on him.
Do you?
Well, I' m here to find him and make him stop.
You seek knowledge of the netherworld.
I can show you.
- What are you doing?
- Don' t move or speak.
- The other?.
Silence.
He comes now.
Madam...
Madam, do you hear me?
You seek the warrior bathed in blood, the Headless Horseman.
Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies, to the Tree of the Dead.
Climb down to the Horseman' s resting place.
We' re leaving now.
- To the Tree of the Dead.
- How will we recognise it?
Without difficulty, I fear.
Then to the Horseman' s resting place.
- His camp?
- His grave.
Stay here.
Halt and turn, I have a pistol aimed!
Katrina!
I might have killed you.
Why have you come?
Because no one else would go with you.
Then I am now twice the man.
It is your white magic.
Pardon my intrusion.
I think you' d better look at this.
The Tree of the Dead.
Blood.
Stay where you are.
- What is it?
- Just stay where you are.
This tree is a gateway between two worlds.
This ground has been disturbed.
The soil is loose.
Bring the shovel.
The skull is gone.
Taken.
That' s why he returns from the grave.
To take heads until his own is restored to him.
Ichabod?
Split up.
Glenn.
- Don' t pick your teeth, it' s a bad habit.
- I am a bad habit.
- There' s nothing for it.
- Oh, isn' t there?
- Let' s get ready for bed.
- Yes.
Beth, run!
Be quiet.
- Wait, he' s not after you.
- I' il get him.
We cannot win this.
Remarkable.
A wound like this should have killed him, -
- but it needs no stitch, and there' s hardly a loss of blood.
- You must be still.
The fever is on you.
- Katrina...
Nostradamus, Mediamus, milk of mercy, in media nos laudamas.
Katrina, I tried to stop Brom...
Drink this down, it will make you sleep.
The Horseman was not set to kill Brom or me.
Had Brom not attacked him...
Later.
Rest now.
The Horseman doesn' t kill at random.
His victims are chosen by that very person who took his skull.
Someone who knew where to dig, of flesh and blood, as I' ve always said.
- These are ravings.
- Drink.
Ichabod...
- You were dreaming.
- Yes.
Of things I had forgotten...... and would not like to remember.
- Tell me what you dreamt.
- My mother was an innocent.
A child of nature.
Condemned.
Murdered... by my father.
- Murdered by..?
- Murdered to save her soul.
By a Bible- black tyrant, behind a mask of righteousness.
I was seven when I lost my faith.
- What do you believe in?
- Sense and reason.
Cause and consequence.
But here my rational mind has been so controverted by the spirit world.
You' il take nothing from Sleepy Hollow that was worth the coming here?
No, not nothing.
A kiss from a lovely young woman, before she saw me or knew my name.
Yes, without sense or reason.
Forgive me.
I speak of kisses, and you' ve lost your brave man Brom.
I have shed my tears for Brom, -
- and yet my heart is not broken.
Do you think me wicked?
No.
But perhaps there is a bit of witch in you.
- Why do you say that?
- Because you' ve bewitched me.
You slept like the dead.
You' re too kind to me.
I don' t look to be served by the lady of the house.
Nor would you be, but that the servant girl has vanished.
- Sarah?
- Run away, like so many others.
They' re all leaving in fear.
Where is Katrina?
She watched over you till dawn.
Now it is her turn to sleep.
I' m fit for another day, I think.
Fit enough to face a mortal adversary.
Dr Lancaster.
Reverend Steenwyck.
Notary Hardenbrook and Magistrate Philipse...... who tried to cut and run, and lost his head.
Four frightened men arguing together on the very night Philipse was killed.
There is conspiracy here.
The doctor, the reverend, the notary and the magistrate.
What is the secret that unites them?
Magistrate Philipse knew there were five bodies to four graves.
He knew the widow was pregnant and would not tell me the father' s name.
What does this point to?
We must proceed by process of elimination.
I' il list everyone in town, starting with its chief citizen, Baltus Van Tassel.
- I feel we' re getting very close.
- Yes...
I suppose Baltus is the chief citizen, now that old Van Garrett is dead.
The Van Garretts...
I' d almost forgotten them.
Come with me, to Notary Hardenbrook' s.
- Have you thought of something?
I have.
Hopeless.
My father' s satchel.
Why is it here?
- Leave me alone.
- Notary Hardenbrook...
Show me the last will and testament of old man Van Garrett.
- The will leaves everything to his son.
- Who died with him.
- The estate passes to the next of kin.
- Naturally.
All legal and above board.
- Sir?.
- I' m a dead man.
No...
Van Garrett' s seal, broken.
Widow Winship?
And here, look.
A marriage certificate.
He secretly married the widow and left everything to her and her unborn child.
It stood between Van Garrett' s fortune and the one who' d have got everything.
It' s true, but we four were drawn in against our will.
- Your will?
- He means...
Of course, the four town elders.
Now I see what parts you had to play.
Steenwyck knew the secret.
He performed the marriage.
Lancaster attended the pregnant woman.
Philipse gave protection of the law.
Hardenbrook concealed documents -
- entrusted by Van Garrett to his faithful servant.
- The conspirators drawn into the plot.
- We knew not it was a murdering plot.
But I have not finished, sir.
First, the Van Garretts slain by a horseman raised from the grave.
Up pops a widow with a claim on the fortune.
Off with her head.
But murder begets murder.
Jonathan Masbath.
The night father and son quarreled over the new will.
Masbath was summoned upstairs to bear witness.
Here is his signature.
I' m afraid it was his death warrant.
The Horseman came for him.
Came for him -
- at the bidding of someone who had power over him, who dug in the earth -
- and stole the skull, which must again be his before he will return to hell.
None other -
- than Van Garrett' s next of kin, Baltas Van Tassel!
- Katrina, why are you in my room?
- Was it wicked of me?
- No, not at all.
- I missed you.
Where did you go?
- I had questions to ask Hardenbrook.
- Did you learn anything of interest?
- Perhaps.
- My father...
- Your father?.
Yes.
My father thinks you should return to New York.
Really?.
Why is that?
Perhaps he looked in your ledger and did not like what he saw.
- What have you there?
- Evidence.
I' m sorry, I must ask you...
Then I' il leave you to your thoughts.
- It' s just a spider.
- Kill it!
- No, stop it!
- There' s something under here.
- What is it?
- Help me move the bed.
No, I mustn' t.
You do it.
The evil eye.
It is someone casting spells against you.
The evil eye...
Wait here.
Katrina...
- You burned the evidence.
- So you would not accuse my father.
I accuse no one.
But if there is guilt, I cannot alter it, even if it grieves me.
No spells of yours can alter it, either.
It is he who profits from these murders.
If you knew him, you' d not have such harsh thoughts about him.
Nor if you felt anything for me.
- Why did his friends conceal..?
You are the constable.
Find another chain of reasoning and let me be.
Nor the one or the other.
And I am heartsick with it.
I think you have no heart, and I had a mind once to give you mine.
Yes, I think you loved me -
- when you followed me into the woods.
To have braved such peril.
What peril was there if it was my father who controlled the Horseman?
Goodbye.
I curse the day you came to Sleepy Hollow.
- She will not see you.
- Did she say anything?
Only that she will not come down.
- I see.
Thank you.
- Constable...
You have not asked me how I hurt my hand since yesterday, -
- which would have been polite.
In fact, you have been as careful not to look at it as not to mention it.
- Yes, I' m sorry.
How did you..?
- I know you saw me.
- What?
- I know you followed last night.
You must promise not to tell my husband what you saw.
Promise me!
The town is in ferment!
Hardenbrook is dead!
- That harmless old man?
- Hanged himself in the night.
- Hanged himself?
- There' s a church meeting tonight.
Everyone is going to speak out against you.
If you are wise, -
- you will leave this place.
What is that?
- I was careless with the kitchen knife.
- The wound looks angry.
I will bind it with arrowroot flowers.
I know where some grow.
Hurry up, the meeting bell has started tolling.
The Horseman!
Katrina, the Horseman saved me!
The Horseman killed your stepmother!
Oh, God!
You' il kill us all!
You' re the one the Horseman wants!
He cannot enter.
The Horseman cannot enter!
He cannot cross the gate.
We have to save ourselves.
The next person to lay a hand on me will get a bullet!
He' s coming back!
- Enough have died.
It' s time to confess.
- What is it that you know?.
Your four friends played you false.
We were possessed by...
Stay back!
There' s a conspiracy here, and I will seek it out!
It was an evil spirit possessed you.
I pray it is satisfied and that you find peace.
The evil eye has done its work.
My life is over.
Spared for a lifetime of horrors in my sleep.
Waking each day to grief.
Goodbye, Katrina.
- You think it was Katrina.
- That can never be uttered.
A strange sort of witch, with a kind and loving heart.
How can you think so?
- You are bewitched by reason.
- I am beaten down by it!
It is a hard lesson for a hard world.
You' d better learn it.
Villainy wears many masks.
None so dangerous as the mask of virtue.
Farewell.
Return the coach!
Turn around now!
Pardon my intrusion.
No blood flow, no clotting, no healing.
When this cut was made, this woman was already dead.
Dear stepdaughter.
You look as if you' d seen a ghost.
Rise up once more, my dark avenger.
One more night of beheading.
Rise up with your sword.
A head for a head.
My unholy horseman, rise.
Come now for Katrina.
Awake at last.
- Did you think it was a nasty dream?
- Father saw the Horseman kill you.
He saw the Horseman come towards me with his sword unsheathed, -
- but it is I who govern the Horseman, and Baltus did not stay to watch.
- But there was a body.
- The servant girl, Sarah.
I always thought she was useless...
... but she had a purpose after all.
- Who are you?
- My family name was Archer.
The archer?.
I lived with my father, mother and sister in a cottage not far from here.
My father died, and the landlord, whom we' d served faithfully, evicted us.
No one would take us in, because my mother was suspected of witchcraft.
She schooled her daughters well, while we lived as outcasts in the woods.
She died within a year.
My sister and I remained in our refuge, seeing not a soul.
Until one day, gathering firewood, we crossed the path of the Messian.
At that moment, I offered my soul to Satan, -
- if he would raise the Hessian from the grave to avenge me.
- Avenge you?
- Against Van Garrett!
The landlord who showed us no mercy and left us to starve, -
- whilst Baltus and his simpering wife and girl child stole our home.
I swore I' d make myself mistress of all he had.
The easiest was to enter your house as your mother' s sick- nurse, -
- and put her body into the grave, and my own into the marriage bed.
Not quite so easy was to secure my legacy.
The widow had to go, -
- and the servant Masbath.
Just the other day, that silly midwife Killian -
- told me the widow had told her a big secret.
And she told me this right in front of her husband!
What a goose!
So, another little job for the Horseman.
But lust delivered the Rev. Steenwyck into my power.
Fear did the same for Hardenbrook and the drunkard Philipse.
And the doctor' s silence I exchanged for my complicity -
- in his fornications with the servant girl Sarah.
- Yes, you have everything now.
- No, you have, my dear.
I get everything in the event of your death.
Oh, my sister, by the way, sadly passed away.
Quite recently.
- You killed your own sister.
- She brought it on herself.
By helping you and your master!
You' re just in time to have your head cut off.
Tonight the Horseman comes for you!
Katrina!
Thank God.
Watch your head.
To the roof.
I have an idea.
Jump in the sails!
Jump!
Hurry!
- Is he dead?
- He was dead to begin with.
- Where are we going?
- Anywhere but here.
Take the reins.
My bag!
Jump!
- Still alive?
- Run, Katrina.
Yes, do run and jump and skip.
Here, take her!
She' s yours!
Sir, you' re not dead!
Horseman!
Just in time for a new century.
You' il soon get your bearings, young Masbath.
The Bronx is up, the Battery' s down, and home is this way.
ENGLlSH
Let' s stick together.
Weyland.
It would seem that we are rats in a maze.
Sorry.
Connors?
Connors!
Verheiden?
Verheiden?
- Oh, God.
- Dr. Miller!
Get me outta here!
OK?
Verheiden!
No!
You want a piece of me?
You ugly son of a bitch!
Oh, God.
Weyland.
- You OK?
- Yeah, I' m fine.
They can only slow us down.
Too much has been lost to leave here with nothing.
Give it to me.
Max.
Hold on.
Look out!
We have to get Weyland.
Weyland, come on.
- What were they?
- You' re the expert.
I' ve got to stop.
Take it easy.
Weyland.
Look at me.
You have to slow your breathing down.
Slow, steady breaths.
- Weyland, come on.
- I can hardly stand.
I' m not gonna let you die down here.
You didn' t.
- There' s another one.
We have to go.
Now!
- Weyland.
- Come with us.
- Get her outta here.
- Now!
- Come on.
Run!
Don' t turn your back on me.
Wait.
This way.
Go!
Go!
Look over here.
- He' s marking himself.
- What?
Ancient warriors would mark themselves with the blood of their kill.
It' s a rite of passage.
This is starting to make sense.
The hieroglyphs are a little difficult to make out.
But the story is all here.
Thousands of years ago, these hunters found a backwater planet.
They taught humans how to build and were worshipped as gods.
Every hundred years the gods would return.
And when they did, they would expect a sacrifice.
Humans were used to breed the ultimate prey.
The hunters would battle with these great serpents to prove themselves worthy to carry the mark.
But if the hunters lost, they made sure nothing survived.
An entire civilization wiped out overnight.
So... the humanoids, the hunters - they brought those creatures here to hunt?
And they use us like cattle.
We' re hosts for them to breed in.
The heat bloom was the sign to lure us down here.
This whole thing was a trap.
Without us, there could be no hunt.
Shit!
Verheiden!
Oh, shit.
When that door opens, we' re dead.
- Not if we set things right.
- What do you mean?
This pyramid is like a prison.
We took the guards' guns, and now the prisoners are running free.
To restore order, the guards need their guns.
When that door opens, we' re gonna give that thing his gun back.
Are you crazy?
During a big- game hunt, the animals being hunted don' t arm the hunters.
They' re not hunting us.
We' re in the middle of a war.
- It' s time to pick a side.
- We are on our side.
We have to consider the possibility that we might not make it out of here.
But we have to make sure those serpents don' t reach the surface.
Because if they do, everything everywhere could die.
The enemy of my enemy... is my friend.
Let' s go find our friend.
How do you say "scared shitless" in Italian?
Non vedo I' ora di uscire con te da questa piramide perché mi sto cagando addosso.
More or less.
Move!
Lex.
Lex.
Hold on.
Come on, Lex.
Oh, no.
Please, wait.
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
I' m coming with you.
You hear me, you ugly creature?
What are you doing?
Miller!
Miller!
Sebastian.
- Help me, Lex.
- I' m gonna get you out of there.
It' s inside me.
- I' m gonna get you outta here.
- You can' t...
- No!
No.
No.
No!
No!
I have to help him.
Lex!
They mustn' t reach the surface.
They mustn' t reach the surface.
I know.
Do it!
I' m sorry.
I' m sorry.
It' s a bomb.
Well, I hope it kills every fucking one of 'em.
You are one ugly mother...
Got it!
